0,"Whether a sign of a good read; or a comment on the 'pulp' nature of some genres of fiction, the Oxfam second-hand book charts have remained in The Da Vinci Code author's favour for the past four years. 
 
 Dan Brown has topped Oxfam's 'most donated' list again, his fourth consecutive year. Having sold more than 80 million copies of The Da Vinci Code and had all four of his novels on the New York Times bestseller list in the same week, it's hardly surprising that Brown's hefty tomes are being donated to charity by readers keen to make some room on their shelves. 
 
 Another cult crime writer responsible to heavy-weight hardbacks, Stieg Larsson, is Oxfam's 'most sold' author for the second time in a row. Both the 'most donated' and 'most sold' lists are dominated by crime fiction, trilogies and fantasy, with JK Rowling the only female author listed in either of the Top Fives.

 SAN FRANCISCO The latest novel from ""Da Vinci Code"" author Dan Brown, ""The Lost Symbol,"" broke one-day sales records, its publisher and booksellers said. 
 
 Readers snapped up over one million hardcover copies across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom after it was released on Tuesday, said publisher Knopf Doubleday, a division of Random House Inc. 
 
 ""We are seeing historic, record-breaking sales across all types of our accounts in North America for 'The Lost Symbol,"" said Sonny Mehta, editor in chief of Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Knopf Doubleday is a division of Random House Inc. 
 
 Amazon.com Inc, the world's largest online retailer, called the book its bestselling first-day adult fiction title ever, including pre-orders. 
 
 Barnes & Noble Inc said ""The Lost Symbol"" broke its previous one-day sales record for adult fiction. 
 
 The success of the Dan Brown's latest is a boost to publisher Knopf Doubleday and booksellers, which have endured sliding sales in the midst of the recession. 
 
 Booksellers have anxiously awaited a popular title that will resonate with readers and fuel the same sort of frenzy seen earlier this decade with the ""Harry Potter"" series, from author J.K. Rowling. 
 
 But the $25 billion domestic book market has wallowed in a slump in recent years as more readers make their purchases online, or forego books altogether for online games and other forms of media and entertainment. 
 
 Now, digital books and electronic reading devices such as Amazon's Kindle or Sony Corp's Reader are seen as both avenues of growth and sources of competition for traditional media, and publishers and booksellers are scrambling to respond. 
 
 The highly anticipated book from Brown comes six years after the release of the American novelist's last book ""The Da Vinci Code"". It follows the adventures of Harvard professor Robert Langdon and is set in the secret world of Freemasons in Washington D.C. 
 
 ""The Da Vinci Code"" sold 80 million copies worldwide. It was made into a film starring Tom Hanks that grossed more than $758 million, according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo. 
 
 Shares of Amazon closed up $7.15 to $90.70 on the Nasdaq. Amazon was upgraded to a ""Buy"" rating by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which cited a resurgence in e-commerce that would benefit the Seattle-based company. 
 
 Barnes & Noble closed up 14 cents to $22.04 and book retailer Borders Group Inc closed up 2 cents to $3.29, on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Dan Brown might be one of the world's bestselling authors but it turns out that readers aren't too keen on keeping his special blend of religious conspiracy and scholarly derring-do on their shelves once they've bought it. 
 
 Brown, who has sold more than 81m copies of The Da Vinci Code worldwide, has been revealed as the most donated author to Oxfam's 700 high street shops. With just four books to his name – although his long-awaited fifth The Lost Symbol is published next month – Brown did well to see off competition from John Grisham, author of more than 20 and the second-most likely writer to be ditched in a charity shop by readers. 
 
 But as secondhand bookshop shelves flood with battered editions of Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress, Brown can comfort himself with the fact that he's also Oxfam's second most bought author: there are, apparently, still readers out there who have yet to follow the adventures of the dapper symbologist Robert Langdon. There's no such consolation for Grisham, whose legal thrillers fail to make Oxfam's bestseller charts at all. 
 
 ""There's no question that when you go into the back room of Oxfam shops there are many Dan Brown books,"" said Oxfam's director of trading David McCullough. ""But he's also very high on the bestseller list so there is a useful recycling exercise going on – it's not just people saying 'I've read The Da Vinci Code and now I must get rid of it'."" 
 
 Ian Rankin, whose dour, boozy detective John Rebus is no Robert Langdon, tops Oxfam's bestseller list, which the charity says is the first ever high-street secondhand bestseller chart. ""It's always good for an author to know that their books are popular,"" said the Scottish author, who will unveil a new policeman hero, the teetotal Malcolm Fox, next month. ""With Oxfam, it's also heartening to realise that each book donated and bought is helping such a worthwhile organisation."" 
 
 Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight series and instigator of myriad teenage crushes courtesy of her sparkly vampire hero Edward Cullen, is also sitting high in Oxfam's charts, nestling between Bernard Cornwell and Terry Pratchett. 
 
 Margaret Atwood, meanwhile, winner of the Booker prize and author of a host of critically acclaimed works of fiction, scrapes into the list in eighth place, keeping unlikely company with thriller powerhouse James Patterson – currently producing at least eight books a year thanks to a horde of co-writers – and Jodi Picoult, never afraid to jerk a tear or pile on the plot twists. 
 
 ""We just need to dispel the idea that we are sitting there in Oxfam with only first editions of literary gems – actually we've got shelves of really good fiction,"" said McCullough. ""Waterstone's might be more upset than secondhand booksellers,"" he added, referring to the recent slew of complaints from secondhand booksellers that the charity is stealing their business. 
 
 Oxfam, Europe's biggest high-street retailer of secondhand books and the third-biggest bookseller in the UK, launched a drive for book donations in May ahead of its first national book festival, Bookfest, in July. Authors including Joanna Trollope, Philip Pullman and Jonathan Coe all lent a hand in shops across the country as part of the festival, and the drive saw book donations rise 40%, with sales up by more than 10%. 
 
 Rare books and first editions have also been pouring into shops since May. Ten of the most sought-after editions have raised more than £4,500 for the charity between them. A first edition of Lord of the Rings sold for £800, a first edition of Watership Down brought in £500, Sylvia Plath's Ariel sold for £350, Ian Fleming's From Russia With Love for £300 and a second printing of Martin Chuzzlewit for £200. 
 
 Oxfam, which has more than 130 specialist bookshops and stocks books in almost all of its 700 stores, sells £1.6m-worth of books a month – equivalent, it says, to 50,000 emergency shelters, 64,000 goats or safe water for 2.1 million people.

 The Oxfam shop in Swansea has been receiving an average of one copy of the Dan Brown novel a week for months, leaving them with little room for any other books. 
 
 Staff who are struggling to sell copies of the book have put a note up in the store saying they would rather donors hand in their vinyl instead.","– The Da Vinci Code has sold so many copies—that would be at least 80 million—that it's bound to turn up in book donation piles. But at one charity shop in the UK, it's been donated so heavily that the shop has posted a sign propped up on a tower of Da Vinci Code copies that reads: ""You could give us another Da Vinci Code... but we would rather have your vinyl!"" The manager of the Oxfam shop in Swansea tells the Telegraph that people are laughing and taking pictures of the sizable display: ""I would say that we get one copy of the book every day."" He says people buy them ""occasionally,"" but with vinyl sales up 25% in the past year, they'd rather take records. Dan Brown's book isn't the only one that shops like Oxfam struggle to re-sell. Last year, Oxfam was hit with a large and steady supply of Fifty Shades of Grey, and it similarly begged donors: ""Please—no more."" But Brown has a particular kind of staying power. The Da Vinci Code was published in 2003, and within six years Brown had booted John Grisham from the No. 1 slot on the list of writers whose books were most often donated to Oxfam's 700 shops, reported the Guardian at the time. The Independent in 2012 reported Brown's best-seller was the most-donated book for the fourth year running.

1,"The deaths of three American soldiers in Afghanistan this week are a tragic reminder of why it’s so important for the nation to keep its promises to military men and women, Veterans, no matter where they served, have volunteered to put their lives on the line — and some make the ultimate sacrifice. Those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they’ve earned. 
 
 Unfortunately, financial aid has been late or gone AWOL this fall for thousands of veterans and their families relying on the GI Bill to get through school. The reason: a big information-technology glitch that surfaced with what seemed like a relatively minor change in how the aid is calculated. 
 
 While the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is trying to fix this, a lack of communication by the agency about the delays, coupled with inaction by the U.S. Senate, has left service members-turned-students facing severe financial hardships. This week, the agency was still working to process more than 58,000 student aid claims. 
 
 On Wednesday, the VA announced that the information technology fixes will not be completed until December 2019 — more than a year past the original Aug. 1 deadline for finishing this work. This is a national disgrace, one that should prompt congressional leadership to move quickly on short- and long-term solutions. A good start would be swift passage of a Senate bill that would prohibit schools from penalizing student veterans for late VA assistance payments. This would address a major concern that students with accounts in arrears due to delayed payments may not be allowed to enroll for 2019 coursework. Given that the VA has said the tech problems will continue until the end of 2019, this protection is a sensible step. 
 
 The House merits praise for unanimously passing hold-students-harmless legislation, which has been dubbed the “SIT-REP” bill. But the legislation is bogged down in the Senate. 
 
 “If ever there was a time that it was obvious this bill needed to be passed, now is the time,” said Tanya Ang, vice president of the Veterans Education Success organization, in a statement provided for a Nov. 15 House Veterans Affairs subcommittee hearing. 
 
 Other testimony provided at the hearing made it clear that long-term solutions are urgently needed, too. The VA has lacked a permanent chief information officer since January 2017, which is unacceptable given how technology is so critical to delivering service members’ benefits. 
 
 President Donald Trump nominated a well-qualified Minnesota native, James Gfrerer, last summer, but the Senate has yet to confirm him. The Senate is expected to take this up soon, but the delay is inexcusable. 
 
 Both houses of Congress also need to scrutinize a much larger problem — the antiquated IT systems relied on by the VA and other federal agencies. A statement provided to the House by Booz Allen Hamilton, the private contractor originally hired to update the VA system, makes clear the root of the GI Bill problem: “The unfortunate delay has been caused by the confluence of outdated systems being asked to perform ever complex tasks.” 
 
 A 2016 Government Accountability Office report put the age of the VA’s benefits delivery platform at more than a half century. At that time, other agencies, such as the Treasury Department, also had so-called “legacy systems” in that age range. “Many use outdated software and hardware parts that are unsupported,” the report warned. 
 
 The GI Bill delay shows how a tweak to these dated systems can be complicated and time-consuming. There’s likely little appetite in Congress to tackle the daunting task of modernization, but leadership is sorely needed. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

 Nov. 29, 2018, 1:40 AM GMT / Updated Nov. 29, 2018, 1:52 AM GMT By Phil McCausland 
 
 For weeks, student veterans across the country have raised an alarm about delayed or incorrect GI Bill benefit payments, which the Department of Veterans Affairs has blamed on computer issues. 
 
 But on Wednesday, the department told congressional staffers that it would not reimburse those veterans who were paid less than they were owed, two committee aides told NBC News. 
 
 The news conflicts with a promise VA officials made to a House committee earlier this month that it would reimburse those veterans who received less than the full amount they were due. 
 
 According to the aides, however, the VA said it could not make retroactive payments without auditing its previous education claims, which it said would delay future claims. The aides asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. 
 
 NBC News previously reported that some veterans were forced into desperate financial straits stemming from a change in calculating housing allowances under the Forever GI Bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July 2017. When its computers were unable to process that change, the VA quickly faced a backlog of veterans’ claims three times higher than normal. 
 
 Because of those issues, the VA had announced earlier on Wednesday that it would delay the Forever GI Bill housing allowance changes until December 2019 — and again promised that retroactive payments would be made to those who did not receive a correct amount. 
 
 But VA officials told congressional staffers in a telephone call on Wednesday morning that once the system is made right next year, they will not make retroactive payments to those who were underpaid because of the housing miscalculations. 
 
 ""They are essentially going to ignore the law and say that that change only goes forward from December 2019,"" one aide told NBC News. 
 
 The reason the VA decided that it would not make the retroactive payments is because it would have to audit all its previous education claims prior to December 2019, meaning the VA would potentially have to inspect 2 million claims, the aide said. 
 
 VA officials said this could cause further delays in processing future claims, according to the aides, an issue that caused some veterans to suffer earlier this year. 
 
 While this decision could mean the agency is flouting the law because it would not provide the correct amount of money to student veterans as required by two sections of the Forever GI Bill, the VA told the congressional staffers that they have a legal justification that would allow them to move forward with this decision. 
 
 They did not share that justification, however. 
 
 When asked for comment, a VA spokesman did not address the issue directly. Instead he reiterated that the agency would delay paying housing allowances in accordance with the new Forever GI Bill until the spring term of 2020 and instead pay housing allowances based on Department of Defense's older Basic Housing Allowance rates. 
 
 Attempting to implement the law would put “an enormous administrative burden for schools in which some 35,000 certifying officials would have to track retroactively and re-certify hundreds of thousands of enrollment documents,” Curtis Cashour, the VA spokesman, said over email. 
 
 Cashour also said that students who were overpaid because of the law’s changes or because of issues in implementing the law “will not be held liable for the debt.” 
 
 But he did not comment on those who were underpaid and rampant confusion continues to surround the issue, as it is unknown how many students have been underpaid thus far, how many more could be underpaid because of the changes to the law and how much money these veterans are owed. 
 
 Congressional aides described the situation as “frustrating.” One, who commented on the shifting answers and constant confusion stemming from VA, asked, “I mean, am I taking crazy pills?” 
 
 Under Secretary for Benefits Paul Lawrence is scheduled to testify Thursday morning before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
 
 One of the committee aides said that members of Congress will attempt to clear this issue up before they move forward with the hearing. 
 
 “They need to figure it out,” the aide said. ||||| After blowing through the initial deadline to bring its GI Bill housing stipends in line with the Forever GI Bill law, Veterans Affairs Department officials said Wednesday that they will not be able to implement the fix until December 2019. 
 
 The big delay comes after months of technology hiccups that have plagued the agency, which failed to meet the original Aug. 1 deadline to put the changes in place. These problems have contributed to a backlog of claims for veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to attend school this fall, and the agency has come under fire in recent months as thousands of student veterans have had to wait longer than usual for their tuition and housing payments. 
 
 “Redesigning the way (Veterans Benefits Administration) calculates Post-9/11 GI Bill housing rates during a busy academic season was like flying a plane while building it, and that was unfair and frustrating to veterans and taxpayers. That’s why we are resetting our implementation of the law for the next year to ensure we get the technology and formula right to put Veterans first,” VA Sec. Robert Wilkie said in a news release. “In the meantime, beneficiaries receiving Post 9/11 GI Bill housing allowances will be paid at the DoD (basic housing allowance) rate, which in many cases will be equal to or higher than their current payment.” 
 
 Rebootcamp Recommendations 
 
 Congressional leaders who have taken the VA to task for the slow implementation said Wednesday they are glad Wilkie is choosing to focus on getting student veterans their payments, even if it means pushing back the deadline for the IT updates to be completed. 
 
 “While I am disappointed that the VA does not yet have an effective IT system in place, I understand Secretary Wilkie’s decision to reset implementation of certain sections of the ‘Forever’ GI Bill while improvements continue to be made,” Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said in a statement. “Right now, the VA’s priority must be to ensure accurate payments are sent to student veterans in a timely manner. Student veterans rely on the GI Bill to support themselves and their families while they are in school, and the VA is responsible for keeping those payments going, even as it implements the new law.” 
 
 Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., whose House Committee on Veterans Affairs’ pressed VA leaders for a new deadline in a hearing on Capitol Hill earlier this month, said Wilkie’s move “will ensure that monthly housing payments are made with minimal delays.” 
 
 Both lawmakers said they would continue their efforts to hold the VA accountable. ||||| CLOSE Dr. Hilary Miller of MTSU works with veteran students on the GI Bill that are affected by VA technical difficulties Mark Zaleski and Michael Schwab 
 
 Staff Sergeant Robert Baker and his family have been affected by VA tech issues that has delayed GI Bill Benefits for months (Photo: Submitted) 
 
 Staff Sgt. Robert Baker was so stressed about money that he made a “spur of the moment decision” and dropped out of all his classes. 
 
 It was already October and he hadn’t received his GI Bill benefits for the start of his fall semester at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville. 
 
 The 30-year-old communications major and his wife, in her last semester of nursing school, are full-time students. At home, they have three young kids, ages 2 to 6. 
 
 “I freaked out,” Baker said in an interview with the USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee. “I told them I was going to fall behind on my mortgage. I was expecting to be paid by the VA, but since it wasn’t happening, I needed to get to work.” 
 
 His wife had already picked up a second job bartending to make ends meet. 
 
 “They’re too young to know about the money aspect, but they know mommy is gone so much,” Baker said of his kids, who he watches at alone at night after a day of classes. “They were feeling our stress.” 
 
 Baker left the Army this summer after 12 years in the service, including deployments to Iraq in 2008 and Kuwait in 2012. He was stationed in Fort Campbell for four years. 
 
 He wanted to take advantage of his GI Bill so he enrolled for classes just a month after the Army discharged him. But the money never came, he said. 
 
 ""We were just shocked. We were angry because we figured this would be automatic,"" Baker said. ""Come to find out, there were big problems going on at the VA."" 
 
 There are many veterans, like Baker, in Tennessee and across the country who are still waiting for the Department of Veterans Affairs to clear a backlog created after President Donald Trump signed the Forever GI BIll in 2017. 
 
 While the landmark legislation expanded benefits for a new generation of veterans and their families, it didn’t upgrade the VA’s antiquated technical capabilities to account for those changes. 
 
 Problems are centered within the VA’s Office of Information Technology, which is tasked with implementing the change to how housing allowances are calculated, the VA said. 
 
 The new bill changed it so that veterans housing would be based on the school’s ZIP code, rather that where the veteran lived. Problems arose when the VA attempted to stress test their outdated system, as well as a contract dispute. As a result, the VA waited until July 16 to tell schools to begin enrolling students. 
 
 The delay caused a backlog of claims, meaning thousands of students had to wait for their benefits just as they were headed back to school for the fall semester. Post-Sept. 11 military-affiliated students, particularly first-time students like Baker, were mostly impacted. 
 
 On Nov. 14, state Rep. Jay Reedy, R-Erin, and leaders in the Tennessee House and Senate wrote a letter to U.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Johnson City, and members of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs urging them to take immediate action. Roe chairs the committee. 
 
 Nationally there are fewer than 1,000 Veterans who have an education claim that has been pending over 60 days and less than 10,000 who have a claim that’s been pending for over 30 days, as of Nov. 28, according to VA spokesman Curt Cashour. 
 
 Universities step in to help students 
 
 But where the VA failed, universities across the state have stepped up to help students. 
 
 Many schools are utilizing 0 percent interest loans and tuition deferment as ways to ensure student veterans receive the financial support they need continue their education. 
 
 As a result, institutional funds at several schools have been heavily drawn down, creating budget concerns. 
 
 Baker said after he dropped his classes, he came to the realization that he would have to pay the school back for the months he's already been in class. 
 
 ""It was just going to hurt me more financially. I was freaking out and called admissions,"" he said. ""They said 'It's OK. We'll fix it.'"" 
 
 APSU has some 2,400 military-affiliated students on campus, according to retired Brig. Gen. Scott Brower, who joined the institution this year as its first military adviser in residence. 
 
 About $960,000 in tuition was deferred by the university for students impacted by the delay, and 83 students have taken out short-term loans offered by the school, totaling $175,000, according to Brower. 
 
 ""We recognize this is on the VA and that they will fix this problem. We've been treating it with good faith, knowing that money is not available for them right now,"" he said. ""We want to make sure we are doing everything we can so that students are continuing on their goal for degree completion."" 
 
 Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro has done the same for its students, according to Hilary Miller, the director of the Daniels Center, a resource for the nearly 1,100 veterans and military families on campus. 
 
 “It was terrible,” she said, speaking of the delays. She said about 682 students receive post 9/11 benefits.

 Miller said the school deferred their tuition and had short-term loans available for students to hold them over until their benefits had been processed. The school also had template letters for students to use with landlords explaining their situation. 
 
 “We asked our community members to extend grace to our veterans and that this was nothing the veterans did,” she said. 
 
 Students reached out to say that they couldn't pay for books and that it impacted their productivity in the classroom. The school contacted staff and faculty to make sure they were aware of the situation and asked if they could make copies of textbook pages in certain cases. 
 
 ""We did everything we could do to make it easier, but if you're not getting paid for a couple of months, there's not a lot we can do to make it easier,"" Miller said. 
 
 VA's 'alarm' didn't go off 
 
 The delays varied greatly for students at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. Some students were processed within 72 hours, but in many cases, students had to wait months to see any money. 
 
 “We were calling a month later, then two months later and (the VA) said. ‘We meant to get to that,’” said Antonio Banchs, the director of veterans affairs at East Tennessee State. 
 
 “It was as if they put in an alarm clock or something,"" Banchs said. ""But it never went off.” 
 
 As of mid-November, Banchs said all of the roughly 1,000 veteran-affiliated students on campus had at last received their benefits. But it came with costs. 
 
 “Some were put in a financial hardship,” he said. “Especially our first-time students who went through a more rigorous process.”

 In Memphis, at least one student a day for three months came in to complain about their benefits, said Jeffrey Jones, the coordinator of veterans education benefits for University of Memphis. 
 
 Complaints ramped up by the end of September when students realized that the VA was taking longer than expected to send them their benefits, he said. 
 
 “It looks as if the majority of problems has been resolved now,"" Jones said. ""But, now we’re at then end of our term."" 
 
 The University of Tennessee in Knoxville reported no issues with their 455 veteran and military students, according to Jayetta Rogers, veteran services coordinator. 
 
 Vanderbilt University also said they didn't hear from any of their students regarding their GI Bill benefits. 
 
 ""Vanderbilt has a relatively small number of veteran students and we were able to submit their benefits early, in anticipation of the VA’s regulatory changes,"" the university said in a statement. 
 
 Concerns for spring semester 
 
 Miller, at MTSU, said that staff at the veterans center has tracked the issue since last spring and told their students in advance about possible delays. The institution also used the summer to train staff. 
 
 ""We started at that time really trying to ramp up what we are doing,"" Miller said. ""I think we mitigated a lot of the problem before it happened."" 
 
 Ten students are left to be paid as of mid-November. Miller said she is concerned that nothing has changed for the new spring semester and that the VA hasn't provided any clarity. 
 
 ""We're not really sure what's going to happen. From what we are hearing, it's not resolved. There's not a time in which they foresee it being resolved,"" she said. 
 
 ""The VA keeps saying nobody has dropped out. I find that to be a very odd measurement of success,"" Miller said. ""What about those who didn't eat for a month? Or who couldn't afford housing?"" 
 
 Baker said he finally received his check on Nov. 1. 
 
 ""I was ecstatic just because I figured I still wouldn't get paid 'til spring semester,"" he said. 
 
 He said 12 days after he was backpaid by the VA, he enrolled for his classes for spring. 
 
 ""I'll stay enrolled until I can't,"" he said, before being interrupted by man asking for money. 
 
 ""I get that,"" Baker said, handing the man some change. ""That's all I've got, sir.""

Those that began using benefits prior to January 1, 2018 will continue to receive a higher monthly housing rate based in the non-adjusted BAH rates.","– A major snafu has hit benefit payments to student veterans under the GI Bill—and congressional aides tells NBC that they have been told the veterans are never going to be paid back. The aides say they were told by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the VA will not be making retroactive payments to veterans who were underpaid for their housing allowance because it would mean reviewing around 2 millions claims, further delaying implementation of a new system, which has already been pushed back to Dec. 2019. Under the Forever GI Bill signed into law by President Trump last year, students are supposed to be paid housing allowance based on where they take the most classes, not on where the school's main campus is located. Tanya Ang, vice president of Veterans Education Success, tells the Military Times that the VA's excuse of retroactive payments creating too much work isn't good enough. ""That could be hundreds of dollars for some students—per month,"" she says. ""If this was a disability benefit, this would never fly."" The issue, which is the result of new legislation being introduced before the VA's outdated computer system could handle it, has contributed to a backlog of claims that has forced some veterans facing financial hardship to abandon their studies, the Tennessean reports. The agency is still working to process more than 58,000 claims, reports the Star Tribune. The paper's editorial board calls the delays a ""national disgrace.""

2,"DUBAI Al Qaeda in Yemen has claimed responsibility for the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, saying it was ordered by the Islamist militant group's leadership for insults to the Prophet Mohammad, according to a video posted on YouTube. 
 
 Gunmen killed 17 people in three days of violence that began when they shot staff in Charlie Hebdo's offices last week in revenge for the publication of satirical images of the Prophet. 
 
 One Western source said no hard evidence of a direct operational link to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had yet been found. 
 
 But it was the first time that a group had officially claimed responsibility for the attack, which was led by Cherif and Said Kouachi, two French-born brothers of Algerian extraction who had visited Yemen in 2011. 
 
 In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States believed the video was authentic but officials were still determining if the claim of responsibility is true. 
 
 ""As for the blessed Battle of Paris, we...claim responsibility for this operation as vengeance for the Messenger of God,"" Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, an AQAP ideologue, said in the recording. 
 
 Ansi said the ""one who chose the target, laid the plan and financed the operation is the leadership of the organization"", without naming an individual. 
 
 ""ZAWAHRI'S ORDERS"" 
 
 He added that the strike had been carried out in ""implementation"" of the order of overall al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri, who has urged Muslims to attack the West using any means they can find. 
 
 Ansi also gave credit for the operation to slain AQAP propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, a preacher cited by one of the gunmen in remarks to French media as a financier of the attack. 
 
 It was not clear how Awlaki, killed by a U.S. drone in 2011, had a direct link to the Paris assault, but he inspired several militants in the United States and Britain to acts of violence. 
 
 The purported claim of responsibility put a new spotlight on a group often cited by Western officials as al Qaeda's most dangerous branch. AQAP has recently focused on fighting government forces and Shi'ite rebels in Yemen, but says it still aims to carry out attacks abroad. 
 
 AQAP mocked a huge rally of solidarity for the victims held in Paris on Sunday, saying the shock on display showed the feebleness of the Western leaders who attended. 
 
 ""Look at how they gathered, rallied and supported each other, strengthening their weakness and dressing their wounds,"" it said. 
 
 Al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State released a video that it said showed interviews with three French fighters in Syria praising the attacks, the SITE monitoring service reported. 
 
 One said: ""I say to the French people who think that the Islamic State will not reach Europe: With permission from Allah the Almighty, we will reach Europe – all of Europe."" 
 
 ""JOY AT TORMENT"" 
 
 SITE also said Nigeria's Boko Haram group had released a video showing its leader welcoming the attacks. “We have felt joy for what befell the people of France in terms of torment, as their blood was spilled inside their country. Allah is Great!"" Abubakar Shekau said in the recording, according to SITE. 
 
 One Western source described Ansi as an Al Qaeda hawk reputed to have advocated a merger with the even more hardline Islamic State. 
 
 Two senior Yemeni sources said Cherif and Said Kouachi had met Awlaki in Yemen and undergone weapons training in the eastern province of Marib. However, a Marib tribal leader denied that they had trained there in 2011 or that Awlaki had been based there. 
 
 AQAP's Yemeni leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, was once a close associate of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in Yemen, a neighbor of Saudi Arabia. 
 
 Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi complained on Wednesday that Yemen had been subjected to a politicized media campaign over the alleged 2011 visit. 
 
 ""The person reported to have traveled to Yemen to learn in three days how to fire a pistol had been detained and under investigation for two years in France,"" Hadi said, according to the state news agency Saba. Hadi asked why such suspicious elements had been allowed to travel to Yemen and return home without being questioned.

 Millions more copies of French weekly Charlie Hebdo are being printed after the first run sold out in hours. 
 
 The normal print run of 60,000 was extended to five million - a week after Islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at the magazine's offices and five others in subsequent attacks in Paris. 
 
 The ""survivors' issue"" has angered some Muslims by depicting the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. 
 
 A video purportedly from al-Qaeda in Yemen said it planned the Hebdo attack. 
 
 US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said they believed the video was authentic but could not determine if its claims were true. 
 
 The group, AQAP, had previously welcomed the attack, without acknowledging any role in the operation. 
 
 The gunmen are said to have used earlier publication of images of the Prophet as justification for their attack on the magazine. 
 
 Charlie Hebdo's latest cover shows a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad weeping while holding a sign saying ""I am Charlie"", and below the headline ""All is forgiven"". 
 
 Image copyright Reuters Image caption People waited for kiosks to open to buy the magazine 
 
 Image copyright AP Image caption All copies of the magazine were sold out by Wednesday morning at this Paris newsstand 
 
 Image copyright AP Image caption Some kiosks said they had received dozens of reservation requests 
 
 ""I am Charlie"" emerged as a message of support for the magazine following the attack on 7 January, which left eight journalists, including its editor, dead in addition to four others. 
 
 In a separate attack in Paris two days later, an Islamist gunman killed four Jewish men and took hostages at a kosher shop. 
 
 The same attacker is believed to have shot a policewoman the day before. 
 
 'Charlie is alive' 
 
 Normally Charlie Hebdo prints 60,000 copies but the planned run increased steadily this week - from one million to three million to five million.

 The ""survivors' issue"", as the magazine calls it, is available in six languages including English, Arabic and Turkish. Proceeds are going to victims' families. 
 
 President Francois Hollande has insisted the magazine and its values will continue. 
 
 ""Charlie Hebdo is alive and will live on,"" he said. ""You can assassinate men and women but you will never kill their ideas."" 
 
 Charlie Hebdo's decision to publish another cartoon of the Prophet drew threats from militant Islamist websites and criticism from the Islamic world. 
 
 Image copyright AFP Image caption On Sunday, about 1.5 million people rallied in Paris in a show of solidarity with the victims 
 
 The Islamic State (IS) militant group said it was ""an extremely stupid act"". 
 
 Meanwhile, a new video apparently from AQAP said the group had planned and financed the Charlie Hebdo attacks in ""vengeance for the Prophet"". 
 
 It said it was a ""success"" that the magazine shootings had ""coincided"" with the attacks by supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly. 
 
 Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner 
 
 The video purporting to come from AQAP does appear to be genuine but questions remain over just how closely AQAP was really involved in last week's Paris attacks. More than two years have elapsed since Said Kouachi, one of the three gunmen, is believed to have slipped out of Yemen after spending time there with al-Qaeda members, including the extremist preacher Anwar Al-Awlaki. 
 
 He is mentioned in the video in connection with the attack planning but Al-Awlaki was killed back in 2011 in a US drone strike so, again, that would be a long time to plan such a relatively simple but devastating attack. 
 
 It is also odd that AQAP have not issued any so-called ""martyrdom videos"", showing the perpetrators giving their justifications ahead of the raid. 
 
 These may still be to come but for now it seems the connection between the Paris attackers and AQAP is more one of inspiration, ideology and training rather than close direction and leadership. 
 
 Were gunmen aided by terror network? 
 
 Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to IS in a video message while the Charlie Hebdo attackers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had said they were acting on behalf of AQAP. 
 
 Coulibaly had said they had co-ordinated the attacks but experts say it is highly unlikely IS and AQAP, rivals in the Middle East, would work together. 
 
 Meanwhile a lawyer for Said Kouachi's wife, Soumya, has told the BBC she had no idea he was an extremist. He said Kouachi had kissed his wife goodbye and told her he was visiting his brother, because he was unwell, just hours before the Charlie Hebdo attack. 
 
 ""It's beyond her understanding, her world has fallen apart,"" the lawyer, Antoine Flasaquier, said.

 Outside France, the Washington Post, Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine, Corriere della Sera in Italy and the UK's Guardian are among publications that have shown the latest cartoon.

 Three days of terror","– Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack in an online video called ""Vengeance for the Prophet: A Message Regarding the Blessed Battle of Paris,"" the New York Times reports. The group says it ""chose the target, laid the plan, and financed the operation"" in ""a vengeance for the messenger of Allah""—a likely reference to Charlie Hebdo's parodies of the Prophet Muhammad. But while AQAP called the Kouachi brothers ""two heroes of Islam,"" it suggests it wasn't behind the attacks that followed, including on a kosher supermarket. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly's actions were a coincidence, the statement says, calling him simply a ""mujahid brother.""

 In March, the company suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, and said it was launching an independent investigation to determine if the company engaged in any wrongdoing in its work on political campaigns.

 On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica employees learned that its parent company, the SCL Group, was shuttering the business, with American-based workers directed to return their keycards immediately, according to documentation reviewed by Gizmodo. 
 
 The news was announced during a conference call led by Julian Wheatland, the current chairman of the SCL Group who was reportedly tapped to take over as Cambridge Analytica’s next CEO. Both Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections (the SCL Group subsidiary connected to Cambridge Analytica) will now close their doors.

 During the call, Wheatland said that the board determined that rebranding the company’s offerings in the current environment is “futile.” 
 
 Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group have offices in London, New York City, Arlington, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. The conference call was originally scheduled for Tuesday morning, but was repeatedly pushed back until early Wednesday afternoon, ultimately getting rescheduled more than half a dozen times. 
 
 Screenshots from the company’s internal chat service obtained by Gizmodo show a darkly comic mood in anticipation of the call. One employee shared bleakly titled Spotify playlists in Slack featuring songs like “High and Dry” by Radiohead, “The End” by The Doors, and “Help!” by The Beatles. Another employee posted a still from Titanic showing the ship’s band playing their instruments as the vessel sinks.

 In explaining the decision to close the offices, Wheatland cited the ongoing investigations into Cambridge Analytica’s massive data harvesting scandal, damage to the company’s reputation, and loss of clients. In March, Britain’s information commissioner announced that she was seeking a warrant to investigate any misconduct by the data analytics firm, looking to search both its offices and its servers. UK authorities raided the London office later that month, but have yet to release their findings. Meanwhile, embattled former CEO Alexander Nix refused to testify before the British Parliamentary media committee regarding the firm’s misuse of Facebook user data. 
 
 We have reached out to Cambridge Analytica for more information and will update this story if we hear back. 
 
 Update 2:10pm: Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed that both Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group are shutting down.

 Update 3:10pm: In a press release, Cambridge Analytica announced that it, SCL Elections, and other affiliate companies have filed for insolvency in the UK, with bankruptcy proceedings in the US to follow. 
 
 “Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by [a third-party audit], the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,” states the release. “As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.” 
 
 Update 4:56pm: Asked for clarification, The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Oakes said the entire SCL Group—not just subsidiary SCL Elections—was shutting down. We have updated our story to reflect this information

4,"The N.S.A.’s Evolution: The National Security Agency was founded in 1952, and its surveillance capabilities were limited by legislation in 1978. But with the attacks of September 2001 came a new sense of urgency. 
 
 When Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, sat down with President Obama at the White House in April to discuss Syrian chemical weapons, Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and climate change , it was a cordial, routine exchange. 
 
 The National Security Agency nonetheless went to work in advance and intercepted Mr. Ban’s talking points for the meeting, a feat the agency later reported as an “operational highlight” in a weekly internal brag sheet. It is hard to imagine what edge this could have given Mr. Obama in a friendly chat, if he even saw the N.S.A.’s modest scoop. (The White House won’t say.) 
 
 But it was emblematic of an agency that for decades has operated on the principle that any eavesdropping that can be done on a foreign target of any conceivable interest — now or in the future — should be done. After all, American intelligence officials reasoned, who’s going to find out? 
 
 From thousands of classified documents, the National Security Agency emerges as an electronic omnivore of staggering capabilities, eavesdropping and hacking its way around the world to strip governments and other targets of their secrets, all the while enforcing the utmost secrecy about its own operations. It spies routinely on friends as well as foes, as has become obvious in recent weeks; the agency’s official mission list includes using its surveillance powers to achieve “diplomatic advantage” over such allies as France and Germany and “economic advantage” over Japan and Brazil, among other countries. 
 
 Mr. Obama found himself in September standing uncomfortably beside the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who was furious at being named as a target of N.S.A. eavesdropping. Since then, there has been a parade of such protests, from the European Union, Mexico, France, Germany and Spain. Chagrined American officials joke that soon there will be complaints from foreign leaders feeling slighted because the agency had not targeted them. 
 
 James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, has repeatedly dismissed such objections as brazen hypocrisy from countries that do their own share of spying. But in a recent interview, he acknowledged that the scale of eavesdropping by the N.S.A., with 35,000 workers and $10.8 billion a year, sets it apart. “There’s no question that from a capability standpoint we probably dwarf everybody on the planet, just about, with perhaps the exception of Russia and China,” he said. 
 
 Since Edward J. Snowden began releasing the agency’s documents in June, the unrelenting stream of disclosures has opened the most extended debate on the agency’s mission since its creation in 1952. The scrutiny has ignited a crisis of purpose and legitimacy for the N.S.A., the nation’s largest intelligence agency, and the White House has ordered a review of both its domestic and its foreign intelligence collection. While much of the focus has been on whether the agency violates Americans’ privacy, an issue under examination by Congress and two review panels, the anger expressed around the world about American surveillance has prompted far broader questions. 
 
 If secrecy can no longer be taken for granted, when does the political risk of eavesdropping overseas outweigh its intelligence benefits? Should foreign citizens, many of whom now rely on American companies for email and Internet services, have any privacy protections from the N.S.A.? Will the American Internet giants’ collaboration with the agency, voluntary or otherwise, damage them in international markets? And are the agency’s clandestine efforts to weaken encryption making the Internet less secure for everyone? 
 
 Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian and author of a 2009 book on the N.S.A., said there is no precedent for the hostile questions coming at the agency from all directions. 
 
 “From N.S.A.’s point of view, it’s a disaster,” Mr. Aid said. “Every new disclosure reinforces the notion that the agency needs to be reined in. There are political consequences, and there will be operational consequences.” 
 
 A review of classified agency documents obtained by Mr. Snowden and shared with The New York Times by The Guardian, offers a rich sampling of the agency’s global operations and culture. (At the agency’s request, The Times is withholding some details that officials said could compromise intelligence operations.) The N.S.A. seems to be listening everywhere in the world, gathering every stray electron that might add, however minutely, to the United States government’s knowledge of the world. To some Americans, that may be a comfort. To others, and to people overseas, that may suggest an agency out of control. ||||| Mr. Obama found himself in September standing uncomfortably beside the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who was furious at being named as a target of N.S.A. eavesdropping.

 The C.I.A. dispatches undercover officers overseas to gather intelligence today roughly the same way spies operated in biblical times. But the N.S.A., born when the long-distance call was a bit exotic, has seen its potential targets explode in number with the advent of personal computers, the Internet and cellphones. Today’s N.S.A. is the Amazon of intelligence agencies, as different from the 1950s agency as that online behemoth is from a mom-and-pop bookstore. It sucks the contents from fiber-optic cables, sits on telephone switches and Internet hubs, digitally burglarizes laptops and plants bugs on smartphones around the globe. 
 
 Mr. Obama and top intelligence officials have defended the agency’s role in preventing terrorist attacks. But as the documents make clear, the focus on counterterrorism is a misleadingly narrow sales pitch for an agency with an almost unlimited agenda. Its scale and aggressiveness are breathtaking.

 The agency’s Dishfire database — nothing happens without a code word at the N.S.A. — stores years of text messages from around the world, just in case. Its Tracfin collection accumulates gigabytes of credit card purchases. The fellow pretending to send a text message at an Internet cafe in Jordan may be using an N.S.A. technique code-named Polarbreeze to tap into nearby computers. The Russian businessman who is socially active on the web might just become food for Snacks, the acronym-mad agency’s Social Network Analysis Collaboration Knowledge Services, which figures out the personnel hierarchies of organizations from texts.

 The spy agency’s station in Texas intercepted 478 emails while helping to foil a jihadist plot to kill a Swedish artist who had drawn pictures of the Prophet Muhammad. N.S.A. analysts delivered to authorities at Kennedy International Airport the names and flight numbers of workers dispatched by a Chinese human smuggling ring. 
 
 The agency’s eavesdropping gear, aboard a Defense Department plane flying 60,000 feet over Colombia, fed the location and plans of FARC rebels to the Colombian Army. In the Orlandocard operation, N.S.A. technicians set up what they called a “honeypot” computer on the web that attracted visits from 77,413 foreign computers and planted spyware on more than 1,000 that the agency deemed of potential future interest.

 The Global Phone Book 
 
 No investment seems too great if it adds to the agency’s global phone book. After mounting a major eavesdropping effort focused on a climate change conference in Bali in 2007, agency analysts stationed in Australia’s outback were especially thrilled by one catch: the cellphone number of Bali’s police chief. 
 
 “Our mission,” says the agency’s current five-year plan, which has not been officially scheduled for declassification until 2032, “is to answer questions about threatening activities that others mean to keep hidden.”

 The aspirations are grandiose: to “utterly master” foreign intelligence carried on communications networks. The language is corporate: “Our business processes need to promote data-driven decision-making.” But the tone is also strikingly moralistic for a government bureaucracy. Perhaps to counter any notion that eavesdropping is a shady enterprise, signals intelligence, or Sigint, the term of art for electronic intercepts, is presented as the noblest of callings. 
 
 “Sigint professionals must hold the moral high ground, even as terrorists or dictators seek to exploit our freedoms,” the plan declares. “Some of our adversaries will say or do anything to advance their cause; we will not.”

 The N.S.A. documents taken by Mr. Snowden and shared with The Times, numbering in the thousands and mostly dating from 2007 to 2012, are part of a collection of about 50,000 items that focus mainly on its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters or G.C.H.Q.

 While far from comprehensive, the documents give a sense of the agency’s reach and abilities, from the Navy ships snapping up radio transmissions as they cruise off the coast of China, to the satellite dishes at Fort Meade in Maryland ingesting worldwide banking transactions, to the rooftops of 80 American embassies and consulates around the world from which the agency’s Special Collection Service aims its antennas.

 The agency and its many defenders among senior government officials who have relied on its top secret reports say it is crucial to American security and status in the world, pointing to terrorist plots disrupted, nuclear proliferation tracked and diplomats kept informed.

 But the documents released by Mr. Snowden sometimes also seem to underscore the limits of what even the most intensive intelligence collection can achieve by itself. Blanket N.S.A. eavesdropping in Afghanistan, described in the documents as covering government offices and the hide-outs of second-tier Taliban militants alike, has failed to produce a clear victory against a low-tech enemy. The agency kept track as Syria amassed its arsenal of chemical weapons — but that knowledge did nothing to prevent the gruesome slaughter outside Damascus in August.

 The documents are skewed toward celebration of the agency’s self-described successes, as underlings brag in PowerPoints to their bosses about their triumphs and the managers lay out grand plans. But they do not entirely omit the agency’s flubs and foibles: flood tides of intelligence gathered at huge cost that goes unexamined; intercepts that cannot be read for lack of language skills; and computers that — even at the N.S.A. — go haywire in all the usual ways. 
 
 Mapping Message Trails 
 
 In May 2009, analysts at the agency learned that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was to make a rare trip to Kurdistan Province in the country’s mountainous northwest. The agency immediately organized a high-tech espionage mission, part of a continuing project focused on Ayatollah Khamenei called Operation Dreadnought.

 Working closely with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which handles satellite photography, as well as G.C.H.Q., the N.S.A. team studied the Iranian leader’s entourage, its vehicles and its weaponry from satellites, and intercepted air traffic messages as planes and helicopters took off and landed. 
 
 They heard Ayatollah Khamenei’s aides fretting about finding a crane to load an ambulance and fire truck onto trucks for the journey. They listened as he addressed a crowd, segregated by gender, in a soccer field. 
 
 They studied Iranian air defense radar stations and recorded the travelers’ rich communications trail, including Iranian satellite coordinates collected by an N.S.A. program called Ghosthunter. The point was not so much to catch the Iranian leader’s words, but to gather the data for blanket eavesdropping on Iran in the event of a crisis.

 This “communications fingerprinting,” as a document called it, is the key to what the N.S.A. does. It allows the agency’s computers to scan the stream of international communications and pluck out messages tied to the supreme leader. In a crisis — say, a showdown over Iran’s nuclear program — the ability to tap into the communications of leaders, generals and scientists might give a crucial advantage.

 On a more modest scale, the same kind of effort, what N.S.A. calls “Sigint development,” was captured in a document the agency obtained in 2009 from Somalia — whether from a human source or an electronic break-in was not noted. It contained email addresses and other contact details for 117 selected customers of a Mogadishu Internet service, Globalsom. 
 
 While most on the list were Somali officials or citizens, presumably including some suspected of militancy, the document also included emails for a United Nations political officer in Mogadishu and a local representative for the charity World Vision, among other international institutions. All, it appeared, were considered fair game for monitoring.

 This huge investment in collection is driven by pressure from the agency’s “customers,” in government jargon, not only at the White House, Pentagon, F.B.I. and C.I.A., but also spread across the Departments of State and Energy, Homeland Security and Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative.

 By many accounts, the agency provides more than half of the intelligence nuggets delivered to the White House early each morning in the President’s Daily Brief — a measure of success for American spies. (One document boasts that listening in on Nigerian State Security had provided items for the briefing “nearly two dozen” times.) In every international crisis, American policy makers look to the N.S.A. for inside information.

 Pressure to Get Everything 
 
 That creates intense pressure not to miss anything. When that is combined with an ample budget and near-invisibility to the public, the result is aggressive surveillance of the kind that has sometimes gotten the agency in trouble with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a United States federal court that polices its programs for breaches of Americans’ privacy. 
 
 In the funding boom that followed the Sept. 11 attacks, the agency expanded and decentralized far beyond its Fort Meade headquarters in Maryland, building or expanding major facilities in Georgia, Texas, Colorado, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington State and Utah. Its officers also operate out of major overseas stations in England, Australia, South Korea and Japan, at overseas military bases, and from locked rooms housing the Special Collection Service inside American missions abroad. 
 
 The agency, using a combination of jawboning, stealth and legal force, has turned the nation’s Internet and telecommunications companies into collection partners, installing filters in their facilities, serving them with court orders, building back doors into their software and acquiring keys to break their encryption.

 But even that vast American-run web is only part of the story. For decades, the N.S.A. has shared eavesdropping duties with the rest of the so-called Five Eyes, the Sigint agencies of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. More limited cooperation occurs with many more countries, including formal arrangements called Nine Eyes and 14 Eyes and Nacsi, an alliance of the agencies of 26 NATO countries.

 The extent of Sigint sharing can be surprising: “N.S.A. may pursue a relationship with Vietnam,” one 2009 G.C.H.Q. document reported. But a recent G.C.H.Q. training document suggests that not everything is shared, even between the United States and Britain. “Economic well-being reporting,” it says, referring to intelligence gathered to aid the British economy, “cannot be shared with any foreign partner.” 
 
 As at the school lunch table, decisions on who gets left out can cause hurt feelings: “Germans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-Eyes group,” one 2009 document remarks. And in a delicate spy-versus-spy dance, sharing takes place even with governments that are themselves important N.S.A. targets, notably Israel.

 The documents describe collaboration with the Israel Sigint National Unit, which gets raw N.S.A. eavesdropping material and provides it in return, but they also mention the agency’s tracking of “high priority Israeli military targets,” including drone aircraft and the Black Sparrow missile system.

 The alliances, and the need for stealth, can get complicated. At one highly valued overseas listening post, the very presence of American N.S.A. personnel violates a treaty agreed to by the agency’s foreign host. Even though much of the eavesdropping is run remotely from N.S.A.’s base at Fort Gordon, Ga., Americans who visit the site must pose as contractors, carry fake business cards and are warned: “Don’t dress as typical Americans."" 
 
 “Know your cover legend,” a PowerPoint security briefing admonishes the N.S.A. staff members headed to the overseas station, directing them to “sanitize personal effects,” send no postcards home and buy no identifiably local souvenirs. (“An option might be jewelry. Most jewelry does not have any markings” showing its place of origin.)

 Bypassing Security 
 
 In the agency’s early years, its brainy staff members — it remains the largest employer of mathematicians in the country — played an important role in the development of the first computers, then largely a tool for code breaking.

 Today, with personal computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones in most homes and government offices in the developed world, hacking has become the agency’s growth area.

 Some of Mr. Snowden’s documents describe the exploits of Tailored Access Operations, the prim name for the N.S.A. division that breaks into computers around the world to steal the data inside, and sometimes to leave spy software behind. T.A.O. is increasingly important in part because it allows the agency to bypass encryption by capturing messages as they are written or read, when they are not encoded.

 In Baghdad, T.A.O. collected messages left in draft form in email accounts maintained by leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq, a militant group. Under a program called Spinaltap, the division’s hackers identified 24 unique Internet Protocol addresses identifying computers used by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, making it possible to snatch Hezbollah messages from the flood of global communications sifted by the agency. 
 
 The N.S.A.’s elite Transgression Branch, created in 2009 to “discover, understand, evaluate and exploit” foreign hackers’ work, quietly piggybacks on others’ incursions into computers of interest, like thieves who follow other housebreakers around and go through the windows they have left ajar. 
 
 In one 2010 hacking operation code-named Ironavenger, for instance, the N.S.A. spied simultaneously on an ally and an adversary. Analysts spotted suspicious emails being sent to a government office of great intelligence interest in a hostile country and realized that an American ally was “spear-phishing” — sending official-looking emails that, when opened, planted malware that let hackers inside.

 The Americans silently followed the foreign hackers, collecting documents and passwords from computers in the hostile country, an elusive target. They got a look inside that government and simultaneously got a close-up look at the ally’s cyberskills, the kind of intelligence twofer that is the unit’s specialty. 
 
 In many other ways, advances in computer and communications technology have been a boon for the agency. N.S.A. analysts tracked the electronic trail left by a top leader of Al Qaeda in Africa each time he stopped to use a computer on his travels. They correctly predicted his next stop, and the police were there to arrest him.

 And at the big N.S.A. station at Fort Gordon, technicians developed an automated service called “Where’s My Node?” that sent an email to an analyst every time a target overseas moved from one cell tower to another. Without lifting a finger, an analyst could follow his quarry’s every move.

 The Limits of Spying 
 
 The techniques described in the Snowden documents can make the N.S.A. seem omniscient, and nowhere in the world is that impression stronger than in Afghanistan. But the agency’s capabilities at the tactical level have not been nearly enough to produce clear-cut strategic success there, in the United States’ longest war. 
 
 A single daily report from June 2011 from the N.S.A.’s station in Kandahar, Afghanistan, the heart of Taliban country, illustrates the intensity of eavesdropping coverage, requiring 15 pages to describe a day’s work.

 The agency listened while insurgents from the Haqqani network mounted an attack on the Hotel Intercontinental in Kabul, overhearing the attackers talking to their bosses in Pakistan’s tribal area and recording events minute by minute. “Ruhullah claimed he was on the third floor and had already inflicted one casualty,” the report said in a typical entry. “He also indicated that Hafiz was located on a different floor.”

 N.S.A. officers listened as two Afghan Foreign Ministry officials prepared for a meeting between President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Iranian officials, assuring them that relations with the United States “would in no way threaten the interests of Iran,” which they decided Mr. Karzai should describe as a “brotherly country.” 
 
 The N.S.A. eavesdropped as the top United Nations official in Afghanistan, Staffan de Mistura, consulted his European Union counterpart, Vygaudas Usackas, about how to respond to an Afghan court’s decision to overturn the election of 62 members of Parliament.

 And the agency was a fly on the wall for a long-running land dispute between the mayor of Kandahar and a prominent local man known as the Keeper of the Cloak of the Prophet Muhammad, with President Karzai’s late brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, as a mediator. 
 
 The agency discovered a Taliban claim to have killed five police officers at a checkpoint by giving them poisoned yogurt, and heard a provincial governor tell an aide that a district police chief was verbally abusing women and clergymen.

 A Taliban figure, Mullah Rahimullah Akhund, known on the United States military’s kill-or-capture list by the code name Objective Squiz Incinerator, was overheard instructing an associate to buy suicide vests and a Japanese motorbike, according to the documents. 
 
 And N.S.A. listened in as a Saudi extremist, Abu Mughira, called his mother to report that he and his fellow fighters had entered Afghanistan and “done victorious operations.” 
 
 Such reports flowed from the agency’s Kandahar station day after day, year after year, and surely strengthened the American campaign against the Taliban. But they also suggest the limits of intelligence against a complex political and military challenge. The N.S.A. recorded the hotel attack, but it had not prevented it. It tracked Mr. Karzai’s government, but he remained a difficult and volatile partner. Its surveillance was crucial in the capture or killing of many enemy fighters, but not nearly enough to remove the Taliban’s ominous shadow from Afghanistan’s future.

 Mining All the Tidbits 
 
 In the Afghan reports and many others, a striking paradox is the odd intimacy of a sprawling, technology-driven agency with its targets. It is the one-way intimacy of the eavesdropper, as N.S.A. employees virtually enter the office cubicles of obscure government officials and the Spartan hide-outs of drug traffickers and militants around the world.

 Venezuela, for instance, was one of six “enduring targets” in N.S.A.’s official mission list from 2007, along with China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Russia. The United States viewed itself in a contest for influence in Latin America with Venezuela’s leader then, the leftist firebrand Hugo Chávez, who allied himself with Cuba, and one agency goal was “preventing Venezuela from achieving its regional leadership objectives and pursuing policies that negatively impact U.S. global interests.” 
 
 A glimpse of what this meant in practice comes in a brief PowerPoint presentation from August 2010 on “Development of the Venezuelan Economic Mission.” The N.S.A. was tracking billions of dollars flowing to Caracas in loans from China (radar systems and oil drilling), Russia (MIG fighter planes and shoulder-fired missiles) and Iran (a factory to manufacture drone aircraft).

 But it was also getting up-close and personal with Venezuela’s Ministry of Planning and Finance, monitoring the government and personal emails of the top 10 Venezuelan economic officials. An N.S.A. officer in Texas, in other words, was paid each day to peruse the private messages of obscure Venezuelan bureaucrats, hunting for tidbits that might offer some tiny policy edge.

 In a counterdrug operation in late 2011, the agency’s officers seemed to know more about relations within a sprawling narcotics network than the drug dealers themselves. They listened to “Ricketts,” a Jamaican drug supplier based in Ecuador, struggling to keep his cocaine and marijuana smuggling business going after an associate, “Gordo,” claimed he had paid $250,000 and received nothing in return.

 The N.S.A., a report said, was on top of not just their cellphones, but also those of the whole network of “buyers, transporters, suppliers, and middlemen” stretching from the Netherlands and Nova Scotia to Panama City and Bogotá, Colombia. The documents do not say whether arrests resulted from all that eavesdropping. 
 
 Even with terrorists, N.S.A. units can form a strangely personal relationship. The N.S.A.-G.C.H.Q. wiki, a top secret group blog that Mr. Snowden downloaded, lists 14 specialists scattered in various stations assigned to Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani terrorist group that carried out the bloody attack on Mumbai in 2008, with titles including “Pakistan Access Pursuit Team” and “Techniques Discovery Branch.” Under the code name Treaclebeta, N.S.A.’s hackers at Tailored Access Operations also played a role.

 In the wiki’s casual atmosphere, American and British eavesdroppers exchange the peculiar shoptalk of the secret world. “I don’t normally use Heretic to scan the fax traffic, I use Nucleon,” one user writes, describing technical tools for searching intercepted documents.

 But most striking are the one-on-one pairings of spies and militants; Bryan is assigned to listen in on a man named Haroon, and Paul keeps an ear on Fazl. 
 
 A Flood of Details 
 
 One N.S.A. officer on the Lashkar-e-Taiba beat let slip that some of his eavesdropping turned out to be largely pointless, perhaps because of the agency’s chronic shortage of skilled linguists. He “ran some queries” to read intercepted communications of certain Lashkar-e-Taiba members, he wrote in the wiki, but added: “Most of it is in Arabic or Farsi, so I can’t make much of it.” 
 
 It is a glimpse of the unsurprising fact that sometimes the agency’s expensive and expansive efforts accomplish little. Despite the agency’s embrace of corporate jargon on goal-setting and evaluation, it operates without public oversight in an arena in which achievements are hard to measure.

 In a world of ballooning communications, the agency is sometimes simply overwhelmed. In 2008, the N.S.A.’s Middle East and North Africa group set about updating its Sigint collection capabilities. The “ambitious scrub” of selectors — essentially search terms — cut the number of terms automatically searched from 21,177 to 7,795 and the number of messages added to the agency’s Pinwale database from 850,000 a day to 450,000 a day. 
 
 The reduction in volume was treated as a major achievement, opening the way for new collection on Iranian leadership and Saudi and Syrian diplomats, the report said. 
 
 Advertisement Continue reading the main story 
 
 And in a note that may comfort computer novices, the N.S.A. Middle East analysts discovered major glitches in their search software: The computer was searching for the names of targets but not their email addresses, a rather fundamental flaw. “Over 500 messages in one week did not come in,” the report said about one target. 
 
 Those are daily course corrections. Whether the Snowden disclosures will result in deeper change is uncertain. Joel F. Brenner, the agency’s former inspector general, says much of the criticism is unfair, reflecting a naïveté about the realpolitik of spying. “The agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it’s supposed to do,” he said. 
 
 But Mr. Brenner added that he believes “technology has outrun policy” at the N.S.A., and that in an era in which spying may well be exposed, “routine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish.” 
 
 Another former insider worries less about foreign leaders’ sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home. William E. Binney, a former senior N.S.A. official who has become an outspoken critic, says he has no problem with spying on foreign targets like Brazil’s president or the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “That’s pretty much what every government does,” he said. “It’s the foundation of diplomacy.” But Mr. Binney said that without new leadership, new laws and top-to-bottom reform, the agency will represent a threat of “turnkey totalitarianism” — the capability to turn its awesome power, now directed mainly against other countries, on the American public.

 “I think it’s already starting to happen,” he said. “That’s what we have to stop.” 
 
 Whatever reforms may come, Bobby R.

 The discovery could put south-central Kansas on the map as the second-biggest settlement of Native Americans found in the United States, Blakeslee said. And it’s now, finally, the known location of a 1601 battle pitting outnumbered Spaniards firing cannon into waves of attacking Indian warriors.

 Etzanoa has remained a mystery for 400 years. Archaeologists could not find it. Historians thought reports of a permanent settlement with 20,000 Native Americans in it were exaggerated. 
 
 But here in Arkansas City, at the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers, Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeologist at Wichita State University, has found evidence of a massive town stretching across thousands of acres of bluffs and rich bottomland along two rivers. What clinched it was the discovery, by a high school kid, of a half-inch iron cannon ball. 
 
 He even found a still-functional water shrine, depicting communication with the spirit world, carved into a limestone boulder in Tami and Greg Norwood’s backyard. 
 
 It’s a good story, all true, Blakeslee said: A lost city, a forgotten mythology — and the story of the once-great Wichita Nation, decimated by European diseases, then pushed aside by American settlers and the United States Army. 
 
 Amazed by the size 
 
 With the discovery, Arkansas City leaders are hoping to turn their town into a tourist destination. 
 
 “We always knew we once had a whole bunch of Indians living around here, because we had found way too many artifacts to think otherwise,” said Jay Warren, an Arkansas City council member. “But we had no idea until Dr. Blakeslee came along about how big it was.” 
 
 Etzanoa might have been comparable in size to Cahokia, Blakeslee said. That alone should bring world attention. 
 
 The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in western Illinois, with its pyramid Monk’s Mound, is the biggest Native American urban complex ever built in the United States. It showcases the 14.4-acre mound that was the centerpiece of the ancient city, along with the outlines of the city, enclosed by fortress walls and filled with shrines of a powerful mythology and culture outside St. Louis. 
 
 Cahokia — the remnants of the largest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico — attracts 400,000 visitors a year, a fact that gets the attention of Arkansas Citians. If Etzanoa was bigger, “and it might have been,” that will rewrite American history, Blakeslee said. 
 
 “The Spaniards were amazed by the size of Etzanoa,” Blakeslee said. “They counted 2,000 houses that could hold 10 people each. They said it would take two or three days to walk through it all.” 
 
 But for four centuries, the story of a big Native American town in Kansas made no sense to historians. 
 
 When French explorers came in the 1700s, 100 years after the Spanish battle, they met only migratory bands of Kanza, Wichita, Pawnee, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Apache tribes. 
 
 So historians read the Spanish accounts and raised questions: If there were a permanent mega-site named Etzanoa, where was the huge accumulation of pottery shards? 
 
 And where did those tens of thousands of people go? Twenty thousand, as the Spaniards estimated in 1601, is equivalent to modern-day Derby, Liberal or Hays. 
 
 And how could Plains hunters feed tens of thousands day after day? Bison are dangerous. The Wichita had no horses and hunted on foot. 
 
 And where were the Spanish cannonballs, fired by outnumbered and terrified Spaniards? 
 
 The battle 
 
 For years, Blakeslee, 73, had read the accounts of soldiers who served under the Conquistador Juan de Onate, the founding governor of the colony of New Mexico. Onate’s soldiers said they fought a battle 60 years after Coronado, somewhere in the Great Plains. 
 
 The battle reports said Onate led 70 soldiers from New Mexico and found a vast town at the junction of two rivers. 
 
 Warriors on the outskirts threw dirt into the air as the Spanish approached, signaling they were ready to fight. “The Rayados,” Onate called the Wichitas — “The striped ones,” from the way they painted and tattooed their faces. 
 
 The Spaniards entered the town, and the Wichita fled, thousands evacuating to the north. 
 
 Onate sent armed patrols into the empty town. 
 
 What his soldiers saw unnerved them. They told Onate they’d counted 2,000 big beehive-shaped homes — clusters of these homes surrounded by cornfields. Nervous about the size of the place, they turned around. Indians told them later that the settlement extended for miles past where the Spaniards stopped, meaning the true population might have been higher than the 20,000 Spanish estimate. 
 
 Onate turned his men south — and came face to face with hundreds of warriors, firing arrows and charging at Onate’s small Spanish troop. 
 
 The attackers were Escanxaques, a tribe enemy to the Wichita. They had come to attack Etzanoa — and now attacked the Spanish. 
 
 Sixty of the 70 Spaniards were wounded. Their four cannons saved them, clusters of iron bullets fired from cannon-like shotgun blasts, whistling into trees and boulders. The Escanxaques, stunned, regrouped in a rock-lined ravine, but then charged repeatedly uphill to attack before finally backing off. 
 
 Cannonballs confirm 
 
 It was a high school kid, Adam Ziegler, who made the link that cinched the verification of Etzanoa. 
 
 Blakeslee says artifacts he and Ziegler found in the past two years show the old stories were true, and that between the years 1450 and 1700, at least 20,000 ancestors of today’s Wichita Nation thrived in and near what is now Arkansas City. 
 
 Blakeslee realized the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas rivers could be the one described by the Spanish. He found traces of houses and granaries. He’s walked over much of Arkansas City and saw that the ravines and bluffs fit the Spanish accounts. 
 
 After locals like Hap McCleod told him people had been digging up “literally tons” of flint tools and clay pottery shards for generations, Blakeslee dug up his own shards, flint arrowheads, knife blades, hide-scrapers and awls. 
 
 Two years ago he found a rock-lined ravine in McLeod’s backyard that matched the Spanish account of where the Escanxaques regrouped under fire to attack. He took a metal detector there, along with Ziegler, a Lawrence Free-State High School freshman. 
 
 “They couldn’t find anything that day,” Ziegler recalled. “Dr. Blakeslee said I could use his metal detector. An hour or two later, I found the little ball, buried four inches deep.” 
 
 Blakeslee found two more Spanish cannonballs. 
 
 That did it, Blakeslee said. The old story was true. 
 
 Tough beyond belief 
 
 Blakeslee says the Wichita were wronged by fate, disease epidemics and war. He’s going to try to set right what he can. 
 
 Smallpox and other illnesses killed probably tens of thousands after 1600, he said. 
 
 War and relocation forced survivors to Oklahoma reservations. The tribe lost most of its culture. The tribe’s last fluent speaker of the Wichita language, Doris McLemore, died last year. 
 
 The Wichita were organized, cultured — “and tough almost beyond belief,” he said. 
 
 They and their Wichita cousins in Quivira, in Rice County, built a trade network with ancestors of the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico. They strapped 50-pound packages of dried meat and hides to themselves and their pack dogs, and walked 550 miles to the Pueblos. They’d then walk back, bringing home cotton fabric, obsidian and turquoise. 
 
 They had no horses. The women and children likely helped hunt bison, Blakeslee said, forming lines and waving hide blankets while driving bison toward warriors carrying bows and arrows. “Think of the courage that took,” Blakeslee said. 
 
 They cultivated beans, maize (corn), pumpkin and squash. They slaughtered bison meat and hides on an industrial scale. The men likely scouted, walking miles a day, shadowing herds. The women used flint hide-scrapers to thin down bison hides. “From doing that all day, they probably had the toughest fists,” Blakeslee said. “You’d never want to get in a fistfight with a Wichita woman.” 
 
 Intrigue, concern 
 
 Modern-day Wichitas number about 3,000, based now in Anadarko, Okla., said Gary McAdams, who has held several leadership positions with the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. 
 
 The Wichita are intrigued — and concerned — by what might come next, McAdams said. Blakeslee has consulted with them for years, telling what he’s found, inviting them to visit sites at Arkansas City and at the 160-foot-long serpent symbol still visible in the pasture grass in Rice County. Wichitas have helped on some of his digs. 
 
 “We would have some concern about how they go about developing their thinking about Etzanoa as a tourist center,” McAdams said. “We are supportive of any respectful endeavor they want to pursue there — but would want to provide our input.” 
 
 Jay Warren, a city council member, says the town will explore development. 
 
 Cahokia, in Illinois, attracts 400,000 visitors a year, but mostly because of how striking the 100-foot-tall Monk’s Mound looks, and because it’s located next to St. Louis and Interstate 70. 
 
 Arkansas City, in contrast, has pastureland. 
 
 But Civil War battlefields don’t have a Monk’s Mound either, Warren said. “And yet they attract thousands of visitors by doing a great job with walking trails and signs that explain step-by-step what was going on.” 
 
 If Arkansas City with its 12,000 people could attract 20,000 students, archaeologists and tourists a year, it would give the city a boost, said McLeod, in whose backyard Adam Ziegler found that cannonball. McLeod now runs the Etzanoa Conservancy, and has worked for two years to polish ideas. “We’re really proud that all this history happened here, and we want to share it with the world,” he said. 
 
 “We’re not talking about putting together a one-day wonder,” Warren said. “We’re looking at creating something that could be great for the region, and for 50 years and more down the road. We’re talking with (Unified School District) 470 about how it could enhance education. And we think the site could also be a hands-on field training facility for archaeologists from all over the world.” 
 
 They could build an interactive visitor center, he said. They could build reconstructions of the grass houses and granaries the Wichita used. They could employ flint-knappers who could show how skilled craftsmen made arrowheads and knife blades. 
 
 Etzanoa would have been beautiful, McLeod said. The river bluffs south of Arkansas City look like picture postcards. The bluffs and hills pour out clear spring water from dells and nooks. 
 
 McLeod drove up recently to the tallest point in Arkansas City — where the city’s golf course clubhouse sits. 
 
 Blakeslee had told him that’s where Caratax, the Wichita chief in 1601, probably kept his home. 
 
 “You can see 360 degrees in any direction from here,” McLeod said. 
 
 “And it’s all beautiful.” ||||| Volunteer Adam Ziegler found an iron ball while volunteering to help archaeologists uncover remnants of a Native American settlement east of Arkansas City, Kan., in June. The ball was fired by a Spanish cannon at ancestors of the Wichita tribe, who ambushed an expedition led by Don Juan de Onate in 1601, according to Don Blakeslee, an archaeologist who led a study of the site. FOSS FARRAR Arkansas City Traveler ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Donald Blakeslee, professor of archaeology at Wichita State University, presented in March at the annual conference of the Society for American Archaeology discussing recent archaeological evidence that shows a thriving ancestral Wichita Indian town of more than 20,000 residents near Arkansas City, Kansas. 
 
 The discovery began with new translations of old Spanish documents by the Cibola Project at the University of California, Berkley. Members of the team made photocopies of the original documents, re-transcribed them from the Old Spanish and then retranslated them. Earlier historians and archaeologists who had used the documents dealt with misleading errors in transcription and translation, which is why many archaeological discoveries in the area were misinterpreted. 
 
 “It has been a lot of fun to rewrite the record so thoroughly. By joining the historical written record to the archaeology, we ended up rewriting both fields,” says Blakeslee. “Rather than a cluster of 30 little villages, there was a single town of 20,000 people.” 
 
 Research of the town, called Etzanoa, has completely revised the understanding of protohistoric settlements in the southern plains. Previous scholars often dismissed the Spanish population estimates as exaggerations, but with the evidence of the archaeological finds it can no longer be dismissed. 
 
 “One implication is that Old World epidemic diseases had not yet reached this region, but probably did so by around 1650, because there were far fewer Wichitas when the French arrived in 1718,” says Blakeslee. 
 
 Blakeslee reported archaeology that coincides with eyewitness accounts from five soldiers of Spanish explorer and founder of New Mexico, Juan de Oñate, who were interviewed in Mexico City in 1602. 
 
 Scattered surface finds match the description of the town as extending about five miles, and the description of the landscape and route of the Spanish army also line up. The biggest piece of confirmation came with the discovery of the site of a battle fought there in 1601. Metal detectors were used to uncover small iron shot from in front of the ravine where natives took shelter and well beyond it where shots eventually fell. 
 
 Blakeslee began work at the site in 2015 when he invited leaders of the Wichita tribe to visit and spent a week there researching. He’s been able to involve WSU students with the research as well and has taken them to the site each summer since. They plan to be there for four weeks during summer 2017. 
 
 “Work at Etzanoa will continue for the rest of my career and beyond,” says Blakeslee. “It will be an important part of WSU’s future.”","– Don Juan de Oñate sought a city of gold when he explored what are now the Plains states. It wasn't to be, but according to an interview given by five of his men in 1602, they did find something staggering: a ""great settlement"" some five miles long that housed at least 20,000 people, an ancestral Wichita Indian town called Etzanoa. But French explorers in the region 100 years later found no sign of those people, sowing confusion among latter-day historians. Donald Blakeslee, an archaeologist with Wichita State University, says he's cleared it all up: Etzanoa did exist, he claims, once thriving where the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers meet in Arkansas City, Kansas. Per a university press release, things got off the ground with a new and more correct transcription of centuries-old Spanish documents by the University of California, Berkeley's Cibola Project. Prior translation errors caused ""many archaeological discoveries in the area [to be] misinterpreted,"" per the release. In 2015, Blakeslee noted that a geographic description of a 1601 ambush described in a Spanish account had to have occurred where the rivers joined. And, indeed, a search there turned up small iron cannon balls, reported the Kansas City Star at the time. If Blakeslee is right, the ""long-lost city"" would be second only to Cahokia on the list of biggest prehistoric Native American sites, reports the Wichita Eagle. That would be a boon for Arkansas City and its 12,000 residents; some 400,000 flock to the remains of Cahokia, in Illinois, each year. The Kansas House of Representatives thinks Blakeslee is onto something; earlier this month it approved a resolution that formally recognizes Etzanoa based on ""the evidence,"" reports the Courier Traveler. (This man followed a hunch, says he uncovered a lost city.)","<pad> – The discovery of Etzanoa, a long-lost city in Kansas, is a big step forward for the Wichita Nation.

6,"Rep. Anthony Weiner rejected Democratic leaders’ private and public calls for his resignation Saturday, choosing instead to take a leave of absence from the House to seek professional treatment amid an online sex scandal that the head of the party called a “sordid affair.” 
 
 Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-Fla.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, turned on Weiner the day after it was revealed he had contacted a 17-year-old Delaware girl through social media. Though Weiner, Delaware police and the girl’s family say there was nothing indecent in the back-and-forth, the development added intrigue to the New York Democrat’s confession on Monday that he sent sexually charged text messages and photographs to six women over the past three years.

 reset VIDEO: Weiner’s teary presser POLITICO 44 
 
 For now, his vow to remain in office stands, but he didn’t appear dug in: He left open the possibility, for the first time, of leaving, with a statement that suggested he needs to be in a better mental position to make a decision about his future. 
 
 “Congressman Weiner departed this morning to seek professional treatment to focus on becoming a better husband and healthier person,” Weiner’s office said in a statement provided to POLITICO. “In light of that, he will request a short leave of absence from the House of Representatives so that he can get evaluated and map out a course of treatment to make himself well. Congressman Weiner takes the views of his colleagues very seriously and has determined that he needs this time to get healthy and make the best decision possible for himself, his family and his constituents.” 
 
 But the mass abandonment from party leaders means Weiner will go it alone if, after reflection and treatment, he believes he can salvage a once-promising career in which he used bombastic floor speeches, frequent cable television appearances and, ironically, an understanding of the power of social media to become an icon for national progressives. The story of Weiner’s political career hasn’t yet reached its conclusion, but the onetime protagonist is now cast as the antagonist. 
 
 The decision to seek treatment buys Weiner time, but the statement from his aides suggests he might still quit rather than return to Congress after his leave of absence. 
 
 Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the former DCCC chairman and top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, added his name to the list of Democratic officials who have called on Weiner to resign. “Anthony Weiner’s repeated violation of the public trust is unacceptable,” Van Hollen said. “He can best advance the issues he fought for by resigning immediately.” 
 
 In addition to Wasserman Schultz, two former DNC chairmen, Ed Rendell and Tim Kaine, have said Weiner should step down, as have several of Weiner’s rank-and-file congressional colleagues. 
 
 However, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) both approved of Weiner’s decision to seek treatment and did not call for his resignation. 
 
 Schumer, Weiner’s former boss, said: “I am heartbroken. For those of us who are longtime friends of Anthony Weiner, his wrongful behavior is distressing and saddening. It’s clear he needs professional help, and I am glad he is seeking it.” 
 
 Gillibrand said: “My heart is with Anthony’s wife and family. My office will work to ensure all the constituents of the 9th congressional District are fully served during any leave of absence by Congressman Weiner.” 
 
 On Friday, FOX News reported that Wilmington-area police had visited a Delaware teenager to discuss Weiner’s electronic exchange with her. 
 
 Though Weiner and the girl’s family have told news outlets that there was no sex-related communication, the revelation that he carried on a discussion of any kind with a 17-year-old girl pumped more life into a scandal that has now spanned three weekends. ||||| Anthony Weiner takes out his dirty laundry, gets cheers from onlookers amid sext scandal

 Scandal-scarred Congressman Anthony Weiner took out his dirty laundry Saturday - and was roundly cheered by onlookers as he walked to his local dry cleaners. 
 
 
 
 The embattled lawmaker reiterated that he will not step down, even in light of revelations that he exchanged tweets with a 17-year-old girl. 
 
 
 
 ""I have no intention at this time,"" Weiner said outside his Queens home before walking to the laundromat. ""This is ultimately a decision for my constituents."" 
 
 Weiner has been the center of intense political speculation - and the butt of countless jokes - since he admitted to sending lewd online messages to at least six women.

 One of the recipients - a teenager in Delaware - is a minor and was interviewed by police Friday. She told cops that nothing inappropriate happened and no charges have been filed. 
 
 
 
 ""She has spoken,"" Weiner said. ""I think the record is pretty clear - nothing explicit, nothing indecent, nothing inappropriate."" 
 
 Weiner emerged from his Forest Hills home and strolled down Austin St. toward Smile Austin Cleaners, flanked by camera crews as he dropped off a load of laundry. 
 
 Two people yelled ""Don't go Weiner!"" while another shouted, ""We support you."" 
 
 
 
 The embattled Congressman briefly stopped to address the reporters following him during his short walk. 
 
 
 
 ""I've made some serious mistakes here but I'm going to try to get back to work,"" he said. ""These were personal failing. I'm going to try to redeem myself."" 
 
 Weiner's pregnant wife, Huma Abedin, is currently in Zambia, traveling with Secretary of State of Hillary Clinton. The lawmaker would not confirm that he spoke to Clinton or her husband to ask for forgiveness. 
 
 
 
 ""I've had some conversations with people,"" said Weiner, who refused to say more. 
 
 
 
 Weiner's political future remains unclear. Though many leaders of his own party have called for him to step down, he finally received some key support from Rep. Charlie Rangel Friday. 
 
 
 
 Rangel, who survived a tax scandal a year ago, insisted that Weiner had not done anything illegal and should not resign. 
 
 
 
 Recent polls show that Weiner, 46, still has the backing of the majority of his Queens-Brooklyn district - and heard some of that support during his six-minute walk.

7,"Augmented reality startup Magic Leap is being sued for sexual discrimination by an executive who was hired to help it appeal to women. 
 
 The company, a startup best known for securing a valuation in the billions despite never publicly demonstrating its technology, is being sued by Tannen Campbell, its former head of, and later vice-president of, strategic marketing and brand identity. 
 
 Campbell alleges that, in her first few months at Magic Leap, she was asked to put together a presentation to highlight the lack of gender diversity in the company. In her case, filed in the southern district court of Florida, she alleges it took seven months to get chief executive, Rony Abovitz, to attend the presentation, and when he did he left halfway through. Campbell never managed to present the second half. 
 
 A year later, another Magic Leap employee, Rachna Bhasin, was asked to head up what the filing describes as “a ‘female brain trust initiative’ – the ‘FBI’”. Bhasin, Campbell and five other women from the company were involved in the initial meeting, in May 2016, alongside Abovitz, the vice-president of product design, Gary Natsume, and “a couple of male members of his team”. 
 
 Campbell describes a “chaotic discussion”, in which a number of recommendations were made about a prototype design of Magic Leap’s hardware, “such as not having the headset connect in the back of the head because such a connection is difficult for people with ponytails or long hair”. None of the proposed changes were made to the design, and later meetings, which were not attended by any of the male members of the team, resulted in “no clear path forward”. 
 
 As well as presenting an image of a company where Campbell’s efforts to create a female-friendly workplace and product were coolly received, the suit also alleges more direct tolerance of sexist comments and attitudes. The suit alleges: 
 
 An image of two doctors, a man and a woman, prompted the comment “look, it’s Bring Your Wife to Work Day”. 
 
 One of the three or four core apps that will ship with Magic Leap’s headset “is a game, ‘Dr. G.,’ that has no female heroes or lead characters”. The one female character in the narrative, who isn’t in the game itself, “is a busty woman depicted on her knees grovelling at the heroes’ feet in admiration”. 
 
 A group for “magic leap spouses” which was explicitly targeted at “board [sic] wives at home” (the bracketed “[sic]” is in the court filing). 
 
 
 
 A new hire orientation included the unprepared advice: “in IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries”. Campbell was told the person in question would not be giving new hire orientations in the future as a result, but that did not happen. 
 
 
 
 Campbell alleges that events like those construe a hostile working environment, and is asking for punitive damages from Magic Leap. The company has not responded to a request for comment. 
 
 
 
 The lawsuit is the latest piece of bad news for Magic Leap, after a string of stories that began with a report in December 2016 that the company was struggling to incorporate the “dazzling” technology it had used to wow investors into the product it was planning to release.

 In February, it had to combat mockery after the first picture of its hardware leaked, showing a clunky prototype worn on a backpack. Abovitz responded by arguing that the picture showed “an R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work”. ||||| Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz Getty A newly filed lawsuit by a former Magic Leap VP alleges that the company is a hostile working place for women, a condition that has led to the company missing internal deadlines, according to the complaint. 
 
 Tannen Campbell, whose lawsuit in Southern Florida District Court says she was a VP of marketing and brand identity, says in the complaint that she was hired by Rony Abovitz, the CEO by the Dania Beach, Florida-based company to ""help with the pink/blue"" problem, referring to the lack of women in leadership positions at the company. 
 
 She also claims that Magic Leap had a culture that assumed its employees were men, including what she says was an internal email describing a policy for ""bored wives at home while you are loving it at the Leap."" 
 
 ""All the engineers and others in predominately-male Magic Leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink,"" the lawsuit alleges. 
 
 According to Campbell's complaint, many of the executives at Magic Leap blocked her efforts to reform company policy before she was fired in late December. 
 
 Magic Leap has raised $1.39 billion dollars in venture capital, valuing the company at $4.5 billion, from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Google, JPMorgan, Fidelity and Alibaba. The company promises to integrate computer graphics into the real world in a stunning way — a whale jumping out of a gym floor, for example. 
 
 But as Business Insider has previously reported, questions remain whether the company can shrink its technology into a mobile, portable form factor. A prototype described to Business Insider by a source as ""the real wearable"" and by CEO Abovitz as ""R&D; test rig where we collect room/space data"" shows a bulky backpack containing the device's computer power, although sources and the lawsuit describe the company's prototype as a ""belt pack.""

 Former employees also describe a company with sprawling operations. The lawsuit alleges that the startup has over 1000 employees. 
 
 Magic Leap did not immediately return requests for comment. 
 
 Missed deadlines 
 
 Campbell, who is suing for Magic Leap for sex discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment, connects the lack of women in Magic Leap's leadership and engineering department with claims of missed internal deadlines. 
 
 From the complaint: 
 
 ""The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure, hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines (including launch, which has shifted back at least 4 times in Campbell's 1.5 years at the company) and, literally, prevented Campbell from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the ""pink/blue problem"" or making Magic Leap less of a ""boys club."""" 
 
 Advertisement 
 
 ""Sadly, because Magic Leap seldom hires and does not actively recruit female candidates, the company loses competitive advantage to products like Microsoft's Hololens. Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders."" 
 
 One of the things Campbell connects to her eventual firing was that she challenged Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, comparing herself to the child in the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" who pointed out that the emperor was naked and not in fact wearing extremely cool invisible clothes. 
 
 From the complaint: 
 
 Campbell also raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do—admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues' assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were ""aspirational,"" and not Magic Leap's version of ""alternate facts."" 
 
 Here's the full complaint: 
 
 Know anything about Magic Leap? Email the author at kleswing@businessinsider.com. ||||| Magic Leap, the mysterious augmented reality startup, continues its slow implosion. 
 
 On Monday, a new lawsuit alleged that the Plantation, Fla.-based company promoted a sexist work environment and used misleading marketing materials that inaccurately depicted the product's capabilities. 
 
 Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap's former vice president of strategic marketing and brand identity, filed the suit in a federal court in the Southern District of Florida. 
 
 The lawsuit alleged Campbell was fired because the company's CEO, Rony Abovitz, refused to acknowledge the misogyny within the company and address a hostile work environment. The company is accused of violating the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion. Ultimately, these workplace problems, the lawsuit reads, ""renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars."" 
 
 Founded in 2010, the company is developing an augmented reality headset that superimposes virtual objects onto the real world, and has amassed $1.4 billion from the likes Google and Alibaba, despite no announced product for sale yet. Late last year, an article by the Information reported that investors poured money into the company after seeing impressive demonstrations of early prototypes, but the actual first commercial product will unlikely possess those same capabilities. And last week, a Business Insider article showed a widely-mocked image of what is reportedly a crude prototype of the device. 
 
 In the lawsuit, Campbell said she brought up concerns that the company was showing off marketing material that didn't accurately reflect what Magic Leap's technology could actually do. The warnings were ""ignored in favor of her male colleagues’ assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap’s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap’s version of 'alternate facts,' "" the lawsuit said in an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald J. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway's infamous use of the term ""alternative facts."" 
 
 Campbell joined Magic Leap in April 2015 when there were no women in leadership positions, the lawsuit said. During Campbell's initial interview at Magic Leap, she joked that the company's advertising department was a ""boys club,"" but Abovitz told her he was looking to change that. 
 
 ""All the engineers and others in predominately-male Magic Leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink,"" the lawsuit said. 
 
 The company's mostly male leadership team is made up of what the lawsuit described as ""Abovitz sycophants."" The one female leader, chief business officer Rachna Bhasin, is characterized as ""the perfect Magic Leap female employee: she went [to] Harvard, never disagrees with Abovitz and always does Abovitz's bidding even when common sense or her own experience run counter. She makes the company appear diverse and inclusive although it is not."" 
 
 In the first few months at Magic Leap, Campbell said she tried to change things. She came up with a PowerPoint presentation that outlined that only 14% of overall Magic Leap employees were female and 3% of engineering staff were female. She offered proposals to encourage more female inclusion in the short term, like recruiting from colleges with high numbers of female engineers, and in the long term, like tying bonuses to boosting diversity numbers. The lawsuit said Abovitz kept putting off these meetings, or cutting them short when they happened. 
 
 Eventually, Abovitz put together the ""female brain trust initiative"" (or FBI), headed up by Bhasin, to make sure Magic Leap product design and content was developed with women in mind. The first meeting on May 18, 2016 presented a prototype with the power supply implemented in a ""belt pack,"" and recommended not having the headset connect in the back of the head, to make it easier to wear for people with long hair or ponytails. The group make no inroads and none of the proposals made it into the design process. The group was pure ""window dressing,"" the lawsuit alleged. Abovitz and other men didn't show up to later meetings. 
 
 The lawsuit said three or four core apps that the standard Magic Leap headset will end up shipping with included a game called ""Dr. G,"" which had no lead female characters. The one female character is ""busty"" and depicted as groveling on her knees at the main character's feet. Campbell complained repeatedly to the designers with no success about the game's misogyny, the complaint said. 
 
 Sexist attitudes were abundant at the company, the lawsuit said. In one instance, Campbell attended a conference call in September 2016 with several executives to talk with advertising agency R/GA. During the call, Magic Leap CFO Scott Henry said, ""I’m sitting here between two beautiful ladies. They’re not going to want to put a big ugly device over their pretty faces. And I have an office with glass doors, I don’t want people to see me with these beautiful girls with ugly things on their faces,"" the complaint alleged, referring to Campbell and the company's head of operations, Tina Tuli. After the call, R/GA executives expressed concern about Henry's remarks. 
 
 Campbell, who joined as head of advertising, was made vice president only after she asked for the promotion in September 2016. Campbell said in the lawsuit that this is an example of the company's leadership inability to make decisions. 
 
 ""Abovitz was incapable of making decisions,"" the lawsuit said, ""but rather kept putting things off pending more meetings and assigning more people to solve the problem, which was one of the primary reasons Magic Leap could not bring its product to market."" 
 
 After the the promotion, the complaint said Campbell was marginalized in the leadership team. In her last four months, it said Abovitz ""who always had been pouty and prone to temper-tantrums, began to dig his heels in even more in the face of dissenting ideas and to explode ever more frequently into child-like fits of rage, threatening retribution when he didn’t get his way, felt betrayed or was portrayed publically [sic] in an unfavorable light."" 
 
 In Campbell's final months at Magic Leap, Abovitz disinvited her from meetings. In November 2016, Abovitz told Campbell to interview employees about their opinions of the company. She told Abovitz Magic Leap should instead work towards branding for a target audience, not just employees. Regardless, Campbell followed orders and presented her findings on December 20, but was instead fired. Magic Leap offered Campbell a three-months severance if she released all claims against the company. She refused to sign. 
 
 The lawsuit alleged the company's sexism has lead to dysfunction and is losing out to competitors like Microsoft's HoloLens. ""Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders,"" the complainant said. 
 
 Magic Leap hasn't responded to a request for comment.

When Tannen Campbell was hired by Magic Leap in 2015, the Florida company had no women in leadership roles and its only idea to make its product female-friendly was to release a pink version, according to Forbes. The lawsuit filed by Campbell following her firing in December describes a ""macho bullying atmosphere,"" Business Insider reports. That allegedly includes tolerating sexist and offensive behavior, such as telling new hires to stay away from ""Orientals, Old People, and Ovaries"" and having the only female character in a centerpiece app ""on her knees grovelling at the heroes."" Furthermore, Campbell alleges her efforts to change the culture at Magic Leap were consistently thwarted. The lawsuit states Campbell was asked to put together a presentation on the lack of gender diversity at the company, but it took seven months for Magic Leap's chief executive to show up for the presentation, and he left in the middle of it. Campbell says she and other female employees were ignored when giving input on the design of the product and its marketing.

8,"Research suggests that the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger in males may be predictive of a variety of disorders related to disturbed hormonal balance. When the index finger is shorter than the ring finger, this results in a small 2D:4D ratio, pointing to a high exposure to testosterone in the uterus. 
 
 In a new study of 103 male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 matched healthy male individuals, investigators found that the 2D:4D ratio may be an effective predictor of schizophrenia--there were significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio of the lengths of the second digit to the fourth digit, as well as its asymmetry, in both hands. 
 
 ""Asymmetry index showed moderate discriminatory power and, therefore asymmetry index has a potential utility as a diagnostic test in determining the presence of schizophrenia,"" said Dr. Taner Oznur, co-author of the Clinical Anatomy study. 
 
 ### ||||| The production of androgens (mostly testosterone) during the early fetal stage is essential for the differentiation of the male brain. Some authors have suggested a relationship between androgen exposure during the prenatal period and schizophrenia. These two separate relationships suggest that digit length ratios are associated with schizophrenia in males. The study was performed in a university hospital between October 2012 and May 2013. One hundred and three male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM‐IV using SCID‐I, and 100 matched healthy males, were admitted to the study. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess schizophrenia symptoms. The second digit (2D) and fourth digit (4D) asymmetry index (AI), and the right‐ and left‐hand 2D:4D ratios were calculated. All parametric data in the groups were compared using an independent t‐test. The predictive power of the AI was estimated by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The 2D:4D AI was statistically significantly lower in the patient group than the healthy control comparison group. There were significant differences between the schizophrenia and the control groups in respect of left 2D:4D and right 2D:4D. There was no correlation between AI, left, or right 2D:4D, BPRS, or SAPS in the schizophrenia group. However, there was a negative correlation between left 2nd digit (L2D):4D and the SANS score. Our findings support the view that the 2D:4D AI can be used as a moderate indicator of schizophrenia. Even more simply, the right or left 2D:4D can be used as an indicator. L2D:4D could indicate the severity of negative symptoms. Clin. Anat. 28:551–556, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","– The length of a man's index and ring fingers have recently been linked from everything to promiscuity and how nice he is to women. The idea is that finger lengths change depending on exposure to testosterone in utero, and it's known as the ""2D:4D"" ratio. A lower ratio—where the second digit is shorter than the fourth—indicates ""greater androgen exposure."" In the journal Clinical Anatomy, researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia; they take that one step further, hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males. Then they set out to test that hypothesis: In their small study, researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 Turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls. They found ""significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands,"" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was ""significantly higher"" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was ""significantly lower""—suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone ""affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,"" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients.

9,"HOUSTON – Almost two years ago, a pair of United Airlines employees allegedly laughed at, cursed at and even physically injured an area attorney when he asked for a new boarding pass, according to a recently filed lawsuit. 
 
 Seeking more than $1 million in damages, Ronald Tigner filed suit against United on June 7 in Harris County. Alejandro Anastasia and Ianthe Phillips-Allred are also named as defendants. 
 
 According to the lawsuit, on July 21, 2015, Tigner was attempting to catch a flight out of Bush Intercontinental Airport. He allegedly received a boarding pass that was “illegible” that United refused to reprint. 
 
 TSA then refused to allow him to pass through the security checkpoint “because of the illegible pass,” obliging him to proceed back to the United ticketing area. 
 
 “Defendants Anastasia and Allred, among other things, refused to offer assistance to plaintiff, laughed at plaintiff, cursed at plaintiff … and Anastasia suddenly, unexpectedly and violently injured plaintiff,” the suit states, adding that United and its employees violated the company’s core value: “We Fly Right.” 
 
 The suit does not state what provoked the employee to allegedly injure Tigner, and only contends that nothing Tigner did caused or contributed to the incident. 
 
 United is accused of negligently failing to assist Tigner and properly hire and train its employees. 
 
 Tigner is demanding all evidence related to the incident be preserved. 
 
 He is suing for his past and future mental anguish, medical expenses, pain, lost wages, impairment and disfigurement. 
 
 Katy attorney William Hoke represents him. 
 
 Harris County District Court Cause No. 2017-37998 ||||| A 71-year-old man is suing United Airlines for $1 million after he was pushed to the ground by an employee in 2015. The employee was charged with a felony of injuring an elderly individual. (KPRC) 
 
 United Airlines issued an apology Tuesday after a video was released of a Houston-based employee pushing a 71-year-old passenger to the floor during an argument over a ticket. The man was left lying there motionless. 
 
 The confrontation took place about two years ago but was detailed in a lawsuit filed last week in Harris County, Tex. The airline is still facing fallout over an incident with David Dao, a passenger who was violently dragged off a flight in Chicago in April. 
 
 The video of the Texas pushing incident was obtained and broadcast Tuesday evening by Houston news station KPRC. 
 
 The passenger, Ronald Tigner, a Houston lawyer, is suing United and two of its employees for more than $1 million, alleging negligence in the incident that took place July 21, 2015, at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. 
 
 In response to the video, United released a statement to KPRC saying it is “disturbed by the completely unacceptable behavior shown in a video of a customer and a former United employee.” The employee is no longer with the company, according to the statement. 
 
 “The actions shown here do not reflect our core values or our commitment to treat all of our customers with respect and dignity,” United’s statement read. “We are reviewing all circumstances surrounding this incident and reaching out to our customer through his attorney to profusely apologize for what occurred and to make this right.” 
 
 The encounter began when Tigner received a boarding pass that was illegible. He made “numerous attempts” to ask for a reprinted pass, but United agents denied him one, according to the lawsuit. 
 
 He was told to continue on to the security checkpoint, where Transportation Security Administration authorities refused to let Tigner enter because of his poorly printed pass. 
 
 So Tigner went back to the United ticketing area and tried once more to get a new ticket, the lawsuit states. Two United employees, Alejandro Anastasia and Ianthe Phillips-Allred, allegedly refused to help Tigner, laughing and cursing at him, the lawsuit states. 
 
 Tigner’s attorney, William Hoke, told KPRC that when Tigner asked Anastasia for a new ticket, he replied with a smile, saying, “Can’t you see I’m busy?” 
 
 Tigner then told Anastasia to “wipe that smile off your face,” Hoke said, to which Anastasia responded with an obscenity. 
 
 Then, Anastasia “suddenly, unexpectedly and violently injured” Tigner, the lawsuit alleges. 
 
 Surveillance video shows the United employee checking his watch, turning toward Tigner and pushing him to the floor. Tigner remains there motionless on his back, his legs and arms spread out. Meanwhile, a couple of people who appear to be airline employees stand near Tigner. 
 
 But for about 50 seconds, no one appears to bend down to help Tigner, until a woman — identified by Tigner’s lawyer as a flight passenger and nurse — walks over to check on him. 
 
 [United CEO tells Congress dragging man from flight was a ‘horrible failure’ by airline] 
 
 A United employee later called 911, telling the operator, “There’s a 70 year old male that had fallen down,” according to a 911 call published by KPRC. When the operator asked the employee what caused the fall and if the man was awake, the caller said he did not know. 
 
 Anastasia was later charged with a felony of injuring an elderly individual, KPRC reported. He was fined and ordered to attend anger-management classes and apologize to Tigner. 
 
 The lawsuit alleges the confrontation caused Tigner to sustain “severe personal injuries and damages,” and incur medical expenses and lost wages. It says the altercation left him with “physical disfigurement” and caused him to experience “mental anguish.” 
 
 It also says that nothing Tigner did or failed to do “caused or contributed to the incident.” 
 
 The lawsuit follows a number of high-profile controversies involving United, and the airline industry as a whole. In April, Dao refused to give up his seat on an overbooked United flight and was dragged off bloodied and limp, to the disgust of other passengers who captured it on video. Dao suffered a concussion, broken nose and two missing teeth, among other injuries, The Washington Post reported. 
 
 Since then, other airlines have come under fire for kicking a family off a flight due to a dispute over a birthday cake and booting a passenger from a plane for using a restroom. 
 
 One of the most recent confrontations also involved Houston-based United Airlines agents, who told Yennifer Correia she would have to check her 17th-century violin. 
 
 A “wrestling match” ensued, The Post reported, leaving Correia with an injured hand.

 When Dao refused to give up his seat onboard an overbooked flight, security officers began dragging him down the aisle and off the plane in front of horrified passengers. 
 
 Now, Channel 2 Investigates has obtained video of another physical confrontation between United employees and a 71-year-old Houston man at Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2015. That man has filed a lawsuit. 
 
 VIDEO: Full airport surveillance video of United worker pushing Houston passenger to ground 
 
 ""This is just one of the most inhumane things I've ever seen in my life,"" attorney William Hoke said. 
 
 In the video, recorded on a surveillance camera at the airport, Ronald Tigner -- a frequent flyer, father and grandfather -- is shown being pushed to the ground by a United Airlines customer service rep, right in front of the United ticket counter. 
 
 After hitting his head on the ground, Tigner lies motionless with his arms splayed out and yet not one United employee bothers to bend down and talk to him. 
 
 ""He violently shoves a 71-year-old man to the ground,"" Hoke said. 
 
 ""Was your client knocked unconscious? Was he out?"" KPRC 2's Bill Spencer asked. 
 
 ""He was. He lied there,"" Hoke said. ""He lies there lifeless for minutes. Not one employee comes to check on him."" 
 
 ""None of the United employees even bend down to see if he's OK, to see it he's alive?"" Spencer asked. 
 
 VIDEO: United apologizes to passenger 
 
 ""No one even went to check his pulse,"" Hoke said. ""They literally left him there like a piece of garbage."" 
 
 In fact, over the course of the nearly three-minute surveillance video, not one United employee ever appears to try to comfort the man in any way. 
 
 Fifty seconds into the video, a passenger walking by stops to help, as United employees just watch. 
 
 ""It was a good Samaritan, who was a nurse, that was catching a flight, ran over and said, 'Please, God. Someone call 911,'"" Hoke said. 
 
 When a United worker does call 911, he doesn't say the man was pushed down, or that's he's unconscious. 
 
 911: ""What is the emergency?"" 
 
 Worker: ""There's a 70-year-old male that had fallen down."" 
 
 911: ""OK, is he awake?"" 
 
 Worker: ""I don't know."" 
 
 911: ""You know what the cause of the fall?"" 
 
 Worker: ""No.""

 ""It's astonishing,"" Hoke said. ""It's outrageous."" 
 
 Now Tigner is suing United Airlines, Alejandro Anastasia -- the man who pushed him -- and another United employee for negligence. 
 
 Hoke claims this all began with Tigner simply asking Anastasia for a new boarding pass because the one he had was garbled. The suit claims Anastasia laughed at him and cursed at him. 
 
 ""Anastasia was looking at Mr. Tigner and started smiling and said, 'Can't you see we're busy?' and there's no one in the vicinity of these two employees,"" Hoke said. ""And he tells Anastasia to wipe that smile off his face. That's when Anastasia says, 'I'll kick your (expletives)' and shoves Tigner to the ground."" 
 
 Anastasia was later charged with the felony crime of injury to an elderly individual, ordered to pay a fine, write a letter of apology and attend anger-management classes. 
 
 He was fired after the incident, according to United. 
 
 Alejandro Nestor Anstasia 
 
 Channel 2 Investigates went to Anastasia's home, but no one answered the door. 
 
 ""Mr. Anastasia, what would possess you to throw a 71-year-old man to the floor?"" Spencer had asked. 
 
 Tigner is suing United Airlines for more than $1 million. 
 
 ""We want people to come forward who've been treated just like Mr. Tigner and like Dr. Dao, any of the other people who've flown United and been treated this way, because this has to stop,"" Hoke said. 
 
 United Airlines called Tigner's lawyer to offer an apology on Wednesday. 
 
 ""(They said) they're truly sorry this happened to Mr. Tigner and they wanted me to convey that to him,"" Hoke said. 
 
 United released the following statement: 
 
 ""We have seen the video from 2015 that shows completely unacceptable behavior by a United employee. This employee is no longer with our company. The conduct shown here does not reflect our values or our commitment to treat all of our customers with respect and dignity. We are taking a thorough look into what happened here and reaching out to our customer to profusely apologize for what occurred and to make this right.""

10,"DeShazo and Bigler's work is published in the American Journal of Medicine. This is what they saw: 
 
 (University of Mississippi) 
 
 The nugget from the first restaurant (breading not included) was approximately 50 percent muscle. The other half was primarily fat, with some blood vessels and nerve, as well as ""generous quantities of epithelium [from skin and visceral organs] and associated supportive tissue."" That broke down overall to 56 percent fat, 25 percent carbohydrates, and 19 percent protein. 
 
 The nugget from the second restaurant was 40 percent skeletal muscle, as well as ""generous quantities of fat and other tissue, including connective tissue and bone."" That was 58 percent fat, 24 percent carbs, and 18 percent protein. 
 
 ""We've taken a very healthy product—lean, white meat—and processed it, goo-ed it up with fat, sugar, and salt [in the breading],"" he said. ""Kids love that combination."" So do non-kids. 
 
 DeShazo and Bigler's conclusion: ""Chicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name is a misnomer."" That is, ""because the predominant components aren't chicken."" At least, not in the sense that chicken implies meat (not fat and skin). 
 
 ""When chicken is processed, there's some chicken left on the bone,"" deShazo—who also hosts a wellness program on the local public radio affiliate— explained. ""You can actually vibrate that stuff off, and you get these chicken leftovers, and you can put it together, mix it up with other substances, and come out with a goo that you can fry and call a chicken nugget. It's a combination of chicken, carbohydrates, and fats, and other substances that make it glue together. It's almost like super glue that we're eating. In some fast-food restaurants."" 
 
 Chef Jamie Oliver made nuggets that way a few years ago on his television show Food Revolution, in front of kids, chopping and blending a remnant carcass. The feckless children screamed, but still asked to eat the nuggets. ""We've brainwashed our kids so brilliantly,"" Oliver said, ""that even though they know something is disgusting and gross, they'll still eat it if it's in that friendly little shape."" 
 
 The National Chicken Council (NCC) is unimpressed by deShazo's work. ""Chicken nuggets are an excellent source of protein,"" Dr. Ashley Peterson, NCC's vice president of science and technology, told Reuters. ""Especially for kids who might be picky eaters. This study evaluates only two chicken nugget samples out of the billions of chicken nuggets that are made every year."" 
 
 The NCC maintains, in an appeal to food nostalgia, ""Mechanically separated chicken has been used in poultry products since 1969."" What's more, emphasis theirs, ""[Mechanically separated chicken] is NOT typically used in chicken nuggets or patties. Mechanically separated poultry is regulated and inspected by USDA and products containing it must declare it as an ingredient on the label. Mechanical systems prevent waste of nutritious meat and avoid the repetitive motion that would be required to perform close trimming by hand."" ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Stand-up comedians have long joked that some things, like the actual components of chicken nuggets, are better left mysterious. 
 
 Recently, Mississippi researchers found out why: two nuggets they examined consisted of 50 percent or less chicken muscle tissue, the breast or thigh meat that comes to mind when a customer thinks of ""chicken."" 
 
 The nuggets came from two national fast food chains in Jackson. The three researchers selected one nugget from each box, preserved, dissected and stained the nuggets, then looked at them under a microscope. 
 
 The first nugget was about half muscle, with the rest a mix of fat, blood vessels and nerves. Close inspection revealed cells that line the skin and internal organs of the bird, the authors write in the American Journal of Medicine. 
 
 The second nugget was only 40 percent muscle, and the remainder was fat, cartilage and pieces of bone. 
 
 ""We all know white chicken meat to be one of the best sources of lean protein available and encourage our patients to eat it,"" lead author Dr. Richard D. deShazo of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said. 
 
 ""What has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,"" deShazo told Reuters Health. 
 
 ""It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them."" 
 
 The nuggets he examined would be okay to eat occasionally, but he worries that since they are cheap, convenient and taste good, kids eat them often. His own grandchildren ""beg"" for chicken nuggets all the time, and he compromises by making them at home by pan-frying chicken breasts with a small amount of oil, deShazo said. 
 
 ""Chicken nuggets are an excellent source of protein, especially for kids who might be picky eaters,"" said Ashley Peterson, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs for the National Chicken Council (NCC), a non-profit trade group representing the U.S. chicken industry. 
 
 According to the NCC, its member producers and processors account for about 95 percent of the chicken produced in the U.S. 
 
 ""This study evaluates only two chicken nugget samples out of the billions of chicken nuggets that are made every year,"" Peterson said. A sample size of two nuggets is simply too small to generalize to an entire category of food, she told Reuters Health. 
 
 Two nuggets is a small sample size, deShazo acknowledged, and some chains have begun to use primarily white meat in their nuggets - just not the particular restaurants he visited. 
 
 ""Chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried. But it's no secret what is in a chicken nugget - most quick service restaurants have nutritional information posted in the store or on their website,"" Peterson said. 
 
 ""And every package of chicken nuggets in the grocery store by law contains an ingredient list and a complete nutritional profile, including fat content,"" she said. 
 
 The brief chicken nugget exploration was not meant to be an exposé of the chicken industry or fast food generally, but to remind consumers that ""not everything that tastes good is good for you,"" deShazo said. 
 
 He and his colleagues chose not to reveal which chain restaurants they visited. 
 
 Consumers aren't necessarily being misled, since much of the nutritional information they need is readily available, he said. 
 
 ""We just don't take the time to understand basic nutritional facts.""

 Dressed in an orange jail uniform and walking with a cane, a hand-cuffed Patrick Sullivan, 68, watched as a judge raised his bail amount to a half-million dollars and sent him back to the Patrick J. Sullivan Jr. Detention Facility. 
 
 Arapahoe County chief judge William Sylvester also told him not to contact anyone involved in the case. 
 
 Sullivan's arrest has many in the wealthy suburban Denver county where he held sway nearly three decades wondering what happened to the lawman who was once named the nation's sheriff of the year. 
 
 ""This isn't the Pat I know,"" said Peg Ackerman, a lobbyist for the County Sheriffs of Colorado who often worked with him on legislation. She said he was concerned about drug use in schools and was a chief of security at a school district. 
 
 The current sheriff, Grayson Robinson, who worked as undersheriff for Sullivan from 1997 until he took over the job in 2002, said the department was shocked and saddened. 
 
 Robinson said the case is still under investigation, including where and how Sullivan might have gotten the drugs. He declined to say if authorities suspect Sullivan of using drugs, or if others might be charged. 
 
 Sullivan's attorney, Kevin McGreevy, did not return calls seeking comment. 
 
 Sullivan came to the attention of law enforcement after an Oct. 4 call to authorities from a home in Centennial, according to an arrest affidavit. The deputy who responded had worked for Sullivan and knew who he was. 
 
 After investigating further, the deputy learned from two confidential informants that Sullivan was dealing meth but would sell it only if they had sex with him, the document stated. He was arrested after police set up a sting at a home. 
 
 Deputies found that Sullivan had handed someone a bag of meth and had another bag on him when he was searched, according to the affidavit. Both bags weighed less than a gram. 
 
 Sullivan served as sheriff from 1984 until his retirement in 2002. In 2002, U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo praised him on his retirement, citing Sullivan for among other things being named Sheriff of the Year by the National Sheriff's Association. 
 
 While those who know Sullivan were puzzled by the news, some said they weren't surprised that a person of his stature could get involved. They said meth users will do almost anything to feed their habit and often hurt others in the process.

 DENVER — Patrick Sullivan was the kind of lawman Coloradoans loved: a straight-shooting Republican sheriff who once crashed a Jeep through a fence to rescue two deputies from a gunman and pleaded with legislators to keep assault weapons off the street lest any more citizens get shot. 
 
 On Tuesday afternoon, though, investigators from the same sheriff’s department he oversaw for nearly two decades found themselves monitoring a home near Denver that Mr. Sullivan was seen entering. 
 
 Soon after, the police arrested Mr. Sullivan, now 68 and long retired from the Arapahoe County sheriff’s office, on charges that he had been trying to exchange methamphetamines for sex with a man. He was booked that night at a local county jail that proudly bears his name. 
 
 “The Arapahoe County sheriff’s office is saddened, and this is a sad time for our community,” said Grayson Robinson, the current sheriff, who served under Mr. Sullivan. “But we have a greater purpose, to serve our community with integrity and professionalism, and that’s exactly what we’ve done with this investigation.”

 Sheriff Robinson said the police began an investigation into Mr. Sullivan’s activities on Nov. 17 after several people informed the authorities that he might be involved with methamphetamines. 
 
 The investigation led the police to a home on Tuesday where they say Mr. Sullivan had arranged to provide drugs to a man, a longtime associate, in exchange for sex. Mr. Sullivan was taken into custody without incident, Sheriff Robinson said. 
 
 According to a probable cause statement filed in court on Wednesday morning, two confidential informers told the police that they had engaged in sexual activity with Mr. Sullivan before, in exchange for methamphetamines or cash. 
 
 Word of the arrest shot through Arapahoe County, a sprawling suburban area near Denver, where Mr. Sullivan served as sheriff from 1984 to 2002. 
 
 “I just cannot believe this happened,” said Robert R. Gallagher Jr., a former district attorney for the 18th Judicial District in Colorado, which includes Arapahoe County. “This is not the Pat Sullivan I served with and respected so much. Something here doesn’t meet the eye.” 
 
 Steve Ward, a former state senator and past Arapahoe County commissioner, said he, too, was stunned by the news.

 “It’s like waking up and reading a headline that says ‘Scientists Have Now Determined the Earth Is Flat,’ ” he said. “It’s incomprehensible.” 
 
 Mr. Sullivan, whose dramatic rescue of his deputies in 1989 was captured on television, was named national Sheriff of the Year in 2001 and became a widely respected law enforcement figure here. 
 
 After the Columbine High School shooting near Littleton and his retirement, he became director of safety and security for the Cherry Creek School District, a position he held from 2002 to 2008. 
 
 “We are absolutely stunned at the news of Mr. Sullivan’s arrest and are fully cooperating with the Arapahoe County sheriff’s office,” Mary Chesley, the district’s superintendent, said in a statement. 
 
 Mr. Sullivan will face charges of “unlawful distribution, manufacturing, dispensing or sale of a controlled substance,” punishable by up to six years in prison. Sheriff Robinson said he anticipated that additional charges would be filed. 
 
 At an initial court appearance on Wednesday, a judge raised Mr. Sullivan’s bond to half a million dollars from $250,000 at the urging of the local district attorney’s office. Sheriff Robinson said the request was made because of the nature of the accusations and the continuing investigation.

 CENTENNIAL — Authorities began investigating former Araphoe County Sheriff Patrick Sullivan after a Centennial man called police in September and said ""an old guy"" was trying to get his roommates back into drugs and had been smoking methamphetamine with them, according to a police report. 
 
 When the Centennial man asked Sullivan to leave and said he was going to call 911, Sullivan told the man ""If you want the police I am the police,"" the man told officers. 
 
 Sullivan later told detectives he is on a meth drug task force and helps recovering addicts get clean, according to another report. He also said he worked for the state health department's drug treatment office.

 one of them said Sullivan has power of attorney for him. The 34-year-old man also said Sullivan cashes the man's Social Security checks, gives him cash from them, and takes the man shopping when needed. 
 
 A spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said this afternoon there is no record of Sullivan working there, or of the department having a meth treatment program. 
 
 The reports give the first insight into how a well respected, longtime law enforcment icon came to be standing before a judge this morning facing drug charges. 
 
 After a brief huddle with a prosecutor and defense attorney, a Judge William Sylvester this morning doubled Sullivan's bond from $250,000 to $500,000. 
 
 Prosecutor Karen Pearson would not comment on why she sought to increase the bond and Sylvester offered no explanation. He issued a mandatory protection order preventing Sullivan from having contact with any potential witness in the case. 
 
 An investigative report filed in court in support of Sullivan's arrest says officers from the South Metro Drug Task Force, including Arapahoe deputies, used confidential informants and audio and video surveillance in the investigation. 
 
 According to the court 
 
 papers: 
 
 After a complaint in early October to the Arapahoe sheriff's office that an ""unwanted party"" was at a home in Centennial, a deputy arrived and identified the person there as the former sheriff. 
 
 Agent Matt Hanagan of the drug task force was brought in to the case and asked two confidential informants who worked with the task force whether they thought they could purchase methamphetamine from Sullivan. Both of them said they had engaged in sex acts with Sullivan in the past and said they would be willing to ask him for meth in exchange for a sex act. 
 
 After several phone calls and text messages, Sullivan agreed to meet one of the men at an Aurora home and bring meth to exchange for sex.

 He was taken into custody and officers found additional suspected meth — a total of 0.7 grams. 
 
 Sullivan was booked into the jail that bears his name on a charge of unlawful distribution, manufacturing, dispensing or sale of a controlled substance. The Class 5 felony carries a penalty of up to six years in prison. 
 
 During this morning's brief hearing, Judge Sylvester asked Sullivan if he had any questions, and Sullivan said no. He kept his head down and leaned on a cane through the proceedings. He was handcuffed and wore an orange jail jumpsuit. No members of his family appeared to be in the courtroom. 
 
 Sullivan's attorney, Kevin McGreevy, declined to comment. 
 
 Sullivan is being held in the Patrick J. Sullivan Jr. Detention Facility. He was sheriff from 1984 until his retirement in 2002. 
 
 Sullivan retired from law enforcement to become director of safety and security for Cherry Creek Schools in 2002, retiring from there in 2008. 
 
 Former Arapahoe County Commissioner Jim Dyer, who was not on the commission when Sullivan was sheriff, said Tuesday night he was shocked when told of the sheriff's arrest. 
 
 ""I knew he had a distinguished career,"" Dyer said. ""I think he was a good guy. That's shocking. I am absolutely astounded."" 
 
 Steve Ward, a former county commissioner who worked with Sullivan, said he ""couldn't be more shocked."" 
 
 Former Arapahoe County District Attorney Jim Peters, who worked with Sullivan, said the allegations against the former sheriff are ""totally out of character"" for the man he knew and are ""hard to believe.""

 CHARLOTTE — It isn't often that Hillary Clinton lets her guard down about what she really thinks about the Republican presidential race. 
 
 But during a commercial break while taping an MSNBC town hall on Monday, Clinton and host Chris Matthews chatted it up about the state of the race. 
 
 Clinton scolded the media for its constant coverage of the GOP front-runner Donald Trump, speculated about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's political future and his motivations for endorsing Donald Trump. 
 
 ""You guys can’t stop covering him,"" Clinton told Matthews. ""He is a dangerous presence."" 
 
 ""It’s just like candy by the bushel."" 
 
 Matthews followed up by acknowledging that his network has a ""progressive audience, obviously."" 
 
 ""But nobody can tell what people want to watch,"" he said. 
 
 ""People must think they want to watch him,"" Clinton replied. 
 
 ""They laugh at him,"" said Matthews. 
 
 The subject quickly turned to Christie, and Clinton wondered: ""Why did he support him?"" 
 
 Matthews explained that Christie and others who support Trump ""want a future"" politically. 
 
 ""Did he have a debt?"" Clinton mused. 
 
 Matthews added that New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, ""isn't going anywhere,"" which leaves Christie ""nowhere"" to go in New Jersey politics. 
 
 ""I don’t think he would win right now,"" Clinton chimed in. 
 
 ""I don’t think he can win as a Senate candidate either,"" Matthews agreed.

 Clinton told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, who moderated the event in Springfield, Illinois, that she holds Trump responsible for the violence seen in recent days at his rallies, and believes his rhetoric is not only wrong and offensive, but also “dangerous.” “He’s been building this incitement,” she said.

 “When you are inciting mob violence, which is what Trump is doing,” Clinton said, “there’s a lot of memories that people have. They’re in the DNA. People remember mob violence that lead to lynching, people remember mob violence that lead to people being shot, being grabbed, being mistreated. And it’s something that has a deep, almost psychological resonance to people who have ever been in any position of feeling somewhat fearful, somewhat worried.” 
 
 Clinton also took tough questions from Matthews on her history of supporting military intervention abroad, including the Iraq War.

 The former senator and secretary of state said she believed Iraq had nuclear weapons in the lead up to the war, noting that the Clinton administration believed that Iraq obfuscated its plans from international weapons inspectors during her husband’s final years in office. 
 
 But Clinton said Bush misled the Congress in saying the vote for military authorization in Iraq would not be used to actually go to war. “I believed George W. Bush when he said we’re going to let the inspectors finish the job. ‘This vote will give me the leverage,’ he claimed, ‘to make sure that happens,’ ” she said. 
 
 On regime change in general, Clinton insisted she is not a hawk. “No, I’m a smart power advocate,” she said. And while she agreed that toppling dictators or foreign government is not advisable in “the vast majority of cases,” there are exceptions, like in Rwanda and the hypothetical of assassinating Hitler before he took power in Germany. “You cannot paint with a broad brush,” she said. 
 
 Matthews also pressed her on why she changed her position on the Trans Pacific Partnership, the massive trade deal with a dozen Asian countries she came out against last year. Sanders had opposed it from the beginning. MSNBC conducted a separate town hall with Sanders, moderated by Chuck Todd, which aired immediately before Clinton’s.

13,"Janet Napolitano was just three months into her tenure as secretary of Homeland Security when Matt Drudge bestowed a nickname on her: ""Big Sis."" The nickname stuck, thanks to Drudge's perseverance. Since that first story in April 2009, the Big Sis brand has been trotted out for dozens of Napolitano stories, from the scary (""BIG SIS: Napolitano to Kill Spy-Satellite Program"") to the silly (""BIG SIS: Napolitano enlists Girl Scouts in effort to combat hurricanes, pandemics, terror attacks"") to—most important—the creepy sexual stuff about the Transportation Security Administration. In January 2010, Drudge linked to a story about the government acquiring body scanners by pressing the Caps-Lock key and breaking out a photo illustration of Napolitano eying a scan of a nude: ""BIG SIS WANTS TO SEE UNDER YOUR CLOTHES."" 
 
 Ten months later, there is a full-blown revolt against the TSA and body scanners (which are sold by a firm with the poetically unfortunate name of Rapiscan). The revolt will crest next Wednesday, with National Opt-Out Day on the busiest travel period of the year. The accidental guerilla heroico of the revolt is John Tyner, who refused a full-body scan at San Diego International Airport then refused to let TSA agents manually search him. ""You touch my junk,"" he said, ""and I'm going to have you arrested."" 
 
 What does this have to do with Matt Drudge? The Tyner Mutiny went viral because the Drudge Report gave it the blaring-siren treatment. And the site gave it the blaring-siren treatment because conservatives have been ready for a very long time to return to a familiar and comfortable opinion of Homeland Security: It must be stopped.

 That opinion was in hibernation, then partial hibernation, for a long time. Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state—of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove—was mistrust. The second most common opinion was fear. And the return of those emotions is a lagging reaction to the fact that Republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security. They can say what they think, which is that the state can't be trusted. 
 
 It's worth remembering that the idea of a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security came from the Democratic Party just after the 9/11 attacks. (Just after 9/11, President Bush created an Office of Homeland Security within the White House.) It wasn't until 2002 that the Republican Party latched on to the concept and took ownership of it. As they pushed DHS through the House, however, Republicans made concessions that demonstrated just how ambivalent they were about the idea of a massive new national-security bureaucracy. Plans for national ID cards and a system to inform on possible terrorists were killed by Republicans like then majority leader and current Tea Party icon Dick Armey. Certain homeland security proposals, he said, were ""not consistent with a free society."" 
 
 At the time, only 12 Republicans voted against the House bill creating DHS. Most Republican candidates used their support of ""a strong DHS,"" which quickly became a byword for ""being serious about terrorism,"" to clobber Democrats who wanted the new federal workers hired to staff the new department to be unionized. This was not something conservatives believed in deeply. It was a useful—and, if you ask Max Cleland, successful—campaign issue. 
 
 There were always critics of the strategy. They simply didn't have much pull while Bush was president. Angry criticism of the TSA, DHS, and the surveillance state came out of a rump of congressional Republicans, from think tanks and from talk radio hosts like Alex Jones and pundits like Andrew Napolitano. But none of this challenged Republicans' strategic thinking. The first victories of the conservative civil liberties crowd came in 2007 and 2008, when they successfully beat back a plan for a national ID card—technically, nationally compatible state IDs—that had been scrapped from the first DHS bill. 
 
 Tea Party activists like to date the backlash to big government to the 2008 passage of TARP. But the backlash against the TSA started a little earlier. According to Tom Blank, the deputy administrator of TSA in the post-9/11 years, the agency was always cognizant of how unpopular scanning could be. 
 
 ""I used to sit around and look at these images, dial them back, and ask myself how do I take this to Capitol Hill and not be thrown out on my head?"" said Blank. ""When [Bush's second TSA administrator] Kip Hawley came in [in 2005], he changed that. He saw the politics of it and deep-sixed the program. He deep-sixed it. It got revived after the Christmas bomber."" 
 
 The point about how full-body scanning got restarted is essential—it was the Obama administration picking up an idea that Republicans had cooled on. Republicans accused the administration of degrading security by dialing back war-on-terror prosecutions in the name of human rights; the response was a security measure that would affect all travelers randomly. So maybe the Drudge Report didn't really invent a backlash against Napolitano. The backlash was inevitable. Republican trust in a sprawling and invasive security apparatus was always precarious. Its collapse leaves the TSA and the Obama administration with yet another libertarian, anti-state riot on their hands. 
 
 They have the media, too, for what that's worth. Alex Altman's take on the ""hysteria"" in Time dismissed the backlash as ""tailor-made for the Internet's ephemeral obsessions"" and at odds with a Pew poll showing 81 percent of people accepting full-body scans. ""Sometimes the screams of an aggrieved minority drowns out the rest of the public,"" said Altman, ""and this may be one of those cases."" 
 
 Which may be true. Or not. In 2009, the smart take on the rage against health-care reform was that it was ephemeral, tailor-made for the aggrieved minority, a bunch of anti-government yokels screaming about a policy they didn't understand. Yet that rage clearly lasted long enough to hurt the Democrats at the polls this month. And health care reform at least had a cheering section in the liberal press. That press isn't cheering on the TSA. Democrats aren't particularly fond of the way the TSA operates. Pilots aren't happy. In an age of right-wing backlashes to the state, the only surprise is that this took so long.

 It's a safe bet Bush would charge, as he did more than once during his presidency, that Democrats are ""not interested in the security of the American people."" Other Republicans would no doubt be running ads juxtaposing Democrats with Osama bin Laden, or alleging, as they did then, that Democrats are giving ""comfort to America's enemies."" 
 
 Yet right now, Republicans are providing the comfort. They are objecting loudly to new airport security measures designed to detect bombs hidden under clothing. And they are blocking a Senate vote on a treaty with Russia that is critical to securing loose nukes and keeping Iran from gaining the bomb. 
 
 For Democrats, the opposition's gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity. Republicans seem to have entered a post-post-9/11 era, in which national security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining President Obama. There's no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against Democrats, but neither would it hurt the White House and congressional Democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken Americans' security. 
 
 Let's start with START, the proposed nuclear pact with Russia that Senate Republicans such as Jon Kyl (Ariz.) are attempting to derail, at least until the next Congress. Since the expiration of the previous START treaty last December, there have been no U.S. inspectors in Russia to keep an eye on the country's thousands of nuclear warheads. If the Senate doesn't come up with the 67 votes needed for ratification, says Travis Sharp of the Center for a New American Security, there's a risk Russia will retaliate by removing its logistical support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan, abandoning its cooperation in preventing nuclear proliferation, and thwarting U.S. efforts to keep Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. 
 
 But don't take his word for it. Listen to Richard Lugar, top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and one man who still puts the national interest above political considerations. ""We're talking today about the national security of the United States of America,"" he pleaded on Wednesday. ""[T]his treaty must be ratified and be ratified in this session of the Congress.... We're talking about thousands of warheads that are still there, an existential problem for our country. To temporize at this point I think is inexcusable."" 
 
 Or listen to Bob Gates, the Bush/Obama defense secretary. ""The new START treaty has the unanimous support of America's military leadership,"" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, calling for a strong bipartisan majority to support the treaty because of ""the security it provides to the American people."" 
 
 To borrow Bush's phrase, are Republicans not interested in the security of the American people? 
 
 Then there's the backlash over the new imaging and pat-downs being used to screen airport passengers for explosives. A CBS News poll found that 81 percent of Americans favor use of the new imaging machines, but Republican lawmakers feel otherwise. 
 
 In the House, Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) has already introduced legislation rescinding the new security. Meanwhile, Republican senators, rediscovering their inner civil libertarians, this week took turns criticizing Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole over the administration's tightened security. 
 
 ""I wouldn't want my wife to be touched in the way that these folks are being touched. I wouldn't want to be touched that way,"" said Sen. George LeMieux (Fla.). ""I think weve gone too far."" 
 
 Sen. Mike Johanns (Neb.) warned of a ""tipping point"" against security screening. ""Does that worry you, that maybe we're at a point here where... people just thing you've overstepped?"" 
 
 Pistole reminded Johanns that ""the threats are real."" 
 
 ""I'm thinking nothing's going to change,"" Johanns complained. 
 
 Pistole's response should shame Johanns and his colleagues. ""If your question is, do I understand the sensitivities of people? Yes. If you're asking, am I going to change the policies? No, because I think that it is being informed by the latest intelligence, the latest efforts by terrorists to kill our people in the air. No, I'm not going to change those policies."" 
 
 This may be the post-post-9/11 era, but Pistole, a career FBI guy, is still interested in the security of the American people. Are Republicans?

 Enlarge this image toggle caption eyecrave LLC/iStockphoto.com eyecrave LLC/iStockphoto.com 
 
 We've reported a lot this year about how there's a major rethinking of fat happening in the U.S. 
 
 Turns out, eating foods with fat — everything from avocados and nuts to dairy fat — doesn't make us fat. 
 
 But eating too many carbohydrates — particularly the heavily refined starches found in bagels, white pasta and crackers — does our collective waistlines no favors. 
 
 A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine adds to the body of evidence that cutting back on carbs, not fat, can lead to more weight loss. 
 
 Researchers at Tulane University tracked two groups of dieters for one year. The participants ranged in age from their early 20s to their mid-70s and included a mix of African-Americans and Caucasians. 
 
 The low-carb group, which reduced their carb consumption to about 28 percent of their daily calories, lost almost three times as much weight as the low-fat dieters who got about 40 to 45 percent of their calories from carbs. 
 
 The low-fat group lost about 4 pounds, whereas the low-carb group's average weight loss was almost 12 pounds. Participants in the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories. 
 
 The study showed that modest reductions in carbohydrate consumption, down to about 28 to 30 percent of diet, could help tip the scales to weight loss. The makeup of the low-carb group's diet was: 28 percent carbs 40 to 43 percent fat (twice as much poly and monounsaturated compared to saturated) about 28 percent protein The makeup of the low-fat group's diet was: 28 percent fat 40 to 45 percent carbs 28 to 32 percent protein 
 
 Lydia Bazzano, one of the study authors and an associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane, says she had anticipated some difference in weight loss between the two groups. But the size of the effect — the nearly 8-pound difference in weight loss — was surprising, she says. 
 
 So, what kinds of meals were the low-carb dieters eating? 
 
 ""Typically in the morning they were eating eggs,"" says Bazzano. Other breakfast items included small portions of high-protein, high-fiber bread, with either butter or other kinds of oily spread. 
 
 As for lunch and dinner, the low-carb dieters ate lots of vegetables, salads and protein, including fish, chicken and some red meat. They had generous portions of healthy fats such as olive oils, canola and other plant-based oils. 
 
 Fat accounted for a sizable part of their diet: from 40 percent to 43 percent of their total daily calories, including about 12 percent from saturated fat. 
 
 Bazzano says with so many people still abiding by low-fat recommendations, a diet so high in fat might not sound like a good weight-loss strategy. ""It's not the general perception,"" she says. 
 
 But, in fact, there are a spate of studies that have come to the same conclusion about the benefits of swapping a low-fat, high-carb strategy for a pattern of eating that emphasizes healthy fats and lower carbohydrate consumption. 
 
 It's not just waistlines that respond. The low-carb, healthy fats approach has been shown to cut the risk of heart disease. 
 
 One big study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 30 percent, compared to a low-fat diet. 
 
 Research published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which compared a low-glycemic-index diet — which minimizes refined starches — with a more traditional low-fat diet, also documented advantages. 
 
 ""We saw improvements in triglycerides, [good] cholesterol, and the possibility of lower chronic inflammation"" among the lower carb group, JAMA study author David Ludwig of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital told us. 
 
 Here's the fascinating part: Ludwig also found that when people stopped eating so many refined carbohydrates, they burned off about 150 more calories per day, compared to those eating a higher carb, lower fat diet. 
 
 ""Too much refined carbohydrates — white bread, white rice, potato products — all the foods that crept into our diets as we've followed the low-fat craze has undermined our metabolism,"" says Ludwig. 
 
 In other words, the high-carb, low-fat pattern of eating ""caused us to become hungrier and burn off fewer calories,"" he says. 
 
 What's happening in the body when we follow this pattern of eating is still the subject of much research, but Ludwig says the thinking goes like this: Eating too many carbs can overstimulate the release of insulin and direct more calories into storage in the fat cells. 
 
 ""It's a double-whammy for weight gain,"" Ludwig says. ""We've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body. It's a very appealing notion, but the problem is it's wrong."" ||||| A low-carbohydrate diet is better for losing weight and may also be better for lowering the risk of heart disease than a low-fat diet, according to a new study. 
 
 While low-carb diets have outperformed other diets when it comes to weight loss, some researchers feared they might be worse for heart health because they tend to be high in fat. 
 
 The new study shows that with proper nutritional counseling, people can lose more weight and lower their risk factors for heart disease on a low-carbohydrate diet, said the lead author, Dr. Lydia Bazzano of Tulane University in New Orleans. 
 
 ""This study shows if you are overweight and have cardiovascular disease risk factors and haven't had success on other diets, certainly a low-carbohydrate diet is worth a try,"" said Bazzano. 
 
 Carbohydrates are found in food and include sugar, fiber and starches that give the body energy. Some carbs - like those in whole grains and fruits - are healthier than others - like those in white bread and other processed foods. 
 
 Bazzano and her colleagues write in Annals of Internal Medicine that low-carb diets have become popular weight loss strategies in recent years. Studies on their effects on cardiovascular risk factors have produced mixed results, however. 
 
 For the new study, she and her colleagues recruited 148 obese men and women between the ages of 22 and 75. None of the participants had heart disease or diabetes. 
 
 Half were randomly assigned to follow a low-carbohydrate diet for a year, and the other half were assigned to a low-fat diet for a year. They were told to not change their physical activity throughout the trial. 
 
 All participants attended regular meetings where they learned about portion control, healthy eating and overall nutrition. They were also offered one meal-replacement bar or shake per day. 
 
 The only difference between the groups was the proportions of carbohydrate and fat in their diets. 
 
 Those in the low-carbohydrate group were told to eat at no more than 40 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day. (""Digestible carbs"" equals total carbs minus total fiber.) 
 
 Those in the low-fat group were told not to get more than 30 percent of their daily energy from fat and no more than 55 percent of their daily energy from carbohydrates. 
 
 Overall, about four of every five participants were still following the diets 12 months later. 
 
 During that time, the researchers found, people on the low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight and more body fat than those on the low-fat diet. 
 
 The difference in lost weight between the two groups would represent about eight additional pounds. 
 
 Additionally, the researchers saw no increases in total cholesterol or ""bad"" LDL cholesterol between the two groups. Bazzano said that's good news since some thought a low-carbohydrate diet would increase cholesterol levels. 
 
 Those in the low-carbohydrate group had lower levels of fat circulating in their blood and had lower scores on a measure often used to predict the risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. 
 
 ""I thought that was a very striking finding,"" Bazzano said. She added that the score that predicts risk of future heart attacks and strokes was computed after the study was finished and is less reliable than the other risk factors they measured. 
 
 Dr. David Jenkins, who wasn't involved in the study, told Reuters Health, ""This doesn’t look to me to say 'eat all the meats you want to lower your carbohydrates.' That’s just one way to do it."" 
 
 Instead, Jenkins said, people in this study appeared to improve their overall diets. For example, they were eating foods with healthier fats, such as nuts and beans. 
 
 He also said they seemed to eat more fiber and cut down on processed foods with more carbohydrates. 
 
 ""I think it’s another testament to what one can do with a more plant-based diet using the right macronutrient profile,"" said Jenkins of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto and the Keenan Research Centre at St. Michael's Hospital. 
 
 Bazzano agreed that the overall diets improved among the participants and they were encouraged to eat healthier forms of protein like chicken, fish, nuts and beans. 
 
 She also said her team is not sure why people on the low-carbohydrate diets lost more weight and had lower risk factors for heart disease after one year. It's not clear, she added,if there would still be a difference after a longer period. 
 
 SOURCE: bit.ly/1qjI8OG Annals of Internal Medicine, online September 1, 2014.","– If you're trying to lose weight on a low-fat diet and it's not working, here's why. Refined carbohydrates—found in processed foods like white breads, white rice, and pastas—tend to be loaded with sugar, which messes with our metabolisms, making it harder to burn calories. Eating nearly half your calories via healthy fats, on the other hand—think salmon, avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils—has been shown in a recent study to result in twice as much weight loss as seen in those assigned to low-fat diets. ""It's a double-whammy for weight gain,"" one researcher tells NPR. ""We've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body.

What's more, the researchers say there was no increase in total or bad cholesterol between the groups, which has been feared would be the case in higher-fat diets, reports Reuters. It remains unclear precisely why people on lower-carb diets not only lost more weight but had lower heart disease risk factors.

15,"Sprint Nextel Corp. will begin selling the new version of the Apple iPhone in mid-October, people familiar with the matter said, filling a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier's lineup and giving Apple Inc. another sales channel for its popular gadget. 
 
 The timing, however, indicates Apple's new iPhone, which is expected to be called iPhone 5, will hit the market later than expected and too late to contribute to sales in Apple's fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in September. Most observers had expected the device to arrive next month. 
 
 Sprint will get both the new iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4 but it's unclear just how many new subscribers Sprint will be able to reel in come this fall, MarketWatch's Dan Gallagher reports on Markets Hub. (Photo: AP Photo.) 
 
 The deal could help prop up the nation's third-largest carrier and give AT&T Inc. more ammunition in its attempt to win regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of No. 4 U.S. carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. 
 
 Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the two largest wireless carriers, measured by subscribers, will begin selling the phone in mid-October as well, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
 
 Sprint had more than 52 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter, compared with 106 million for Verizon and nearly 99 million for AT&T. 
 
 Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 5 in mid-October, closing a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier's lineup and giving Apple another channel for selling its popular phone. Spencer Ante has details on The News Hub. 
 
 Landing the iPhone is a big win for Sprint, whose results have suffered without being able to sell the trend-setting device. AT&T has relied on versions of the Apple device to drive sales since 2007. This February, Verizon Wireless began selling the iPhone 4. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. 
 
 In the second quarter, Sprint blamed a decline in its contract subscribers on more pronounced ""competitive headwinds,"" most prominently, ""the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone."" 
 
 Sprint will also carry the iPhone 4, starting at the same time, one person familiar with the situation said. 
 
 Richard Doherty, director of the research firm Envisioneering Group, said that the addition of the iPhone would help Sprint retain many of its customers itching to upgrade. The iPhone will also increase foot traffic in Sprint stores, which should help the company to sell high-margin iPhone accessories. ""Sprint needs it,"" said Mr. Doherty. ""There are a lot of families that will embrace the iPhone."" 
 
 That said, the deal could also hurt Sprint by helping AT&T improve its chances of winning approval from regulators for its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, said Marc Ostrau, a partner and co-chair of the antitrust and unfair competition group at law firm Fenwick & West. 
 
 ""It not only is likely to give Sprint a boost but also puts more focus on the increasing importance of device suppliers relative to carriers,"" said Mr. Ostrau. 
 
 Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, said a Sprint iPhone would probably help AT&T's efforts, but he said the impact depends on how much regulators determine the deal curbs AT&T's ability to raise prices without losing too many sales. 
 
 ""The question is how much more competition do you get when you have two rivals rather than one,"" said Mr. Hovenkamp. 
 
 The cellphone business is increasingly driven by hot smartphones, which are growing more sophisticated and expensive. Apple commanded an average of more than $650 apiece for its iPhones last quarter. Carriers subsidize the difference between that cost and the phone's $199 or $299 retail price, hoping to make up the difference with the data plans they sell over the course of two-year contracts customers must sign to get the subsidy. 
 
 Apple created additional leverage for itself by signing exclusive deals when it first launched the iPhone in 2007. In recent years, the company has changed strategy, inking deals with multiple carriers in countries around the world. 
 
 The new iPhone is expected to be similar to the current iPhone 4, but thinner and lighter with an improved digital camera and a new more sophisticated operating system. 
 
 Apple said in June that a new version of its mobile operating system would be available this fall, leading many analysts to conclude that an upgraded iPhone would be introduced at the same time. 
 
 On a July earnings conference call, Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company's September quarter would be affected by ""a future product transition that we are not going to talk about today,"" increasing anticipation. 
 
 While Apple unveiled the iPhone 4 at its June developers' conference last year, its successor wasn't ready in time for this year, according to a person briefed on Apple's product plans. The company then aimed to launch a new iPhone by the end of September, though two people familiar with the situation previously told The Wall Street Journal that the phone could be delayed again if its contract manufacturer couldn't improve its production yield rate.

 Sprint, fighting to turn itself around after its disastrous merger with Nextel last decade, has managed to stem subscriber defections and improve customer service. But it has disappointed investors by failing to add new subscribers more quickly, in part because it competes with rivals that carry Apple's fast-selling phone. 
 
 Verizon Wireless, which cracked AT&T's exclusive U.S. hold on the iPhone this year, has sold 4.5 million of the Apple devices in the first half of 2011. 
 
 AT&T, which is also able to sell a cheaper prior version of the iPhone, has sold 7.2 million this year.

 Write to Joann S. Lublin at joann.lublin@wsj.com ||||| With the iPhone 5 possibly on its way to Sprint Nextel, could the end of its much-loved unlimited-data plan be far behind? 
 
 commentary Once Sprint Nextel gets the iPhone, you can bid farewell to its unlimited-data plan. 
 
 Sprint CEO Dan Hesse, as seen in one of the company's much-played black-and-white television commercials. (Credit: CBS/Sprint) 
 
 If history is any indication, Sprint will have to make some tough decisions, if Apple's blockbuster device starts weighing on its network. It's something the other carriers have done, and it's part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption. 
 
 After suffering through years of heavy bandwidth usage from iPhone users, AT&T; relented and switched to a tiered pricing plan last year. It only took Verizon Wireless a few months after launching its version of the iPhone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps. 
 
 Sprint, which The Wall Street Journal reported today will be getting the iPhone 5 at the same time as AT&T; and Verizon in October, will likely follow the same path. 
 
 I have no first-hand knowledge of Sprint's thinking on its successful--but taxing--offer of an all-you-can-eat data plan for its smartphones. A Sprint representative wasn't immediately available to answer my questions. 
 
 But I do know that networks aren't fundamentally different from each other, despite the marketing jargon and hype that surrounds them. Sprint doesn't have any more capacity than Verizon and AT&T.; In fact, it may be in a worse position now because its unlimited-data offer is unique in the market, likely attracting the heaviest of users. 
 
 The carriers' switch to tiered plans doesn't include existing unlimited-data customers, who have had the option to be grandfathered into an unlimited plan. You can see the strain the grandfathering is putting on the carriers, with both AT&T; and Verizon switching to language in their service agreements that allow them to throttle, or choke off, the connection speed when a user exceeds a certain threshold of data consumption. 
 
 Sprint is in a touchy spot because it has positioned itself as the unlimited carrier. Ads talk about the company's truly limitless plans, and Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been featured on commercials deriding competitors' actions such as throttling. 
 
 As I've written, Verizon's decision to switch to a capped plan has been a boon for Sprint. The carrier is the only remaining company to offer a truly unlimited-data plan, a rare marketing and competitive edge outside of cheaper prices. Even Sprint's prepaid arm, Virgin Mobile, has decided to employ throttling. 
 
 But all good things have to come to an end. Speaking to a roundtable of bloggers and reporters last month, Hesse acknowledged that data traffic could eventually be an issue. 
 
 ""Nothing's a guarantee that it's forever,"" he said at the time. 
 
 For Sprint, the choice is a trade-off: keep the unlimited-data plan and spur additional customer growth, or cut back on the plans and ease the need to invest in more capital for the network. Its decision may indicate whether it is favoring the consumer or Wall Street. 
 
 When I wrote about Sprint eventually dropping the unlimited-data plan, analysts gave it a year to 18 months before a change would happen. But with the iPhone becoming available to Sprint customers, that timetable could be accelerated. Thanks to its more affordable data plans, Sprint has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals--roughly half of its total customers. 
 
 While it has gotten used to dealing with the bandwidth-intensive Android phone, Sprint may be in for another pounding, once more customers start upgrading their basic phones for the iPhone. 
 
 And even if the iPhone isn't significantly more data-hungry than its Android counterparts, Sprint may use the iPhone's reputation as an excuse to close off the unlimited-data spigot. 
 
 So what does that mean for customers? If the iPhone does come out for Sprint, hop on an unlimited-data plan while you can (and thus get grandfathered in). The plan may not be around much longer.","– The iPhone 5 will be available on Sprint's network as well as Verizon's and AT&T's when the new phone is launched, insiders tell the Wall Street Journal. The device will hit the market in mid-October, not next month as many had expected, the sources say. The iPhone 5 deal will provide a major boost for the nation's third-largest carrier, whose bottom line had suffered without the ability to sell iPhones, analysts say. The deal, however, could end up backfiring on Sprint if it improves AT&T's chances of getting the green light from regulators to buy T-Mobile USA. Verizon ditched its unlimited plans not long after it launched its version of the iPhone 4 earlier this year, notes Roger Cheng at CNET, who recommends that Sprint users hop on unlimited data plans now to get ""grandfathered in"" before the Sprint iPhone arrives.",<pad> Sprint's sales.</s>,0.017857142168367375,0.0,0.017857142168367375
16,"Neil Patrick Harris' hot streak as the 21st century awards-show answer to Johnny Carson hit a few speed bumps with this year's wildly hit-or-miss television honors. 
 
 Jeff Daniels beat out Bryan Cranston. Bobby Cannavale trumped Aaron Paul. Tony Hale mopped the floor with the Modern Family guys. And Stephen Colbert finally nudged out Jon Stewart for variety-show supremacy. So with so many unexpected wins, why was the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards telecast such a bloated bore? Chalk it up to tonal inconsistency? Misconceived production numbers? Too many protracted pretaped segments at the expense of spontaneity? An overload of solemnity? 
 
 Perhaps Don Cheadle inadvertently hit it on the head during a look back a half-century to the momentous events of 1963, when he acknowledged “television’s active role in allowing us to mourn collectively and begin to heal.” That’s a noble sentiment in the intended context of the John F. Kennedy assassination. But in such a moribund ceremony, any mention of mourning felt awkwardly appropriate. It didn’t take the Breaking Bad meth dancers -- yes, really -- to point up the uncomfortable paradox of television’s best being celebrated in a night of spectacularly messy TV. 
 
 PHOTOS: Emmys' Best and Worst Moments 
 
 As the man in the firing line, Neil Patrick Harris will likely cop a lot of flak. But with so many blundering producing decisions intruding on his limited time at the podium, the host didn’t really stand a chance. 
 
 Harris has four lauded turns as Tony Awards emcee under his belt, plus a previous gig fronting the Emmys in 2009. He knows what he’s doing. His insouciant irreverence hit the mark in an intro segment in which he binge-watched the entire TV season. Ditto when his opening monologue was hijacked by previous hosts (Jimmy Kimmel, Jane Lynch, Jimmy Fallon, Conan O’Brien) and by front-row hecklers Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, demanding that he strip down and start twerking. Making that sabotage part of the master plan of Kevin Spacey, in character as House of Cards’ reptilian Frank Underwood, was a droll touch. And somehow Harris’ humor and charm failed to provide much glue. (Truth be told, he was also part of the producing team, which makes him far from blameless.) 
 
 The expected opening song-and-dance number failed to materialize until midshow. By the time it did, the mood had been so thoroughly flattened that Harris, 16 back-up dancers, Nathan Fillion and Sarah Silverman faced an uphill battle to milk much amusement out of the routine glitz of “The Number in the Middle of the Show.” Even worse was the choreography segment, with a faux-reality setup leading to thematic dance numbers for each of the drama nominees -- a throwback to the good old, bad old days when Debbie Allen choreographed the Oscars. 
 
 PHOTOS: Emmys Red Carpet Arrivals 
 
 When Harris’ How I Met Your Mother castmates turned up in a pretaped mock-infomercial for The Ryan Seacrest Center for Excessive Hosting Disorder, dragging in Arsenio Hall as part of their intervention, the irony was agonizing. 
 
 Too often, such labored filler segments merely ate up time, meaning the award recipients were played off almost as soon as they began speaking. Shorter acceptance speeches normally are a good thing, a memo that Nurse Jackie winner Merritt Wever appeared to have gotten with her succinct: “Thank you so much. I gotta go. Bye.” But a few more discursive comments might have helped stave off the weird pall that hung over much of the ceremony. 
 
 In one inspired bit early on, Hale returned to the stage soon after his supporting actor in a comedy win for Veep, sycophantically flanking his “boss,” Julia Louis-Dreyfus, when she was honored for the same show. Cutting to their co-star Anna Chlumsky madly texting in the audience only made the joke funnier. Michael Douglas also scored some laughs with his innuendo-laden acceptance speech for Behind the Candelabra, acknowledging that the movie was a “two-hander” and giving his co-star Matt Damon the choice of “the bottom or the top” for his half of the award. Gracious remarks by class acts such as James Cromwell and Ellen Burstyn were like invigorating breaths of fresh air -- likewise the welcome appearances of Bob Newhart, who showed that less is more.

 But every moment of genuine levity had to contend with another deep plunge into self-important sobriety. Spreading the “In Memoriam” salutes throughout the show was a large part of that problem, laying such a thick carpet of gloom that it made much of Harris’ material seem smug. 
 
 During the runup to Sunday’s ceremony, news that Glee star Cory Monteith was to be given a special tribute prompted some discontent, suggesting that, by contrast, lumping such iconic faces as Jack Klugman and Larry Hagman into the collective obit was doing those TV veterans a disservice. But it was impossible not to be moved by the heartfelt sincerity of Jane Lynch’s salute to her late Glee co-star. 
 
 Other tributes included Michael J. Fox’s bow to Family Ties creator Gary David Goldberg; Robin Williams’ nod to fellow comedian Jonathan Winters, with whom he worked on Mork & Mindy; Edie Falco’s tearful farewell to her Sopranos husband James Gandolfini; and most affecting of all, Rob Reiner’s loving words for his All in the Family mother-in-law, Jean Stapleton. In a year of countless sad losses for television, the Emmys clearly set out to acknowledge the passing of key figures who touched different generations. The intention was honorable, even if some major names ended up seeming like also-rans. But the complete absence of clips from either the standalone tributes or the group acknowledgement robbed them of emotional resonance.

 The 1963 remembrance was too rushed to have much impact, playing like a promo for a more interesting PBS special. The first-ever African-American Emmy acting nominee, Diahann Carroll, appeared onstage with this year’s contender Kerry Washington to acknowledge how far television had come in terms of racial inclusiveness. But again, this gesture was more symbolic than meaningful. 
 
 In the evening’s most anticipated musical interlude, Elton John donned one of his old glittery Captain Fantastic jackets to pay tribute to Liberace. But the choice of a forgettable new song with only the most tenuous connection to the Behind the Candelabra subject made this another black hole in a ceremony littered with them. 
 
 The big drag at the Emmys has always been the deja vu factor of the same winners year after year. Claire Danes again? Jim Parsons again? And despite edgier contenders in Louie, Girls and Veep, another best comedy win for Modern Family was gruesomely inevitable. Given that USA is about to start syndicating season-one reruns of that sitcom -- the last time the show’s writing really excelled -- the ho-hum award felt somehow right. 
 
 This was an Emmy telecast so plodding, lifeless and just plain glum that even the overdue best drama win for Breaking Bad failed to provide a lift at the end of the show. ||||| ""Modern Family"" creator Steven Levitan summed up the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards telecast when he accepted another outstanding comedy award for the show.""This may be the saddest Emmys of all time, but we could not be happier,"" he said.The CBS telecast, hosted with gusto by Neil Patrick Harris, was smothered by five ""in memoriam"" tributes to individuals as well as a montage late in the telecast. It was, in a word, a bummer.Harris tried to bring up the energy with jokes and a mid-broadcast song-and-dance number called ""The Number in the Middle of the Show."" But nothing seemed to help. Every time the show got moving, a tribute cast a pall over the proceedings.Most of the presenter banter was strained and only a few acceptance speeches drew laughs. Here are the night's best moments, which were few. (Click through the gallery at top of page for images from the telecast.)Accepting the variety series Emmy for ""The Colbert Report,"" Colbert cracked, ""It's a cliche to say it's an honor just to be nominated. It's more than that; it's also a lie. This is way better."" When he accepted the writing award, he said, ""Wow, the Emmys are so good this year."" If only that were true.In a pre-taped howler, the cast of ""How I Met Your Mother"" do a commercial for the Ryan Seacrest Center for Excessive Hosting, where they send Neil Patrick Harris because he is suffering from Excessive Hosting Disorder.When Julia Louis-Dreyfus accepted her award for ""Veep."" fellow winner and costar Tony Hale followed her to the stage, standing behind her just like his ""Veep"" character does in the show. He whispered names and comments into her ear so she could complete her speech.Merritt Wever, a surprise supporting actress winner for ""Nurse Jackie,"" was rendered pretty much speechless, thus delivering the night's most honest and brief acceptance. ""Thank you so much,"" she said. ""I gotta go. Bye.""Amy Poehler and Tina Fey show why they are the funniest ladies of the moment, again. During Harris' opening skit in which past hosts offered him advice, the women cat call him from the audience with comments like,""Take your pants off! And twerk it!"" When he said that would be degrading, Poehler responded, ""It might be degrading, but we would be de-grateful.""Diahann Carroll, who was the first African-American to win in Emmy way back when, showed she's still a pro. ""It's been such a long time since I've been standing in this place, I don't know what to do,"" Carroll said. ""But the men are much more beautiful than when I was doing television. I don't know where you came from, but I'm very happy to see you."" ||||| First, our apologies: we may have hyped this year’s Emmy Awards as a lighter Sunday-night-programming alternative to Breaking Bad. Aside from the trophies, and the odd sexual-innuendo-tinged acceptance speech from Michael Douglas, however, the vibe inside the Nokia Theater’s Emmydome was not that upbeat. (To quote Patton Oswalt: “That was one soul-crushing slab of televised darkness. Over on cable, however, @BreakingBad_AMC was amazing.”) How could it be, with the steady stream of in-memoriam segments that stopped just long enough for a series of less relevant downers including, but not limited to, a Beatles cover performed by Carrie Underwood, a U.S.-history lesson from Don Cheadle, and a tribute to Liberace by Elton John? It was all so torturous that when Bob Newhart interrupted the downcast proceeding, we don’t even remember what for, Al Pacino—looking as though he had just roused himself from a two-hour slumber—led the audience in a standing ovation, as if to say, “Yay for the living!” 
 
 
 
 But somewhere in all of that Emmy muckety-muck, there were some genuinely brilliant surprises. The first being Merritt Wever’s very deserved, but very unexpected, win in the supporting-actress-in-a-comedy category for her work on Nurse Jackie. Up against Modern Family favorites Sofía Vergara and Julie Bowen, the young actress was so shocked by the win that all she could mutter at the podium was, “Thanks so much. I gotta go, bye.” A close second in the awesome-acceptance-speech department came from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who collected her comedic-actress Emmy with Veep co-star (and supporting comedic-actor winner) Tony Hale in tow. Assuming the role of Gary, Louis-Dreyfus’s aide on the HBO series, Hale stood behind her while she accepted her Emmy to hold her bag (a recurring Veep joke) and remind her to thank her family. 
 
 Joining Wever with their own surprise wins were Jeff Daniels in the dramatic-actor category (where he was up against such heavy-hitting nominees as Mad Men’s Jon Hamm, Breaking Bad’s Bryan Cranston, and Homeland’s Damian Lewis) and Boardwalk Empire’s Bobby Cannavale in the dramatic-supporting-actor race (which featured Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul, Homeland’s Mandy Patinkin, and Game of Thrones’ Peter Dinklage). Like last year, Modern Family won the best-comedy-series title, and Claire Danes took the best-dramatic-actress award for Homeland. In groundbreaking developments, Netflix secured its first Emmy, for direction of a drama series, which went to David Fincher for House of Cards. Michael Douglas predictably took the best-actor-in-a-miniseries-or-movie trophy for his portrayal of Liberace in HBO’s Behind the Candelabra. Explaining that he wanted to split his award with co-star Matt Damon, who played Liberace’s real-life lover Scott Thorson, Douglas joked, “Matt, you really deserve half of this. So do you want the bottom or the top?” 
 
 
 
 Breaking Bad won two awards—supporting actress in a drama series for Anna Gunn and the top drama title at the end of the night. Sadly for Game of Thrones fans, this meant that neither Emilia Clarke nor the fantasy show won in their nominated categories. Similarly defeated was Mad Men, which unfathomably failed to clinch a single award tonight. While on the subject of injustices, it seems unfair to tease Emmy viewers with several minutes’ worth of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler—who appeared early in the telecast to heckle host Neil Patrick Harris—only to leave us with three relentlessly depressing hours of programming. 
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, it bears noting that Neil Patrick Harris—a consummate pro—expertly M.C.’d the proceedings, brightening them up wherever he could. Unfortunately for him, Emmy producers had a somewhat dour agenda for the evening, which left this viewer, at least, feeling like one of the night’s biggest losers. ||||| We don’t ask much of the Primetime Emmy Awards. Nobody ever gets one of these three-hour statuette dispensaries completely right, but the Emmys always seem as though they’d be the easiest of all the awards shows to pull off — mostly because the likelihood of culturally disruptive twerking is very, very low, which means the Emmys are the awards show no one ever remembers 18 hours later. 
 
 So what happened Sunday night during CBS’s anemic and often awkward Emmys telecast, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris? (Or let me put it another way: I had to next-day “Breaking Bad” for this?) 
 
 Everyone’s favorite messed-up meth saga did at last win the best drama award, so the night wasn’t a total wash, but all those highfalutin theses about the Netflix-y future of television failed to materialize. Claire Danes won lead actress (drama) for Showtime’s “Homeland” for the second year in a row, and, inexplicably, Jeff Daniels won lead actor (drama) for HBO’s “The Newsroom.” 
 
 “Modern Family” won best comedy series for what seems like the squillionth time, but it is really just the fourth. HBO’s Washington-based comedy “Veep” took two acting awards — Tony Hale for supporting actor, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus for lead actress the second straight year. And Anna Gunn won for supporting actress (drama) for AMC’s “Breaking Bad.” 
 
 That’s most of the news, now for the snooze, starting with a dreary opening sketch that featured Harris locking himself in a multi-screen chamber to binge the entire 2012-13 season of every television show in a matter of minutes.

 Once onstage, Harris was joined by former Emmys hosts (Jimmy Kimmel, Jane Lynch, Jimmy Fallon and Conan O’Brien), who needled him in one of those tiresome meta-routines in which all the comedy is directed at the existence of the show itself, in real time. The joke just got staler when an unamused Kevin Spacey, the star of Netflix’s hit “House of Cards,” turned and addressed the camera as House Majority Whip Francis Underwood, his fictional character from the show. 
 
 Later, Harris’s “How I Met Your Mother” co-stars confronted him in an intervention for “EHD” (excessive hosting disorder), treatable only at the “Ryan Seacrest Center for Excessive Hosting.” 
 
 Halfway through the evening, Harris finally brought out the jaunty song-and-dance routines, the main symptom of his EHD, with a number called “The Number in the Middle of the Show.” (Sample lyric: “The Emmy Awards are three hours long / Now there’s three minutes less to go.”) One can’t imagine a flashier way to demonstrate that Hollywood’s awards-show writers desperately need to think of a way to tell jokes that aren’t about telling jokes; to stage a show that’s not only about the show. 
 
 The best line of the evening came very early on from Merritt Wever, who seemed so shocked at winning the supporting actress Emmy for a comedy show (“Nurse Jackie”) that she went with her flusteredness and said: “I gotta go, bye.” 
 
 The rest of us (well, some of us) gotta stay, alas, in a listless position on the couch while the Emmys poked along as flatly as possible. The banter had no flair for comedy. The tributes — including short monologues from Robin Williams, Rob Reiner, Michael J. Fox and Jane Lynch (honoring the recent deaths of comic actor Jonathan Winters, “All in the Family’s” Jean Stapleton, producer Gary David Goldberg and “Glee’s” Cory Monteith) sometimes seemed stiff and, most curiously, clip-less. 
 
 Lynch said that Monteith was “a beautiful soul. He was not perfect, which many of us here can relate to. . . . Tonight we remember Cory for all he was and mourn the loss of what he could have been.” That was supposed to be one of the evening’s most moving moments, and it only sort of was. Edie Falco also encountered a similar struggle in a tribute to “The Sopranos” star James Gandolfini, trying to make what was on the teleprompter sound as authentic as the pain she so clearly feels at losing a friend. 
 
 More strangeness: Elton John performed a song that he said was a tribute to Liberace, which is topical because of all the nominations for HBO’s “Behind the Candelabra,” a film didn’t exactly leave everyone who saw it with a warm feeling about the flamboyant pianist. (“Behind the Candelabra” went on to win three big awards, for best miniseries/movie, best director for Steven Soderbergh and best actor for its star Michael Douglas, who tried to perk up his acceptance speech with jokes about gay sex.) And somewhere in this now-blurry Emmys night, Carrie Underwood performed the Beatles’ song “Yesterday,” as a tribute to all the things that happened during or close to the year 1963 (the March on Washington; the John F. Kennedy assassination), because . . .? Because the world is round, it blows my mind.

 “The Emmys are so good this year,” Stephen Colbert deadpanned as he and his “Colbert Report” crew accepted the award for variety series writing. (The show also won best variety series. Another victory for the “finally” list.) “Modern Family” creator Steven Levitan also took a dig at the show while accepting the best comedy series award at the evening’s end: “This may be the saddest Emmys of all time, but we could not be happier,” he said. 
 
 So, to sum up: An awards show filled with skits about how bad awards shows are gave awards to people who talked about how bad the show turned out, while everyone on Twitter had decided that hours earlier. These days, that’s entertainment.

 A dime made in 1873 has cost someone a pretty penny: It sold for $1.6 million at auction. 
 
 An anonymous bidder won the pristine coin, said Chris Napolitano, president of Stack's Bowers Galleries, which auctioned it during an American Numismatic Association convention. With a 15 percent buyer's fee tacked on, the final price for the coin was $1.84 million, he said. 
 
 The rare coin was minted in Carson City, Nev., during a one-day run of dimes. 
 
 ""Generally speaking, in the coin auction business, you might get a couple of people fighting each other"" as they bid, he said Friday. ""On this one, we had four or five buyers over a million dollars. We had a fair amount of buyers pursuing it."" 
 
 The 1873-CC ""No Arrows"" Liberty Seated dime was auctioned Thursday night. It's part of the Battle Born Collection, which contained one of every coin struck in Carson City before the mint there closed in 1893. 
 
 All 111 pieces were auctioned off Thursday night, fetching a total of nearly $10 million.

 Stack's Bowers: http://stacksbowers.com/ ||||| Add up their face value, and the 111 rare coins in the ""Battle Born Collection"" amount to under $600. 
 
 But throw in their lure to coin enthusiasts - each struck in the Carson City Mint between 1870 and 1893 with the most prized coin the only known 1873 ""No Arrows"" Seated Liberty dime to exist - and the price tag soars. 
 
 Their owner, an anonymous Nevadan, could earn $11 million-$15 million at auction next week in Philadelphia, and a Reno coin dealer assisting him in the process says it will be a once-in-a-lifetime event. 
 
 ""This is my Olympic moment,"" Rusty Goe, owner of Southgate Coins, said Tuesday of the upcoming sale, part of the Rarities Night Auction at the American Numismatic Association's World's Fair of Money Convention. ""This is the biggest event that's ever happened to me in my 30-year career as a coin collector."" 
 
 Goe serves as a paid consultant to the collection's owner, whom Goe refers to only as ""Mr. Battle Born"" after Nevada's state motto. 
 
 Until the coins are sold individually at auction, they remain the only complete collection of coins made in the Carson City Mint, Goe said. They represent each of the 111 different date-and-denomination combinations issued from the Mint before it closed in 1893 in what is now the home of the Nevada State Museum. 
 
 The coins range from $5, $10 and $20 gold pieces to silver dollars, half-dollars, quarters, 20-cent pieces and, what Goe describes as the ""king coin,"" the dime featuring a seated liberty figure with a crucial feature: no arrows on each side of the 1873 stamp. 
 
 As the only known survivor of 12,400 coins minted, Goe said, it alone could fetch anywhere from $1.5 million to $4 million. 
 
 He should know: He once owned the dime, he said, buying it in 2004 for $891,250 and later selling it to the current owner for $1 million. 
 
 ""It's the show-stopper, the cornerstone of the collection,"" Goe said. ""I got a good deal on it and I passed a good deal on to Mr. Battle Born."" 
 
 The auction's success could be affected by potential buyers' confidence at the moment with market conditions, Goe said, adding, ""We just won't know for sure until then. We'll see how close we come to our pre-sale estimates."" 
 
 Either way, Goe hopes to use the event as a showcase for Nevada and the Carson City Mint's opening at the height of the Comstock Lode era. 
 
 He's already convinced Stack's Bowers Galleries of Irvine, Calif., which will put on the auction, to print a separate catalog on the Battle Born Collection in addition to the main publication for participants. 
 
 And Goe has written articles for Coin World magazine and helped Stack's Bowers organize a seven-city tour of the collection over the past year leading up to next Thursday's auction. 
 
 He also said a bit of historic irony has not been lost: The Philadelphia Mint, the nation's first opened in 1792, opposed creating a Carson City branch when the issue was debated in Congress in the 1860s. 
 
 ""They said, why do we want to put a mint in that heathen territory, a Wild West area like that? So for this one night, Carson City will steal the show from the Philadelphia Mint,"" he said.","– A one-of-a-kind dime minted in 1873 sold for $1.6 million at a Philadelphia auction last night, reports AP.

Another 110 coins also went up for auction, one of each coin minted in Carson City before its facility closed in 1893. Total haul: $10 million.

18,"And, contrary to popular belief, people in open or polyamorous relationships aren’t more sexually satisfied: 71% of people in polyamorous or open relationships are satisfied with their sex life compared to 82% of people in monogamous relationships and 80% of people who are married, in civil unions or partnerships. The least sexually satisfied people are those who are single and looking for a relationship; only 40% are satisfied. Single people are also more likely to choose not to divulge information about their sex life. 
 
 
 
 The survey also shows that general satisfaction increases with age among men but stays relatively stable among women. However, for both men and women, 25-30 year olds are most likely to report that they are ‘very satisfied’ with their sex life.

 Header image by Charlie Foster ||||| ANN ARBOR, MI - While monogamous relationships are considered by many to be the cornerstone of love and happiness, a new University of Michigan study indicates that those in consensual open relationships are just as satisfied. 
 
 The study, led by UM Associate Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies Terri Conley, showed that heterosexuals in consensual open relationships reported high levels of satisfaction and trust, as well as low levels of jealousy. 
 
 
 
 ""Overall, the outcomes for monogamous and consensual nonmonogamous participants were the same - indicating no net benefit of one relationship style over another,"" said Conley, in a news release. 
 
 
 
 Conley and colleagues conducted analyses of different relationships among participants older than age 25. The sample included 2,124 people - including 1,507 individuals in monogamous relationships and 617 individuals in committed non-monogamous relationships. 
 
 The group rated relationship components: satisfaction, commitment, trust, jealousy and passionate love, which is the intense love feeling often described in new relationships. 
 
 
 
 Researchers found no differences between monogamous and consensual nonmonogamous participants in terms of satisfaction and passionate love. 
 
 Furthermore, levels of jealousy were lower and trust was higher among those engaged in committed non-monogamous relationships. 
 
 Another finding differed from people's assumptions that those in non-monogamous relationships do not care about each other enough to be happy in their primary relationship. The study, however, showed that an individual had more satisfaction, trust, commitment and passionate love in their primary mate than in their secondary relationship. 
 
 The study did show that people in open relationships generally reported somewhat poorer relational functioning than monogamous individuals. Individuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied and less committed to their relationship than their monogamous counterparts. 
 
 They also reported lower levels of passionate love and fewer jealous cognitions than monogamous people and also scored marginally lower on the index of behavioral jealousy than monogamous individuals. 
 
 The findings appear in the current issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science. 
 
 ||||| Sex is a big part of most romances, whether a marriage or a more experimental union. A recent survey of Europeans shows that people in the most sexually liberated partnerships aren’t having the best time. Monogamous couples reported that they were the most sexually satisfied of all the groups in a large, representative survey conducted in March 2017. 
 
 Among the 1,885 people who said they were in monogamous relationships, 82% reported that they were broadly satisfied with their sex life. That compared to 80% of people in a marriage, civil union or other legal partnership, while 71% of people in open or polyamorous relationships said they were fulfilled. 
 
 The survey, conducted by Dalia, a Berlin-based research company, included over 11,000 people from the 28 countries in the European Union aged 14-65, though for the purposes of reporting they then excluded those aged under 18. 
 
 The findings echo US research that showed that people with young kids had the most sex of all Americans. People who live together (as couples with children often do) have readier access to sex than those in relationships who don’t live together. The EU survey only found 275 people, or 2.5% of the total, who said they were in open relationships. 
 
 Age and gender also affect sex-life satisfaction. Men overall reported a slight increase in satisfaction as age increased, while women’s satisfaction remained stable. For both genders, the highest peak was between the ages of 25 and 30. And though not every country in the EU provided enough respondents to produce a statistically significant finding, some that did showed marked differences. Spain proved to be the most sexually satisfied country with 41% of people saying they were “very satisfied” with their sex lives, while in Germany that number was 38%. In Poland only 23% said they were ”very satisfied,” compared to 28% in Italy and 29% in both the UK and France. 
 
 Opening up a relationship can be about more than sex. Advocates talk (paywall) about the deep trust forged by letting one’s partner have other relationships, and the intellectual stimulation and support gained from multiple romantic connections. But the surveys indicate that multiple partners may well not trump one really great one in the bedroom department.","– Feel like monogamy is keeping you from an exciting sex life? Take note: An open relationship, with the potential for more sexual partners, does not necessarily mean you'll be more sexually satisfied. That's according to a survey of more than 11,000 people from 28 European countries, aged 18 to 65. In the survey conducted by German research company Dalia in March, 82% of monogamous couples and 80% of married couples reported that they were sexually satisfied, compared to 71% of couples in an open or polyamorous relationship and fewer than half of singles, reports Quartz. Other than singles who are ""looking,"" those in open relationships were actually the most likely to be unsatisfied sexually. Some 22% said they weren't sexually satisfied, compared to 12% of married participants and 11% of monogamous respondents. Interestingly, a University of Michigan survey of some 2,000 people over 25, published in March, found heterosexuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied with their relationship overall than those in monogamous relationships, reported Michigan Live. On the flip side, though, those in polyamorous relationships reported having higher levels of trust and lower levels of jealousy than their monogamous counterparts. That left researchers to conclude that there is ""no net benefit of one relationship style over another.""

19,"Gunfire rang out at the Forysth County Courthouse Friday after a man opened fire on a deputy, injuring him in the leg. The gunman was shot and killed a short time later. 
 
 
 
 Forsyth County Sheriff Duane Piper said the shooter, Dennis Marx, walked into Forsyth County Administration Building on East Main Street at about 10:30 a.m. and opened fire. He was armed with an assault rifle, according to authorities. Piper said Marx threw stop sticks on the road so that cars could not approach. 
 
 
 
 Marx was approached by deputy Daniel Rush who he then shot in the leg, Piper confirmed. 
 
 “The only way I can describe it is in a frontal assault on our court house,” Piper said. 
 
 Piper said Rush was taken to North Fulton Hospital in Roswell with non-life threatening injuries. 
 
 “From the video, it looks like he saw that deputy, swerved to try and run over the deputy. The deputy engaged him. He was shooting at Mr. Marx in the vehicle, Mr. Marx was shooting through the windshield at the deputy,” Piper said. 
 
 
 
 The SWAT team, which was on its way to a separate incident, arrived at the courthouse within 37 seconds. Marx was shot dead in front of the court house a short time later. 
 
 None of the other deputies involved in the incident were injured. 
 
 
 
 Piper described Marx’s home as a “bomb.” When officers entered the home Friday night, they found pipe bombs and other incendiary devices but none were booby-trapped to go off. 
 
 
 
 The sheriff said evidence showed that Marx had not been living at his home for more than a week and instead had been staying at a hotel. Piper said it will take hours to clear the courthouse. 
 
 “It's kind of creepy to find out a whacko lives in your neighborhood,” Jane Bizzell said. She along with others was not allowed into the neighborhood. Neighbor Dorothy Varano who lived up the street from Marx said police visited her home a number of times throughout the day and told her to stay indoors for her safety. 
 
 But learning the house was filled with explosives made Browning wonder about her now deceased neighbor. 
 
 “I know a lot of people build up a lot of hatred, but I think he built up a double dose to do what he did,” said Margaret Browning. 
 
 The gunman's attorney told Channel 2 she was representing him until Thursday, when she withdrew because he was unsatisfied with her negotiating skills. He was due in court on Friday for marijuana and firearms charges. The attorney said the man was a gun buyer and trader. 
 
 “His emotional state was very fragile. He was very sensitive, very, very, scared. He has no prior criminal history. He was obsessed with not going to jail,” said Marx’s former attorney Ann Shafer. 
 
 The area is still closed as police investigate and drivers are asked to avoid the area of downtown Cumming until further notice. 
 
 Rush posted on his Facebook page that he was “ok.” 
 
 One construction worker was just feet away when the shooting happened. Gary Womack described the situation as intense.

 Sheriff: Carrying flexible handcuffs, he appeared intent on taking over courthouse 
 
 Dennis Marx wore body armor and a gas mask. He brandished an assault rifle, an assortment of grenades, ""all kinds of ammunition"" and even used his silver Nissan SUV as a weapon of sorts, according to authorities. The 48-year-old man toted his own water supply and flexible handcuffs, presumably to corral hostages once he got inside the north Georgia courthouse. 
 
 As Forsyth County Sheriff Duane Piper said, ""He came prepared to do this."" 
 
 But Dennis Marx never even made it inside. 
 
 A nearly three-minute long gunfight Friday ended with Marx dead, after being confronted by a swarm of law enforcement officers. 
 
 They seemingly came from everywhere -- from the jail across the street, as part of a SWAT team that happened to be nearby and even inside the courthouse where they busted out windows in order to get more angles to target the attacked.

 Piper singled out one officer in particular -- a veteran sheriff's deputy who first confronted Marx, who then tried to run the deputy over -- for his vital part in deterring the attacker. Shot twice in the leg, the deputy was the only person wounded despite what the sheriff called ""a full frontal assault."" 
 
 ""It was very close to being a major catastrophe,"" Piper said. ""The deputy that was shot ... averted what, I think, would have been a lot more deaths."" 
 
 Swift, significant response to attack 
 
 Marx was supposed to be at the Forsyth County Courthouse in Cumming. Court documents show he faced 11 felony charges -- 10 of them related to the manufacture, possession and sale of illicit drugs, including marijuana, plus one count of having a firearm while in the commission of a felony -- dating back to August 2011. 
 
 According to the sheriff's office, he was expected to enter a plea Friday before Chief Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Bagley. 
 
 Needless to say, he never made it. 
 
 Instead, around 10 a.m. Friday, Marx drove up to the courthouse, threw out ""homemade spike strips"" to delay any police response, and tried to run over the deputy, Piper said. 
 
 The deputy -- a 30-year veteran whose duties include canvassing the scene outside the courthouse -- opened fire, and Marx returned fire through his windshield. 
 
 He didn't stop with bullets. According to the sheriff, Marx tossed tear gas grenades, smoke grenades and pepper spray grenades -- something he could do more easily with his gas mask strapped on. 
 
 Despite this barrage of weapons, the sheriff's deputy was able to distract Marx, to slow him. Even a little delay made a big difference, as officers armed with assault rifles came over from the jail across the street.

 A SWAT team pulled up about 30 seconds into the firefight and engaged the attacker, according to Piper. The sheriff initially estimated the whole thing took 90 seconds but, after watching more video, he doubled that time. 
 
 However long it lasted, it ended with Marx dead of multiple gunshot wounds. 
 
 With eight officers opening fire at one point, authorities don't yet know which one of them fired the fatal shot. 
 
 'He was there to occupy the courthouse' 
 
 Afterward, the wounded deputy -- identified by local media as James Daniel Rush -- was transported to a local hospital. 
 
 There, the officer had surgery for fractures to his fibula and tibia in the lower right leg, injuries Piper said weren't life-threatening. 
 
 But his colleagues still had to work to do. They went to Marx's home in Cumming, a small city about 35 northeast of downtown Atlanta, with every expectation that it was booby trapped. 
 
 As Piper said: ""Last time we were at the home, we were suspicious because it had been booby trapped before."" 
 
 Once they finally made their way in and cleared the house, they found homemade explosives, according to a law enforcement source. It wasn't clear whether those were attempted booby traps. 
 
 A preliminary investigation found that Marx hadn't been in his Cumming home for about 10 days. Besides that, little is known about him beyond that he began working at the Transportation Security Administration in October 2002, according to a U.S. official, and left either the next year or in 2004. 
 
 The sheriff said Friday that he and others weren't ready yet to discuss Marx's motive or his thinking. 
 
 That said, Piper said it was evident that Marx ""came prepared to stay a while."" 
 
 ""We don't know who he was coming to the courthouse for, but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him,"" said the sheriff. ""We have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse.""

 Residents started waiting up at night, keeping an eye out more during the day, and sharing messages on social media. 
 
 Then came a break in the case. The police said two boys, 16 and 17, were arrested and charged on Thursday with criminal damaging of an inflatable Santa on one property in the Colerain Township neighborhood. 
 
 “This was a mini-spree of criminal damaging,” Chief Mark C. Denney of the Colerain police department said in an interview. “It put a negative spin on everything going on in that neighborhood.” ||||| COLERAIN TOWNSHIP, Ohio (WKRC) - Police say that they have arrested two teens after some Christmas decorations were vandalized. 
 
 The Christmas decorations that were put up early in September were meant for 2-year-old Brody Allen, who has a rare form of brain cancer and isn't expected to make it to Christmas. 
 
 Brody's neighbors decided to put up decorations so that Christmas could come to Brody. Since the news broke, many have joined in on the cause and donated decorations and lights so that Brody's neighborhood could become a beacon of Christmas spirit. 
 
 ""I really appreciate everyone coming by, dropping off stuff, sending gifts and letters. Brody loves opening letters. We all enjoy it; it's like a little Christmas every day for him,"" said Brody's brother, Andrew Allen. 
 
 
 
 Sometime after the decorations were put up, it was noticed that a few of the decorations were vandalized. Some of the inflatables had been slashed. Several other incidents were reported. There were reportedly repeat victims. 
 
 But one neighbor, George Reiter has a security camera and caught one of the incidents on video. The Colerain Police Department were able to track down and apprehend two teens, 16 and 17 years old, who confessed to several of the incidents. 
 
 Both suspects were taken to the Juvenile Detention Center and charges have been filed. They're charged with curfew violations and criminal damaging. One of the teens is also charged with fleeing police, and the other teen has three outstanding warrants for other charges. 
 
 Many people have heard Brody's story and are joining #TeamBrody. The Bengals running backs posted a video of themselves wishing Brody a Merry Christmas and radio station WARM 98 will be playing Christmas music on their station for the 2-year-old.

21,"TAMPA — Like many parents of toddlers, Nicole and Chad Oulson didn't get many opportunities to spend quality time alone. 
 
 So when both managed to get a rare day off work, they left their 22-month-old daughter with a sitter and went to a movie. 
 
 ""I was just so excited and looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life,"" said Nicole Oulson, who met the tall ex-Navy sailor while the two worked at a Jacksonville bank about 14 years ago. 
 
 The Oulsons were at the Cobb Grove 16 in Wesley Chapel on Jan. 13 for a matinee of Lone Survivor when a man behind them became agitated because Chad Oulson was texting on his phone during previews. 
 
 Authorities say Curtis Reeves Jr., also a Navy veteran and a retired Tampa police captain, left the theater to complain to management, then returned and started arguing with Chad Oulson. Witnesses said Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, who then pulled a .380 semiautomatic pistol and fired once. 
 
 On Wednesday, her face pale and drawn, Nicole Oulson spoke out for the first time about her husband's death, calling it ""unimaginable."" 
 
 ""In the blink of an eye my whole world just got shattered into a million pieces,"" Oulson, 33, tearfully told the media gathered at a news conference in her attorneys' office. ""Now I'm left trying to pick them up and trying to put them all back together. 
 
 ""It's so hard and so unbearable,"" she added before leaving the room. 
 
 Reeves, 71, is in jail in Pasco County, charged with second-degree murder. 
 
 Attorney Stephen Leal, a member of the law firm hired by Mrs. Oulson, said his client would oppose bail for Reeves, who has a court hearing set for Feb. 5. Leal said it might be tough to argue that Reeves, who spent most of his life in the area, is a flight risk. But it could be successfully argued that he poses a danger to the community. 
 
 ""I don't know how anybody could be able to convince a judge … the community is safe if this man is out,"" he said. 
 
 Attorney TJ Grimaldi said Nicole Oulson was surprised that Reeves' attorney said he acted in self-defense. 
 
 ""I think she's kind of shocked,"" he said. ""She doesn't understand what he was defending himself over."" 
 
 Grimaldi wouldn't close the door on suing the Alabama-based Cobb theater chain but would not comment further. 
 
 ""We're exploring all options, but our main focus right now is to guide her through this difficult time of grief, her own personal injury and the entire circus that is the criminal case,"" he said. ""It's sad when it's gotten to this level that we can't go to a movie theater and feel safe."" 
 
 Florida law allows two years for a wrongful death case to be filed and four years for an injury lawsuit. 
 
 Attorney Brandon Scheele, who has defended corporations in injury and death cases, said he thinks the plaintiffs would have a difficult time. The law requires them to prove that the shooting was ""foreseeable and preventable."" Reeves simply complaining to management about someone texting wouldn't be enough, he said. 
 
 ""He'd have to have said he was going to shoot the guy"" if employees didn't take action, Scheele said. 
 
 Personal injury attorney Hutch Brock said the substance of Reeves' complaint — who he talked to and what he said — would also be critical in determining whether there was negligence by the theater staff. If Reeves, who has been accused of complaining about another patron's texting about a month before the shooting, had a reputation for making threats, ""then I think the movie theater likely had some kind of a higher duty than just to let this guy keep coming back in."" 
 
 He said most personal injury lawyers allow the police to do their jobs before deciding whether to sue. 
 
 ""They try to stay out of their way,"" Brock said. 
 
 The Oulsons' daughter, Alexis, is too young to be fully aware of what has happened but she ""knows that Daddy's gone,"" Grimaldi said. 
 
 Nicole Oulson said Alexis is where her focus is now ""and always will be."" 
 
 The attorneys said a trust fund has been set up to help Oulson's family. In a grass roots movement, businesses have held fundraisers and donated proceeds. In all, more than $20,000 has accumulated. 
 
 Grimaldi said Nicole Oulson has been touched by the community's generosity. ""She didn't expect this,"" he said. ||||| Through tears today, Nicole Oulson broke her silence, describing the moment her husband, Chad Oulson, was fatally shot after texting in a Florida movie theater. 
 
 ""And just to think that in the blink of an eye, my whole world just got shattered into a million pieces,"" she said during a news conference at her attorney's office. ""And now I'm left trying to pick them all up and putting them back together."" 
 
 The Oulsons were enjoying a rare night out together Jan. 13, after leaving their young daughter, Alexis, with a babysitter. 
 
 ""Me and my husband didn't get a date night very often, much less a whole day to spend together, so I was just so excited and looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life,"" Oulson said today. 
 
 During previews before the movie ""Lone Survivor"" at a Wesley Chapel, Fla., theater, Chad Oulson sent one last text to the babysitter. That reportedly annoyed Curtis Reeves, a retired police captain, sitting with his wife behind the Oulsons. 
 
 RELATED: Woman texter's close encounter with accused movie theater gunman 
 
 According to authorities, an argument erupted between the two men. Reeves, 71, went to tell the movie theater managers and when he returned, the argument escalated, according to police. 
 
 Chad Oulson threw popcorn at Reeves and Reeves pulled out a .380 semi-automatic handgun and shot him. Nicole Oulson was wounded in the hand when she put it up to protect her husband, according to the sheriff's office. Chad Oulson, 43, died that night. 
 
 Reeves was arrested at the theater. 
 
 Reeves previously said he ""was in fear of being attacked"" by Chad Oulson so he pulled his gun from his pants pocket and shot the victim, police said. 
 
 The sheriff said Reeves' gun jammed after the first and only shot was fired. 
 
 Reeves was charged with second-degree murder. He is claiming self-defense. 
 
 ""He was struck in the face with an unknown object,"" said Reeves' lawyer Richard Escobar. ""At that point, he has every right to defend himself."" 
 
 Reeves' lawyers say they plan to invoke Florida's controversial ""Stand Your Ground"" law, added to that, under Florida law there are harsher penalties for those who attack people older than 65. 
 
 That news was heartbreaking for Nicole Oulson. 
 
 ""It's hard and it's so unbearable,"" she said. ""But I want to thank you for all of your thoughts and prayers.""

 On the Case 
 
 A French-speaking FBI agent in Seattle, who knew an Algerian accent when he heard it, was the right man to question Benni Noris. 
 
 Learn more about the 1999 WTO riots in Seattle. 
 
 Even Humphries, a wiry, high-energy, third-year man, was ready for a breather and a good night's sleep. But seconds into the phone conversation, he was fully alert. 
 
 Agent Patrick Gahan, calling from Port Angeles, Wash., across Puget Sound on the Olympic Peninsula, was calling about an arrest Humphries had heard a bit about earlier that evening. U.S. Customs officers had detained a suspicious man coming by ferry from Canada. In his trunk were bags of white powder, mysterious chemicals and homemade timing devices. 
 
 The detainee, Benni Noris, seemed to speak only French. Gahan didn't, so he was calling Humphries  who had learned French as a high-school student in Ontario, Canada  to help. 
 
 Give me a few minutes to get to the office, Humphries told Gahan. When he got downtown, Humphries obtained a copy of the standard Miranda-rights card in French. He called the customs trailer in Port Angeles and spoke to the suspect on a speaker phone. 
 
 Humphries read Noris his rights in French. Then he asked, ""Voulez-vous parler de ce qui est arrivé?"" Do you want to talk about what has occurred? 
 
 ""Non monsieur, je ne veux pas en parler."" No sir, I do not want to talk about it. 
 
 That single sentence told Humphries plenty. He asked that Gahan turn off the speaker and get on the line. 
 
 What ID does this guy have? Humphries asked. A Canadian passport and baptismal certificate from Montreal, with the name Benni Antoine Noris, came the reply. 
 
 ""There is no way this guy is who he says he is,"" Humphries said. ""There's no way he's from Montreal."" 
 
 The agent knew Quebecois French  and this wasn't it. The accent, he thought, sounded like that of a language instructor he had in the Army  a man from Algeria. 
 
 Humphries, Gahan and customs officials decided to hold the suspect on suspicion of using false identification. They needed to buy time to sort this out. 
 
 The next morning, Humphries wrote up his ""302,"" FBI parlance for the form used to detail the events of the night before. He gave it to Bob Houston, who oversees agents on the Seattle counterterrorism desk, expecting Houston to assign the case to a more experienced agent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 STEVE RINGMAN / THE SEATTLE TIMES Seattle FBI Agent Fred Humphries' first terrorism case was a big one: Ahmed Ressam. With only three years’ tenure at the bureau, he didn’t expect to be assigned a major international case. 
 
 Humphries, 34, grew up in Steilacoom, Wash., went to high school in Canada and joined the U.S. Army. He climbed steadily through the ranks, but as a captain in military intelligence he feared he was on track to be a career pencil pusher. He decided to go back to school, winning a scholarship to the University of Tampa and studying criminology. 
 
 He spent a summer during college as an intern with the Sheriff's Office in Sangamon County, Ill., where his stepfather was the chief medical examiner. He met FBI agents working on a missing-persons case, and he was hooked. 
 
 Here he was with his own major international case. It was a keen responsibility  coordinating with federal prosecutors, assigning tasks, conducting interviews and keeping track of evidence. 
 
 All this would be especially daunting because the Seattle office was in disarray. It had just been moved into new quarters. Agents hadn't been assigned desks or phones, and their files were stored in boxes. The one working phone line did not accept direct-dial, long-distance calls. Agents were running around with pockets full of quarters, searching for a pay phone that wasn't already tied up. At one point, FBI Director Louis Freeh called the Seattle office for an update but gave up trying to get through. 
 
 When Humphries finally found a phone, he contacted the bureau's Hazardous Materials Team in Quantico, Va., and asked for specialists to join him. And he began digging for details on the mysterious Benni Noris. Noris had no criminal history in Canada and had never been to the U.S., according to a review of Canadian and U.S. databases. 
 
 The next day, Humphries drove to Port Angeles with two HazMat agents and set up a post at the Port Angeles airport. There, he took a call from an FBI agent based in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. The Ottawa agent had been given a photograph by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service that might match Humphries' mysterious Mr. Noris. 
 
 The agent faxed over the photo, saying only: ""If this is your guy, you've got trouble."" No explanation; no name. 
 
 Humphries took the picture to the Clallam County Jail. The suspect looked drawn, with dark rings under his eyes. But Humphries found his resemblance to the photo unmistakable. 
 
 The man before him was not Benni Noris. But who was he?

 TAMPA — The socialite whose friendship with CIA director David Petraeus touched off a sex scandal that led to his resignation had an ID issued by MacDill Air Force Base allowing her daytime visits to the base whenever she desired. 
 
 The ID first issued to Jill Kelley in November 2010 was revoked on Tuesday pending a Pentagon investigation, MacDill officials say. 
 
 The ID is one of about 800 issued by MacDill's 6th Air Mobility Wing in a program called Friends of MacDill, which allows select civilians who pass a background check to visit MacDill without being accompanied by someone with a military ID. 
 
 The wing serves as something akin to a landlord for other commands at the base, including U.S. Central Command. Petraeus was CentCom's chief from 2008 to 2010. The wing is in charge of base security, and its armed personnel stand watch at MacDill's entry gates. 
 
 The program was launched in late 2010 by Col. Lenny Richoux, former wing commander who now serves in Europe. 
 
 Kelley obtained the ID four months after Petraeus left CentCom in June 2010 to take command of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. His deputy commander, Marine Gen. John Allen, served as CentCom's acting chief for six weeks after Petraeus' departure. 
 
 Kelley's pass was renewed in February 2012. 
 
 Allen is himself ensnared in the controversy surrounding Kelley and Petraeus. The Pentagon is investigating emails between Allen and Kelley that may have been inappropriate, according to published reports. 
 
 In a recent interview with the Tampa Bay Times, the wing's current commander, Col. Scott DeThomas, described Friends of MacDill as a successful program allowing civilians to visit MacDill's two golf courses, eat at one of several restaurants or go bowling, among other activities. 
 
 DeThomas said ID holders ""tend to be very active on base."" 
 
 Richoux told the Times last year that one of the rationales for the program, aside from forging beneficial ties to the community, is to help generate revenue for MacDill's recreational outlets. 
 
 ""Some people have told me they've lived their whole lives in Tampa and never set foot on the base,"" Richoux said last year. ""They always wondered about what happens here. So I said, 'Well, come on down and see. This is federal property. This belongs to you.' "" 
 
 The program was by invitation only, and Richoux said he had invited Tampa Bay area business and civic leaders. 
 
 Pass holders are fingerprinted and undergo a background check. Some high-security areas of MacDill are off limits and visits are limited to daylight hours. 
 
 Timm Sweeney, who runs an international marketing and research firm in Tampa, told the Times last year that the program builds goodwill for the base in Tampa. 
 
 ""MacDill has a very good vetting process,"" he said. ""It's not like they're just inviting any crazy on the base."" 
 
 Richoux said Friends of MacDill was approved by Air Force officials, and he said that he also sought the approval and advice of officials at CentCom and U.S. Special Operations Command, which also is located at MacDill. 
 
 MacDill declined to release the names of the people on the access list.

Petraeus as C.I.A. director is a “hard-charging” veteran who helped investigate the foiled millennium terrorist plot in 1999, colleagues said on Wednesday. 
 
 The agent, Frederick W. Humphries II, 47, is also described by former colleagues as relentless in his pursuit of what he sees as wrongdoing, which appears to describe his role in the F.B.I. investigation involving Mr. Petraeus. Suspecting that the case involved serious security issues and was being stalled, possibly for political reasons — a suspicion his superiors say was unjustified — he took his concerns to Congressional Republicans. 
 
 “Fred is a passionate kind of guy,” one former colleague said. “He’s kind of an obsessive type. If he locked his teeth onto something, he’d be a bulldog.” 
 
 The question of how and why the F.B.I. opened the investigation that has had such momentous consequences has been central from the moment Mr. Petraeus stepped down Friday. The emerging portrait of the agent who initiated the inquiry is another step toward an answer. 
 
 Mr. Humphries, who was identified on Wednesday by law enforcement colleagues, took the initial complaint from Jill Kelley, a Tampa woman active in local military circles and a personal friend, about anonymous e-mails that accused her of inappropriately flirtatious behavior toward Mr. Petraeus. 
 
 The subsequent cyberstalking investigation uncovered an extramarital affair between Mr. Petraeus and Paula Broadwell, his biographer, who agents determined had sent the anonymous e-mails. It also ensnared Gen. John R. Allen, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, after F.B.I. agents discovered what a law enforcement official said on Wednesday were sexually explicit e-mail exchanges between him and Ms. Kelley. 
 
 A spokesman for Ms. Kelley provided her version of events in two conference calls with reporters on Wednesday. Ms. Kelley’s concern when she took the e-mails to Mr. Humphries was that she feared the sender was “stalking” Mr. Petraeus and General Allen, said the spokesman, who asked not to be identified. 
 
 “She asks the agent, ‘What do you make of this?’ ” the spokesman said. “The agent said: ‘This is serious. They seem to know the comings and goings of a couple of generals.’ ” 
 
 General Allen himself had received a similar anonymous e-mail message, sent by someone identified as “kelleypatrol,” advising him to stay away from Ms. Kelley. The general forwarded it to Ms. Kelley, and they discussed a concern that someone was cyberstalking them. 
 
 On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said he had asked the Senate to postpone a confirmation hearing for General Allen’s next assignment while the department’s inspector general reviewed his e-mail correspondence with Ms. Kelley, which was discovered by F.B.I. agents investigating her initial complaint. 
 
 Pentagon officials said the review covered more than 10,000 pages of documents that included “inappropriate” messages. But associates of General Allen have said that the two exchanged about a dozen e-mails a week since meeting two years ago and that his messages were affectionate but platonic. 
 
 A law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, disputed that assertion on Wednesday, saying some messages were clearly sexual. Investigators were confident “the nature of the content warranted passing them on” to the inspector general, the official said. 
 
 In a statement on Wednesday, General Allen’s military counsel said he intended to cooperate fully with the inspector general’s investigation. “To the extent there are questions about certain communications by General Allen, he shares in the desire to resolve those questions as completely and quickly as possible,” said the statement from Col. John G. Baker, the chief defense counsel of the Marine Corps.","– And now the cast of characters in the David Petraeus scandal is a bit more complete: The FBI agent whose investigation into emails sent to his pal Jill Kelley eventually exposed the whole sordid mess has been identified by the New York Times as 47-year-old Frederick Humphries.

 — A judge’s act of compassion has a former Fort Bragg soldier promising to get his life back on track. 
 
 A Cumberland County judge sentenced veteran Joseph Serna to spend one night in jail for a probation violation, but the former soldier was shocked when the judge served the time with him. 
 
 Serna is a former Special Forces soldier who has been deployed four times. Since his retirement, he has used alcohol to fight battlefield demons. 
 
 “I’ve lost a lot of friends and I take my bumps as well and I didn’t want to talk about it,” said Serna. 
 
 Serna’s fight to get sober landed him in Cumberland County’s Veterans Treatment Court, which is run by District Court Judge Lou Olivera. 
 
 “It’s a treatment court, but it’s a treatment court that’s targeted to those veterans who keep on appearing in the court system for particular reasons,” Olivera said. 
 
 Serna has appeared before Olivera 25 times while going through the treatment program. Serna said last week, he didn’t tell the truth about his urinalysis test, and Olivera ordered him to spend 24-hours behind bars. 
 
 Olivera drove Serna to the jail in Robeson County. The cell door closed and Serna sat on the cot. He said the door rattled, then opened, and he was shocked at what happened next. 
 
 “The judge comes in … and so we’re sitting there and they lock the door and I realized, oh, we’re going to stay the night. He’s going to stay the night here with me,” Serna said. 
 
 The two men spent most of the night talking about their military service. 
 
 “It was more of a father-son conversation as opposed to a judge talking to someone and sentencing them. It was personal,” Serna said. 
 
 Olivera, who served in the Gulf War, said he hopes the experience helps Serna to get his life back on track. 
 
 “They have worn the uniform and we know they can be contributing members of society. We just want to get them back there,” Olivera said. 
 
 Olivera said he has never before spent the night in prison with someone he has sentenced and doesn't know if he would do it again.","– An Afghanistan vet sentenced to a night in jail for a probation violation found himself with an unusual cellmate for the night: the judge who sentenced him.

 PREFACE 
 
 Fifty years ago, the declaration “Nostra aetate ” of the Second Vatican Council was promulgated. Its fourth article presents the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people in a new theological framework. The following reflections aim at looking back with gratitude on all that has been achieved over the last decades in the Jewish-Catholic relationship, providing at the same time a new stimulus for the future. Stressing once again the unique status of this relationship within the wider ambit of interreligious dialogue, theological questions are further discussed, such as the relevance of revelation, the relationship between the Old and the New Covenant, the relationship between the universality of salvation in Jesus Christ and the affirmation that the covenant of God with Israel has never been revoked, and the Church’s mandate to evangelize in relation to Judaism. This document presents Catholic reflections on these questions, placing them in a theological context, in order that their significance may be deepened for members of both faith traditions. The text is not a magisterial document or doctrinal teaching of the Catholic Church, but is a reflection prepared by the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews on current theological questions that have developed since the Second Vatican Council. It is intended to be a starting point for further theological thought with a view to enriching and intensifying the theological dimension of Jewish-Catholic dialogue. 
 
 1. A brief history of the impact of “Nostra aetate” (No.4) over the last 50 years 
 
 “Nostra aetate” (No.4) is rightly counted among those documents of the Second Vatican Council which have been able to effect, in a particularly striking manner, a new direction of the Catholic Church since then. This shift in the relations of the Church with the Jewish people and Judaism becomes apparent only when we recall that there were previously great reservations on both sides, in part because the history of Christianity has been seen to be discriminatory against Jews, even including attempts at forced conversion (cf. “Evangelii gaudium”, 248). The background of this complex connection consists inter alia in an asymmetrical relationship: as a minority the Jews were often confronted by and dependent upon a Christian majority. The dark and terrible shadow of the Shoah over Europe during the Nazi period led the Church to reflect anew on her bond with the Jewish people. 
 
 The fundamental esteem for Judaism expressed in “Nostra aetate” (No.4) however has enabled communities that once faced one another with scepticism to become - step by step over the years - reliable partners and even good friends, capable of weathering crises together and negotiating conflicts positively. Therefore, the fourth article of “Nostra aetate” is recognised as the solid foundation for improving the relationship between Catholics and Jews. 
 
 For the practical implementation of “Nostra aetate” (No.4), Blessed Pope Paul VI on 22 October 1974 established the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews which, although organisationally attached to the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, is operationally independent and entrusted with the task of accompanying and fostering religious dialogue with Judaism. From a theological perspective it also makes good sense to link this Commission with the Council for Promoting Christian Unity, since the separation between Synagogue and Church may be viewed as the first and most far-reaching breach among the chosen people. 
 
 Within a year of its foundation, the Holy See’s Commission published its first official document on 1 December 1974, with the title “Guidelines and Suggestions for Implementing the Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate (No.4)”. The crucial and new concern of this document consists in becoming acquainted with Judaism as it defines itself, giving expression to the high esteem in which Christianity holds Judaism and stressing the great significance for the Catholic Church of dialogue with the Jews, as stated in the words of the document: “On the practical level in particular, Christians must therefore strive to acquire a better knowledge of the basic components of the religious tradition of Judaism: they must strive to learn by what essential traits the Jews define themselves in the light of their own religious experience” (Preamble). On the basis of the Church’s witness of faith in Jesus Christ, the document reflects upon the specific nature of the Church’s dialogue with Judaism. Reference is made in the text to the roots of Christian liturgy in its Jewish matrix, new possibilities are outlined for rapprochement in the spheres of teaching, education and training, and finally suggestions are made for joint social action. 
 
 Eleven years later on 24 June 1985, the Holy See’s Commission issued a second document entitled “Notes on the correct way to present the Jews and Judaism in preaching and catechesis in the Roman Catholic Church”. This document has a stronger theolo gical- exegetical orientation insofar as it reflects on the relationship of the Old and New Testaments, delineates the Jewish roots of the Christian faith, explicates the manner in which ‘the Jews’ are represented in the New Testament, points out commonalities in liturgy, above all in the great festivals of the church year, and briefly focuses on the relationship of Judaism and Christianity in history. With regard to the “land of the forefathers” the document emphasizes: “Christians are invited to understand this religious attachment which finds its roots in Biblical tradition, without however making their own any particular religious interpretation of this relationship. ... The existence of the State of Israel and its political options should be envisaged not in a perspective which is in itself religious, but in their reference to the common principles of international law.” The permanence of Israel is however to be perceived as an “historic fact and a sign to be interpreted within God’s design” (VI, 1). 
 
 A third document of the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews was presented to the public on 16 March 1998. It deals with the Shoah under the title “We remember. A reflection on the Shoah”. This text delivers the harsh but accurate judgement that the balance of the 2000-year relationship between Jews and Christians is regrettably negative. It recalls the attitude of Christians towards the anti-Semitism of the National Socialists and focuses on the duty of Christians to remember the human catastrophe of the Shoah. In a letter at the beginning of this declaration Saint Pope John Paul II expresses his hope that this document will truly “help to heal the wounds of past misunderstandings and injustices. May it enable memory to play its necessary part in the process of shaping a future in which the unspeakable iniquity of the Shoah will never again be possible.” 
 
 In the series of documents issued by the Holy See, reference must be made to the text published by the Pontifical Biblical Commission on 24 May 2001, which deals explicitly with Jewish-Catholic dialogue: “The Jewish People and their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible”. This represents the most significant exegetical and theological document of the Jewish-Catholic dialogue and is a treasure-trove of common issues which have their basis in the Scriptures of Judaism and Christianity. The Sacred Scriptures of the Jewish people are considered a “fundamental component of the Christian Bible”, the fundamental themes of the Holy Scripture of the Jewish people and their adoption into the faith in Christ are discussed, and the manner in which Jews are represented in the New Testament is illustrated in detail. 
 
 Texts and documents, as important as they are, cannot replace personal encounters and face-to-face dialogues. While under Blessed Pope Paul VI the first steps in Jewish- Catholic dialogue were undertaken, Saint Pope John Paul II succeeded in fostering and deepening this dialogue through compelling gestures towards the Jewish people. He was the first pope to visit the former concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau to pray for the victims of the Shoah, and he visited the Roman Synagogue to express his solidarity with the Jewish community. In the context of an historical pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he was also a guest of the state of Israel where he participated in interreligious encounters, paid a visit to both Chief Rabbis and prayed at the Western Wall. Again and again he met with Jewish groups, whether in the Vatican or during his numerous apostolic journeys. So too Benedict XVI, even before his election to the papacy, engaged in Jewish-Catholic dialogue by offering in a series of lectures important theological reflections on the relationship between the Old and the New Covenant, and the Synagogue and the Church. Following his election and in the footsteps of Saint Pope John Paul II he fostered this dialogue in his own way by reinforcing the same gestures and giving expression to his esteem for Judaism through the power of his words. As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was greatly committed to fostering Jewish-Catholic dialogue and had many friends among the Jews of Argentina. Now as Pope he continues, at the international level, to intensify dialogue with Judaism through many friendly encounters. One of his first such encounters was in May 2014 in Israel, where he met with the two Chief Rabbis, visited the Western Wall, and prayed for the victims of the Shoah in Yad Vashem. 
 
 Even before the establishment of the Holy See’s Commission, there were contacts and links with various Jewish organisations through the then Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity. Since Judaism is multi-facetted and not constituted as an organisational unity, the Catholic Church was faced with the challenge of determining with whom to engage, because it was not possible to conduct individual and independent bilateral dialogues with all Jewish groupings and organisations which had declared their readiness to dialogue. To resolve this problem the Jewish organisations took up the suggestion of the Catholic Church to establish a single organisation for this dialogue. The International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC) is the official Jewish representative to the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. 
 
 The IJCIC began its work in 1970, and a year later the first joint conference was organized in Paris. The conferences which have been conducted regularly since are the responsibility of the entity known as the International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee (ILC), and they shape the collaboration between the IJCIC and the Holy See’s Commission. In February 2011, once more in Paris, the ILC was able to look back with gratitude on 40 years of institutional dialogue. Much has developed over the past 40 years; the former confrontation has turned into successful cooperation, the previous potential for conflict has become positive conflict management, and the past co-existence marked by tension has been replaced by resilient and fruitful mutuality. The bonds of friendship forged in the meantime have proved to be stable, so that it has become possible to address even controversial subjects together without the danger of permanent damage being done to the dialogue. This was all the more necessary because over the past decades the dialogue had not always been free of tensions. In general, however, one can observe with appreciation that in Jewish-Catholic dialogue since the new millennium above all, intensive efforts have been made to deal openly and positively with any arising differences of opinion and conflicts, in such a way that mutual relations have become stronger. 
 
 Beside the dialogue with the IJCIC we should also mention the institutional conversation with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, which is clearly to be seen as a fruit of the encounter of Saint Pope John Paul II with both Chief Rabbis in Jerusalem during his visit to Israel in March 2000. The first meeting was organised in June 2002 in Jerusalem, and since then such meetings have been conducted annually, taking place in Rome and Jerusalem alternately. The two delegations are relatively small so that a very personal and intensive discussion on various subjects is possible, such as on the sanctity of life, the status of the family, the significance of the Sacred Scriptures for life in society, religious freedom, the ethical foundations of human behaviour, the ecological challenge, the relationship of secular and religious authority and the essential qualities of religious leadership in secular society. The fact that the Catholic representatives taking part in the meetings are bishops and priests and the Jewish representatives almost exclusively rabbis permits individual topics to be examined from a religious perspective as well. The dialogue with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel has to that extent enabled more open relations between Orthodox Judaism and the Catholic Church at a global level. After each meeting a joint declaration is published which in each instance has testified to the richness of the common spiritual heritage of Judaism and Christianity and to what valuable treasures are still to be unearthed. In reviewing over more than ten years of dialogue we can gratefully affirm that a strong friendship has resulted which represents a firm foundation for the future. 
 
 The efforts of the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews cannot of course be restricted to these two institutional dialogues. The Commission aims in fact at being open to all streams within Judaism and at maintaining contact with all Jewish groupings and organisations that wish to establish links with the Holy See. The Jewish side shows a particular interest in audiences with the Pope, which are in every instance prepared by the Commission. Besides direct contacts with Judaism the Holy See’s Commission also strives to provide opportunities within the Catholic Church for dialogue with Judaism and to work together with individual Bishops’ Conferences to support them locally in promoting Jewish-Catholic dialogue. The introduction of the ‘Day of Judaism’ in some European countries is a good example of this. 
 
 Over the past decades both the ‘dialogue ad extra’ and the ‘dialogue ad intra’ have led with increasing clarity to the awareness that Christians and Jews are irrevocably inter­dependent, and that the dialogue between the two is not a matter of choice but of duty as far as theology is concerned. Jews and Christians can enrich one another in mutual friendship. Without her Jewish roots the Church would be in danger of losing its soteriological anchoring in salvation history and would slide into an ultimately unhistorical Gnosis. Pope Francis states that “while it is true that certain Christian beliefs are unacceptable to Judaism, and that the Church cannot refrain from proclaiming Jesus as Lord and Messiah, there exists as well a rich complementarity which allows us to read the texts of the Hebrew Scriptures together and to help one another to mine the riches of God’s word. We can also share many ethical convictions and a common concern for justice and the development of peoples” (“Evangelii gaudium”, 249). 
 
 The special theological status of Jewish-Catholic dialogue 
 
 The dialogue with Judaism is for Christians something quite special, since Christianity possesses Jewish roots which determine relations between the two in a unique way (cf. “Evangelii gaudium”, 247). In spite of the historical breach and the painful conflicts arising from it, the Church remains conscious of its enduring continuity with Israel. Judaism is not to be considered simply as another religion; the Jews are instead our “elder brothers” (Saint Pope John Paul II), our “fathers in faith” (Benedict XVI). Jesus was a Jew, was at home in the Jewish tradition of his time, and was decisively shaped by this religious milieu (cf. “Ecclesia in Medio Oriente”, 20). His first disciples gathered around him had the same heritage and were defined by the same Jewish tradition in their everyday life. In his unique relationship with his heavenly Father, Jesus was intent above all on proclaiming the coming of the Kingdom of God. “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe in the gospel” (Mk 1:15). Within Judaism there were many very different kinds of ideas regarding how the kingdom of God would be realised, and yet Jesus’ central message on the Kingdom of God is in accordance with some Jewish thinking of his day. One cannot understand Jesus’ teaching or that of his disciples without situating it within the Jewish horizon in the context of the living tradition of Israel; one would understand his teachings even less so if they were seen in opposition to this tradition. In Jesus not a few Jews of his time saw the coming of a ‘new Moses’, the promised Christ (Messiah). But his coming nevertheless provoked a drama with consequences still felt today. Fully and completely human, a Jew of his time, descendant of Abraham, son of David, shaped by the whole tradition of Israel, heir of the prophets, Jesus stands in continuity with his people and its history. On the other hand he is, in the light of the Christian faith, himself God - the Son - and he transcends time, history, and every earthly reality. The community of those who believe in him confesses his divinity (cf. Phil 2:6-11). In this sense he is perceived to be in discontinuity with the history that prepared his coming. From the perspective of the Christian faith, he fulfils the mission and expectation of Israel in a perfect way. At the same time, however, he overcomes and transcends them in an eschatological manner. Herein consists the fundamental difference between Judaism and Christianity, that is, how the figure of Jesus is to be evaluated. Jews are able to see Jesus as belonging to their people, a Jewish teacher who felt himself called in a particular way to preach the Kingdom of God. That this Kingdom of God has come with himself as God’s representative is beyond the horizon of Jewish expectation. The conflict between Jesus and the Jewish authorities of his time is ultimately not a matter of an individual transgression of the law, but of Jesus’ claim to be acting with divine authority. The figure of Jesus thus is and remains for Jews the ‘stumbling block’, the central and neuralgic point in Jewish-Catholic dialogue. From a theological perspective, Christians need to refer to the Judaism of Jesus’ time and to a degree also the Judaism that developed from it over the ages for their own self-understanding. Given Jesus’ Jewish origins, coming to terms with Judaism in one way or another is indispensable for Christians. Yet, the history of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity has also been mutually influenced over time. 
 
 Dialogue between Jews and Christians then can only be termed ‘interreligious dialogue’ by analogy, that is, dialogue between two intrinsically separate and different religions. It is not the case that two fundamentally diverse religions confront one another after having developed independently of one another or without mutual influence. The soil that nurtured both Jews and Christians is the Judaism of Jesus’ time, which not only brought forth Christianity but also, after the destruction of the temple in the year 70, post-biblical rabbinical Judaism which then had to do without the sacrificial cult and, in its further development, had to depend exclusively on prayer and the interpretation of both written and oral divine revelation. Thus Jews and Christians have the same mother and can be seen, as it were, as two siblings who - as is the normal course of events for siblings - have developed in different directions. The Scriptures of ancient Israel constitute an integral part of the Scriptures of both Judaism and Christianity, understood by both as the word of God, revelation, and salvation history. The first Christians were Jews; as a matter of course they gathered as part of the community in the Synagogue, they observed the dietary laws, the Sabbath and the requirement of circumcision, while at the same time confessing Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah sent by God for the salvation of Israel and the entire human race. With Paul the ‘Jewish Jesus movement’ definitively opens up other horizons and transcends its purely Jewish origins. Gradually his concept came to prevail, that is, that a non-Jew did not have to become first a Jew in order to confess Christ. In the early years of the Church, therefore, there were the so-called Jewish Christians and the Gentile Christians, the ecclesia ex circumcisione and the ecclesia ex gentibus, one Church originating from Judaism, the other from the Gentiles, who however together constituted the one and only Church of Jesus Christ. 
 
 The separation of the Church from the Synagogue does not take place abruptly however and, according to some recent insights, may not have been complete until well into the third or fourth centuries. This means that many Jewish Christians of the first period did not perceive any contradiction between living in accordance with some aspects of the Jewish tradition and yet confessing Jesus as the Christ. Only when the number of Gentile Christians represented the majority, and within the Jewish community the polemics regarding the figure of Jesus took on sharper contours, did a definitive separation appear to be no longer avoidable. Over time the siblings Christianity and Judaism increasingly grew apart, becoming hostile and even defaming one another. For Christians, Jews were often represented as damned by God and blind since they were unable to recognise in Jesus the Messiah and bearer of salvation. For Jews, Christians were often seen as heretics who no longer followed the path originally laid down by God but who went their own way. It is not without reason that in the Acts of the Apostles Christianity is called ‘the way’ (cf. Acts 9:2; 19:9,23; 24:14,22) in contrast to the Jewish Halacha which determined the interpretation of the law for practical conduct. Over time Judaism and Christianity became increasingly alienated from one another, even becoming involved in ruthless conflicts and accusing one another of abandoning the path prescribed by God. 
 
 On the part of many of the Church Fathers the so-called replacement theory or supersessionism steadily gained favour until in the Middle Ages it represented the standard theological foundation of the relationship with Judaism: the promises and commitments of God would no longer apply to Israel because it had not recognised Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God, but had been transferred to the Church of Jesus Christ which was now the true ‘new Israel’, the new chosen people of God. Arising from the same soil, Judaism and Christianity in the centuries after their separation became involved in a theological antagonism which was only to be defused at the Second Vatican Council. With its Declaration “Nostra aetate” (No.4) the Church unequivocally professes, within a new theological framework, the Jewish roots of Christianity. While affirming salvation through an explicit or even implicit faith in Christ, the Church does not question the continued love of God for the chosen people of Israel. A replacement or supersession theology which sets against one another two separate entities, a Church of the Gentiles and the rejected Synagogue whose place it takes, is deprived of its foundations. From an originally close relationship between Judaism and Christianity a long-term state of tension had developed, which has been gradually transformed after the Second Vatican Council into a constructive dialogue relationship. 
 
 There have often been attempts to identify this replacement theory in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This Epistle, however, is not directed to the Jews but rather to the Christians of Jewish background who have become weary and uncertain. Its purpose is to strengthen their faith and to encourage them to persevere, by pointing to Christ Jesus as the true and ultimate high priest, the mediator of the new covenant. This context is necessary to understand the Epistle’s contrast between the first purely earthly covenant and a second better (cf. Heb 8:7) and new covenant (cf. 9:15, 12:24). The first covenant is defined as outdated, in decline and doomed to obsolescence (cf. 8:13), while the second covenant is defined as everlasting (cf. 13:20). To establish the foundations of this contrast the Epistle refers to the promise of a new covenant in the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:31-34 (cf. Heb 8:8-12). This demonstrates that the Epistle to the Hebrews has no intention of proving the promises of the Old Covenant to be false, but on the contrary treats them as valid. The reference to the Old Testament promises is intended to help Christians to be sure of their salvation in Christ. At issue in the Epistle to the Hebrews is not the contrast of the Old and New Covenants as we understand them today, nor a contrast between the church and Judaism. Rather, the contrast is between the eternal heavenly priesthood of Christ and the transitory earthly priesthood. The fundamental issue in the Epistle to the Hebrews in the new situation is a Christological interpretation of the New Covenant. For exactly this reason, “Nostra aetate” (No.4) did not refer to the Epistle to the Hebrews, but rather to Saint Paul’s reflections in his letter to the Romans 9-11. 
 
 For an outside observer, the Conciliar Declaration “Nostra aetate” could give the impression that the text deals with the relations of the Catholic Church with all world religions in a relationship based on parity, but the history of its development and the text itself point in a different direction. Originally Saint Pope John XXIII proposed that the Council should promulgate a Tractatus de Iudaeis, but in the end the decision was made to give consideration to all world religions in “Nostra aetate”. However, the fourth article of this Conciliar Declaration, which deals with a new theological relationship with Judaism, represents almost the heart of the document, in which a place is also made for the Catholic 
 
 Church’s relationship with other religions. The relationship with Judaism can in that sense be seen as the catalyst for the determination of the relationship with the other world religions. 
 
 Nevertheless, from the theological perspective the dialogue with Judaism has a completely different character and is on a different level in comparison with the other world religions. The faith of the Jews testified to in the Bible, found in the Old Testament, is not for Christians another religion but the foundation of their own faith, although clearly the figure of Jesus is the sole key for the Christian interpretation of the Scriptures of the Old Testament. The cornerstone of the Christian faith is Jesus (cf. Acts 4:11; 1 Pt 2:4-8). However, the dialogue with Judaism occupies a unique position for Christians; Christianity is by its roots connected with Judaism as with no other religion. Therefore the Jewish-Christian dialogue can only with reservations be termed ‘interreligious dialogue’ in the true sense of the expression; one could however speak of a kind of ‘intra-religious’ or ‘intra-familial’ dialogue sui generis. In his address in the Roman Synagogue on 13 April 1986 Saint Pope John Paul II expressed this situation in these words: “The Jewish religion is not ‘extrinsic’ to us but in a certain way is ‘intrinsic’ to our own religion. With Judaism therefore we have a relationship which we do not have with any other religion. You are our dearly beloved brothers and, in a certain way, it could be said that you are our elder brothers.” 
 
 Revelation in history as ‘Word of God’ in Judaism and Christianity 
 
 We find in the Old Testament God’s plan of salvation presented for his people (cf. “Dei verbum”, 14). This plan of salvation is expressed in an enlightening way at the beginning of biblical history in the call to Abraham (Gen 12ff). In order to reveal himself and speak to humankind, redeeming it from sin and gathering it together as one people, God began by choosing the people of Israel through Abraham and setting them apart. To them God revealed himself gradually through his emissaries, his prophets, as the true God, the only God, the living God, the redeeming God. This divine election was constitutive of the people of Israel. Only after the first great intervention of the redeeming God, the liberation from slavery in Egypt (cf. Ex 13:17ff) and the establishment of the covenant at Sinai (Ex 19ff), did the twelve tribes truly become a nation and become conscious of being the people of God, the bearers of his message and his promises, witnesses of his merciful favour in the midst of the nations and also for the nations (cf. Is 26:1-9; 54; 60; 62). In order to instruct his people on how to fulfil their mission and how to pass on the revelation entrusted to them, God gave Israel the law which defines how they are to live (cf. Ex 20; Deut 5), and which distinguishes them from other peoples. 
 
 Like the Church itself even in our own day, Israel bears the treasure of its election in fragile vessels. The relationship of Israel with its Lord is the story of its faithfulness and its unfaithfulness. In order to fulfil his work of salvation despite the smallness and weakness of the instruments he chose, God manifested his mercy and the graciousness of his gifts, as well as his faithfulness to his promises which no human infidelity can nullify (cf. Rom 3:3; 2 Tim 2:13). At every step of his people along the way God set apart at least a ‘small number’ (cf. Deut 4:27), a ‘remnant’ (cf. Is 1:9; Zeph 3:12; cf. also Is 6:13; 17:5-6), a handful of the faithful who ‘have not bowed the knee to Baal’ (cf. 1 Kings 19:18). Through this remnant, God realized his plan of salvation. Constantly the object of his election and love remained the chosen people as through them - as the ultimate goal - the whole of humanity is gathered together and led to him. 
 
 The Church is called the new people of God (cf. “Nostra aetate”, No.4) but not in the sense that the people of God of Israel has ceased to exist. The Church “was prepared in a remarkable way throughout the history of the people of Israel and by means of the Old Covenant” (“Lumen gentium”, 2). The Church does not replace the people of God of Israel, since as the community founded on Christ it represents in him the fulfilment of the promises made to Israel. This does not mean that Israel, not having achieved such a fulfilment, can no longer be considered to be the people of God. “Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures” (“Nostra aetate”, No.4). 
 
 God revealed himself in his Word, so that it may be understood by humanity in actual historical situations. This Word invites all people to respond. If their responses are in accord with the Word of God they stand in right relationship with him. For Jews this Word can be learned through the Torah and the traditions based on it. The Torah is the instruction for a successful life in right relationship with God. Whoever observes the Torah has life in its fullness (cf. Pirqe Avot II, 7). By observing the Torah the Jew receives a share in communion with God. In this regard, Pope Francis has stated: “The Christian confessions find their unity in Christ; Judaism finds its unity in the Torah. Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Word of God made flesh in the world; for Jews the Word of God is present above all in the Torah. Both faith traditions find their foundation in the One God, the God of the Covenant, who reveals himself through his Word. In seeking a right attitude towards God, Christians turn to Christ as the fount of new life, and Jews to the teaching of the Torah.” (Address to me mbers of the International Council of Christians and Jews, 30 June 2015). 
 
 Judaism and the Christian faith as seen in the New Testament are two ways by which God’s people can make the Sacred Scriptures of Israel their own. The Scriptures which Christians call the Old Testament is open therefore to both ways. A response to God’s word of salvation that accords with one or the other tradition can thus open up access to God, even if it is left up to his counsel of salvation to determine in what way he may intend to save mankind in each instance. That his will for salvation is universally directed is testified by the Scriptures (cf. eg. Gen 12:1-3; Is 2:2-5; 1 Tim 2:4). Therefore there are not two paths to salvation according to the expression “Jews hold to the Torah, Christians hold to Christ”. Christian faith proclaims that Christ’s work of salvation is universal and involves all mankind. God’s word is one single and undivided reality which takes concrete form in each respective historical context. 
 
 In this sense, Christians affirm that Jesus Christ can be considered as ‘the living Torah of God’. Torah and Christ are the Word of God, his revelation for us human beings as testimony of his boundless love. For Christians, the pre-existence of Christ as the Word and Son of the Father is a fundamental doctrine, and according to rabbinical tradition the Torah and the name of the Messiah exist already before creation (cf. Genesis Rabbah 1,1). Further, according to Jewish understanding God himself interprets the Torah in the Eschaton, while in Christian understanding everything is recapitulated in Christ in the end (cf. Eph 1:10; Col 1:20). In the gospel of Matthew Christ is seen as it were as the ‘new Moses’. Matthew 5:17-19 presents Jesus as the authoritative and authentic interpreter of the Torah (cf. Lk 24:27, 45-47). In the rabbinical literature, however, we find the identification of the Torah with Moses. Against this background, Christ as the ‘new Moses’ can be connected with the Torah. Torah and Christ are the locus of the presence of God in the world as this presence is experienced in the respective worship communities. The Hebrew dabar means word and event at the same time - and thus one may reach the conclusion that the word of the Torah may be open for the Christ event. 
 
 4. The relationship between the Old and New Testament and the Old and New Covenant 
 
 The covenant that God has offered Israel is irrevocable. “God is not man, that he should lie” (Num 23:19; cf. 2 Tim 2:13). The permanent elective fidelity of God expressed in earlier covenants is never repudiated (cf. Rom 9:4; 11:1-2). The New Covenant does not revoke the earlier covenants, but it brings them to fulfilment. Through the Christ event Christians have understood that all that had gone before was to be interpreted anew. For Christians the New Covenant has acquired a quality of its own, even though the orientation for both consists in a unique relationship with God (cf. for example, the covenant formula in Lev 26:12, “I will be your God and you will be my people”). For Christians, the New Covenant in Christ is the culminating point of the promises of salvation of the Old Covenant, and is to that extent never independent of it. The New Covenant is grounded in and based on the Old, because it is ultimately the God of Israel who concludes the Old Covenant with his people Israel and enables the New Covenant in Jesus Christ. Jesus lives during the period of the Old Covenant, but in his work of salvation in the New Covenant confirms and perfects the dimensions of the Old. The term covenant, therefore, means a relationship with God that takes effect in different ways for Jews and Christians. The New Covenant can never replace the Old but presupposes it and gives it a new dimension of meaning, by reinforcing the personal nature of God as revealed in the Old Covenant and establishing it as openness for all who respond faithfully from all the nations (cf. Zech 8:20-23; Psalm 87). 
 
 Unity and difference between Judaism and Christianity come to the fore in the first instance with the testimonies of divine revelation. With the existence of the Old Testament as an integral part of the one Christian Bible, there is a deeply rooted sense of intrinsic kinship between Judaism and Christianity. The roots of Christianity lie in the Old Testament, and Christianity constantly draws nourishment from these roots. However, Christianity is grounded in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, who is recognised as the Messiah promised to the Jewish people, and as the only begotten Son of God who has communicated himself through the Holy Spirit following his death on the cross and his resurrection. With the existence of the New Testament, the question naturally arose quite soon of how the two testaments are related to one another, whether for example the New Testament writings have not superseded the older writings and nullified them. This position was represented by Marcion, who in the second century held that the New Testament had made the Old Testament book of promises obsolete, destined to fade away in the glow of the new, just as one no longer needs the light of the moon as soon as the sun has risen. This stark antithesis between the Hebrew and the Christian Bible never became an official doctrine of the Christian Church. By excluding Marcion from the Christian community in 144, the Church rejected his concept of a purely “Christian” Bible purged of all Old Testament elements, bore witness to its faith in the one and only God who is the author of both testaments, and thus held fast to the unity of both testaments, the “concordia testamentorum”. 
 
 This is of course only one side of the relationship between the two testaments. The common patrimony of the Old Testament not only formed the fundamental basis of a spiritual kinship between Jews and Christians but also brought with it a basic tension in the relationship of the two faith communities. This is demonstrated by the fact that Christians read the Old Testament in the light of the New, in the conviction expressed by Augustine in the indelible formula: “In the Old Testament the New is concealed and in the New the Old is revealed” (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2, 73). Pope Gregory the Great also spoke in the same sense when he defined the Old Testament as “the prophecy of the New” and the latter as the “best exposition of the Old” (Homiliae in Ezechielem I, VI, 15; cf. “Dei verbum”, 16). 
 
 This Christological exegesis can easily give rise to the impression that Christians consider the New Testament not only as the fulfilment of the Old but at the same time as a replacement for it. That this impression cannot be correct is evident already from the fact that Judaism too found itself compelled to adopt a new reading of Scripture after the catastrophe of the destruction of the Second Temple in the year 70. Since the Sadducees who were bound to the temple did not survive this catastrophe, the rabbis, following in the footsteps of the Pharisees, who had already developed their particular mode of reading and interpreting Scripture, now did so without the temple as the centre of Jewish religious devotion. 
 
 As a consequence there were two responses to this situation, or more precisely, two new ways of reading Scripture, namely the Christological exegesis of the Christians and the rabbinical exegesis of that form of Judaism that developed historically. Since each mode involved a new interpretation of Scripture, the crucial new question must be precisely how these two modes are related to each other. But since the Christian Church and post-biblical rabbinical Judaism developed in parallel, but also in opposition and mutual ignorance, this question cannot be answered from the New Testament alone. After centuries of opposing positions it has been the duty of Jewish-Catholic dialogue to bring these two new ways of reading the Biblical writings into dialogue with one another in order to perceive the “rich complementarity” where it exists and “to help one another to mine the riches of God’s word” (“Evangelii gaudium”, 249). The document of the Pontifical Biblical Commission “The Jewish People and Their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible” in 2001 therefore stated that Christians can and must admit “that the Jewish reading of the Bib le is a possible one, in continuity with the Jewish Scriptures from the Second Temple period, a reading analogous to the Christian reading which developed in parallel fashion”. It then draws the conclusion: “Both readings are bound up with the vision of their respective faiths, of which the readings are the result and expression. Consequently, both are irreducible” (No.22). 
 
 Since each of the two readings serves the purpose of rightly understanding God’s will and word, it becomes evident how important is the awareness that the Christian faith is rooted in the faith of Abraham. That raises the further question of how the Old and the New Covenant stand in relation to one another. For the Christian faith it is axiomatic that there can only be one single covenant history of God with humanity. The covenant with Abraham, with circumcision as its sign (cf. Gen 17), and the covenant with Moses restricted to Israel regarding obedience to the law (cf. Ex 19:5; 24:7-8) and in particular the observance of the Sabbath (cf. Ex 31:16-17) had been extended in the covenant with Noah, with the rainbow as its sign (cf. “Verbum Domini”, 117), to the whole of creation (cf. Gen 9:9 ff). Through the prophets God in turn promises a new and eternal covenant (cf. Is 55:3; 61:8; Jer 31:31-34; Ez 36:22-28). Each of these covenants incorporates the previous covenant and interprets it in a new way. That is also true for the New Covenant which for Christians is the final eternal covenant and therefore the definitive interpretation of what was promised by the prophets of the Old Covenant, or as Paul expresses it, the “Yes” and “Amen” to “all that God has promised” (2 Cor 1:20). The Church as the renewed people of God has been elected by God without conditions. The Church is the definitive and unsurpassable locus of the salvific action of God. This however does not mean that Israel as the people of God has been repudiated or has lost its mission (cf. “Nostra aetate”, No.4). The New Covenant for Christians is therefore neither the annulment nor the replacement, but the fulfilment of the promises of the Old Covenant. 
 
 For Jewish-Christian dialogue in the first instance God’s covenant with Abraham proves to be constitutive, as he is not only the father of Israel but also the father of the faith of Christians. In this covenant community it should be evident for Christians that the covenant that God concluded with Israel has never been revoked but remains valid on the basis of God’s unfailing faithfulness to his people, and consequently the New Covenant which Christians believe in can only be understood as the affirmation and fulfilment of the Old. Christians are therefore also convinced that through the New Covenant the Abrahamic covenant has obtained that universality for all peoples which was originally intended in the call of Abram (cf. Gen 12:1-3). This recourse to the Abrahamic covenant is so essentially constitutive of the Christian faith that the Church without Israel would be in danger of losing its locus in the history of salvation. By the same token, Jews could with regard to the Abrahamic covenant arrive at the insight that Israel without the Church would be in danger of remaining too particularist and of failing to grasp the universality of its experience of God. In this fundamental sense Israel and the Church remain bound to each other according to the covenant and are interdependent. 
 
 That there can only be one history of God’s covenant with mankind, and that consequently Israel is God’s chosen and beloved people of the covenant which has never been repealed or revoked (cf. Rom 9:4; 11:29), is the conviction behind the Apostle Paul’s passionate struggle with the dual fact that while the Old Covenant from God continues to be in force, Israel has not adopted the New Covenant. In order to do justice to both facts Paul coined the expressive image of the root of Israel into which the wild branches of the Gentiles have been grafted (cf. Rom 11:16-21). One could say that Jesus Christ bears in himself the living root of the “green olive tree”, and yet in a deeper meaning that the whole promise has its root in him (cf. Jn 8:58). This image represents for Paul the decisive key to thinking of the relationship between Israel and the Church in the light of faith. With this image Paul gives expression to the duality of the unity and divergence of Israel and the Church. On the one hand the image is to be taken seriously in the sense that the grafted wild branches have not their origin as branches in the plant onto which they are grafted and their new situation represents a new reality and a new dimension of God’s work of salvation, so that the Christian Church cannot merely be understood as a branch or a fruit of Israel (cf. Mt 8:10­13). On the other hand, the image is also to be taken seriously in the sense that the Church draws nourishment and strength from the root of Israel, and that the grafted branches would wither or even die if they were cut off from the root of Israel (cf. “Ecclesia in Medio Oriente”, 21). 
 
 5. The universality of salvation in Jesus Christ and God’s unrevoked covenant with Israel 
 
 Since God has never revoked his covenant with his people Israel, there cannot be different paths or approaches to God’s salvation. The theory that there may be two different paths to salvation, the Jewish path without Christ and the path with the Christ, whom Christians believe is Jesus of Nazareth, would in fact endanger the foundations of Christian faith. Confessing the universal and therefore also exclusive mediation of salvation through Jesus Christ belongs to the core of Christian faith. So too does the confession of the one God, the God of Israel, who through his revelation in Jesus Christ has become totally manifest as the God of all peoples, insofar as in him the promise has been fulfilled that all peoples will pray to the God of Israel as the one God (cf. Is 56:1-8). The document “Notes on the correct way to present the Jews and Judaism in preaching and catechesis in the Roman Catholic Church” published by the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews in 1985 therefore maintained that the Church and Judaism cannot be represented as “two parallel ways to salvation”, but that the Church must “witness to Christ as the Redeemer for all” (No.I, 7). The Christian faith confesses that God wants to lead all people to salvation, that 
 
 Jesus Christ is the universal mediator of salvation, and that there is no “other name under heaven given to the human race by which we are to be saved” (Acts 4:12). 
 
 From the Christian confession that there can be only one path to salvation, however, it does not in any way follow that the Jews are excluded from God’s salvation because they do not believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah of Israel and the Son of God. Such a claim would find no support in the soteriological understanding of Saint Paul, who in the Letter to the Romans not only gives expression to his conviction that there can be no breach in the history of salvation, but that salvation comes from the Jews (cf. also Jn 4:22). God entrusted Israel with a unique mission, and He does not bring his mysterious plan of salvation for all peoples (cf. 1 Tim 2:4) to fulfilment without drawing into it his “first-born son” (Ex 4:22). From this it is self-evident that Paul in the Letter to the Romans definitively negates the question he himself has posed, whether God has repudiated his own people. Just as decisively he asserts: “For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable” (Rom 11:29). That the Jews are participants in God’s salvation is theologically unquestionable, but how that can be possible without confessing Christ explicitly, is and remains an unfathomable divine mystery. It is therefore no accident that Paul’s soteriological reflections in Romans 9-11 on the irrevocable redemption of Israel against the background of the Christ-mystery culminate in a magnificent doxology: “Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways” (Rom 11:33). Bernard of Clairvaux (De cons. III/1,3) says that for the Jews “a determined point in time has been fixed which cannot be anticipated”. 
 
 Another focus for Catholics must continue to be the highly complex theological question of how Christian belief in the universal salvific significance of Jesus Christ can be combined in a coherent way with the equally clear statement of faith in the never-revoked covenant of God with Israel. It is the belief of the Church that Christ is the Saviour for all. There cannot be two ways of salvation, therefore, since Christ is also the Redeemer of the Jews in addition to the Gentiles. Here we confront the mystery of God’s work, which is not a matter of missionary efforts to convert Jews, but rather the expectation that the Lord will bring about the hour when we will all be united, “when all peoples will call on God with one voice and ‘serve him shoulder to shoulder’ ” (“Nostra aetate”, No.4). 
 
 The Declaration of the Second Vatican Council on Judaism, that is the fourth article of “Nostra aetate”, is located within a decidedly theological framework regarding the universality of salvation in Jesus Christ and God’s unrevoked covenant with Israel. That does not mean that all theological questions which arise in the relationship of Christianity and Judaism were resolved in the text. These questions were introduced in the Declaration, but require further theological reflection. Of course, there had been earlier magisterial texts which focussed on Judaism, but “Nostra aetate” (No.4) provides the first theological overview of the relationship of the Catholic Church to the Jews. 
 
 Because it was such a theological breakthrough, the Conciliar text is not infrequently over-interpreted, and things are read into it which it does not in fact contain. An important example of over-interpretation would be the following: that the covenant that God made with his people Israel perdures and is never invalidated. Although this statement is true, it cannot be explicitly read into “Nostra aetate” (No.4). This statement was instead first made with full clarity by Saint Pope John Paul II when he said during a meeting with Jewish representatives in Mainz on 17 November 1980 that the Old Covenant had never bee n revoked by God: “The first dimension of this dialogue, that is, the meeting between the people of God of the Old Covenant, never revoked by God ... and that of the New Covenant, is at the same time a dialogue within our Church, that is to say, between the first and the second part of her Bible” (No.3). The same conviction is stated also in t he Catechism of the Church in 1993: “The Old Covenant has never been revoked” (121). 
 
 The Church’s mandate to evangelize in relation to Judaism 
 
 It is easy to understand that the so-called ‘mission to the Jews’ is a very delicate and sensitive matter for Jews because, in their eyes, it involves the very existence of the Jewish people. This question also proves to be awkward for Christians, because for them the universal salvific significance of Jesus Christ and consequently the universal mission of the Church are of fundamental importance. The Church is therefore obliged to view evangelisation to Jews, who believe in the one God, in a different manner from that to people of other religions and world views. In concrete terms this means that the Catholic Church neither conducts nor supports any specific institutional mission work directed towards Jews. While there is a principled rejection of an institutional Jewish mission, Christians are nonetheless called to bear witness to their faith in Jesus Christ also to Jews, although they should do so in a humble and sensitive manner, acknowledging that Jews are bearers of God’s Word, and particularly in view of the great tragedy of the Shoah. 
 
 The concept of mission must be presented correctly in dialogue between Jews and Christians. Christian mission has its origin in the sending of Jesus by the Father. He gives his disciples a share in this call in relation to God’s people of Israel (cf. Mt 10:6) and then as the risen Lord with regard to all nations (cf. Mt 28:19). Thus the people of God attains a new dimension through Jesus, who calls his Church from both Jews and Gentiles (cf. Eph 2:11­22) on the basis of faith in Christ and by means of baptism, through which there is incorporation into his Body which is the Church (“Lumen gentium”, 14). 
 
 Christian mission and witness, in personal life and in proclamation, belong together. The principle that Jesus gives his disciples when he sends them out is to suffer violence rather than to inflict violence. Christians must put their trust in God, who will carry out his universal plan of salvation in ways that only he knows, for they are witnesses to Christ, but they do not themselves have to implement the salvation of humankind. Zeal for the “house of the Lord” and confident trust in the victorious deeds of God belong together. Christian mission means that all Christians, in community with the Church, confess and proclaim the historical realisation of God’s universal will for salvation in Christ Jesus (cf. “Ad gentes”, 7). They experience his sacramental presence in the liturgy and make it tangible in their service to others, especially those in need. 
 
 It is and remains a qualitative definition of the Church of the New Covenant that it consists of Jews and Gentiles, even if the quantitative proportions of Jewish and Gentile Christians may initially give a different impression. Just as after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ there were not two unrelated covenants, so too the people of the covenant of Israel are not disconnected from ‘the people of God drawn from the Gentiles’. Rather, the enduring role of the covenant people of Israel in God’s plan of salvation is to relate dynamically to the ‘people of God of Jews and Gentiles, united in Christ’, he whom the Church confesses as the universal mediator of creation and salvation. In the context of God’s universal will of salvation, all people who have not yet received the gospel are aligned with the people of God of the New Covenant. “In the first place there is the people to whom the covenants and promises were given and from whom Christ was born according to the flesh (cf. Rom 9:4-5). On account of their fathers this people remains most dear to God, for he does not repent of the gifts he makes nor of the calls he issues (cf. Rom 11:28-29)” (“Lumen gentium”, 16). 
 
 The goals of dialogue with Judaism 
 
 The first goal of the dialogue is to add depth to the reciprocal knowledge of Jews and Christians. One can only learn to love what one has gradually come to know, and one can only know truly and profoundly what one loves. This profound knowledge is accompanied by a mutual enrichment whereby the dialogue partners become the recipients of gifts. The Conciliar declaration “Nostra aetate” (No. 4) speaks of the rich spiritual patrimony that should be further discovered step by step through biblical and theological studies and through dialogue. To that extent, from the Christian perspective, an important goal is the mining of the spiritual treasures concealed in Judaism for Christians. In this regard one must mention above all the interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures. In the foreword by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger to the 2001 document of the Pontifical Biblical Commission “The Jewish People and their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible”, the respect of Christians for the Jewish interpretation of the Old Testament is stressed. It highlights that “Christians can learn a great deal from a Jewish exegesis practised for more than 2000 years; in return Christians may hope that Jews can profit from Christian exegetical research.” In the field of exegesis many Jewish and Christian scholars now work together and find their collaboration mutually fruitful precisely because they belong to different religious traditions. 
 
 This reciprocal acquiring of knowledge must not be limited to specialists alone. Therefore it is important that Catholic educational institutions, particularly in the training of priests, integrate into their curricula both “Nostra aetate” and the subsequent documents of the Holy See regarding the implementation of the Conciliar declaration. The Church is also grateful for the analogous efforts within the Jewish community. The fundamental changes in relations between Christians and Jews which were initiated by “Nostra aetate” (No. 4) must also be made known to the coming generations and be received and disseminated by them. 
 
 One important goal of Jewish-Christian dialogue certainly consists in joint engagement throughout the world for justice, peace, conservation of creation, and reconciliation. In the past, it may have been that the different religions - against the background of a narrowly understood claim to truth and a corresponding intolerance - contributed to the incitement of conflict and confrontation. But today religions should not be part of the problem, but part of the solution. Only when religions engage in a successful dialogue with one another, and in that way contribute towards world peace, can this be realised also on the social and political levels. Religious freedom guaranteed by civil authority is the prerequisite for such dialogue and peace. In this regard, the litmus-test is how religious minorities are treated, and which rights of theirs are guaranteed. In Jewish-Christian dialogue the situation of Christian communities in the state of Israel is of great relevance, since there - as nowhere else in the world - a Christian minority faces a Jewish majority. Peace in the Holy Land - lacking and constantly prayed for - plays a major role in dialogue between Jews and Christians. 
 
 Another important goal of Jewish-Catholic dialogue consists in jointly combatting all manifestations of racial discrimination against Jews and all forms of anti-Semitism, which have certainly not yet been eradicated and re-emerge in different ways in various contexts. History teaches us where even the slightest perceptible forms of anti-Semitism can lead: the human tragedy of the Shoah in which two-thirds of European Jewry were annihilated. Both faith traditions are called to maintain together an unceasing vigilance and sensitivity in the social sphere as well. Because of the strong bond of friendship between Jews and Catholics, the Catholic Church feels particularly obliged to do all that is possible with our Jewish friends to repel anti-Semitic tendencies. Pope Francis has repeatedly stressed that a Christian can never be an anti-Semite, especially because of the Jewish roots of Christianity. 
 
 Justice and peace, however, should not simply be abstractions within dialogue, but should also be evidenced in tangible ways. The social-charitable sphere provides a rich field of activity, since both Jewish and Christian ethics include the imperative to support the poor, disadvantaged and sick. Thus, for example, the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews and the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC) worked together in 2004 in Argentina during the financial crisis in that country to organise joint soup kitchens for the poor and homeless, and to enable impoverished children to attend school by providing meals for them. Most Christian churches have large charitable organisations, which likewise exist within Judaism. These would be able to work together to alleviate human need. Judaism teaches that the commandment “to walk in His ways” (Deut 11:22) requires the imitation of the Divine Attributes (Imitatio Dei) through care for the vulnerable, the poor and the suffering (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 14a). This principle accords with Jesus’ instruction to support those in need (cf. eg. Mt 25:35-46). Jews and Christians cannot simply accept poverty and human suffering; rather they must strive to overcome these problems. 
 
 When Jews and Christians make a joint contribution through concrete humanitarian aid for justice and peace in the world, they bear witness to the loving care of God. No longer in confrontational opposition but cooperating side by side, Jews and Christians should seek to strive for a better world. Saint Pope John Paul II called for such cooperation in his address to the Central Council of German Jewry and to the Conference of Rabbis in Mainz on 17 November 1980: “Jews and Christians, as children of Abraham, are called to be a blessing for the world ... , by committing themselves together for peace and justice among all men and peoples, with the fullness and depth that God himself intended us to have, and with the readiness for sacrifices that this goal may demand”.

 [English, French] ||||| Catholics Should Not Try To Convert Jews, Vatican Commission Says

 Furthering a thaw in relations that began 50 years ago, the Vatican has released a new document about Catholics' historic ties with Jews, whom Pope Benedict once called the church's ""fathers in faith."" Among the panel's conclusions: Jews don't need to be converted to find salvation. 
 
 ""While affirming salvation through an explicit or even implicit faith in Christ,"" the Vatican document reads, ""the Church does not question the continued love of God for the chosen people of Israel."" 
 
 Titled ""The Gifts and Calling of God are irrevocable,"" the 10,000-word document calls for Jews and Christians to work together to make the world a better place by combating poverty and human suffering. 
 
 NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports: 
 
 ""The new document states that owing to the Jewish roots of Christianity, Catholic dialogue with Judaism cannot in any way be compared with dialogue with other world religions. It says Jesus can only be understood in the Jewish context of his time. ""The document was drafted by the Vatican Commission for Religious Relations With Jews; the commission was created following the release half a century ago of the groundbreaking document called Nostra Aetate — 'In Our Times.' ""That document repudiated the idea of collective Jewish guilt for Jesus' death. ""The new document says that from a detached coexistence, Catholics and Jews have arrived at a deep friendship. And it says Catholics must refrain from active attempts to convert Jews."" 
 
 The Vatican commission includes the work of Cardinal Kurt Koch and the Rev. Norbert Hofmann. They presented the results of their work Thursday alongside Edward Kessler, founder of the Woolf Institute in Cambridge, U.K., and Rabbi David Rosen, the American Jewish Committee's International Director of Interreligious Affairs. 
 
 While it seeks to deal with hundreds of years of history, the Vatican document also quotes the current pope: 
 
 ""Pope Francis states that 'while it is true that certain Christian beliefs are unacceptable to Judaism, and that the Church cannot refrain from proclaiming Jesus as Lord and Messiah, there exists as well a rich complementarity which allows us to read the texts of the Hebrew Scriptures together and to help one another to mine the riches of God's word. We can also share many ethical convictions and a common concern for justice and the development of peoples' ('Evangelii gaudium,' 249)."" 
 
 Discussing the document today, Rosen said, ""the very fact that we can talk about complementarity is itself a powerful demonstration of how far we have come along this remarkable journey of transformation and reconciliation between Catholics and Jews over the last half century."" 
 
 The commission's document also cites Francis' immediate predecessors: ||||| VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Catholics should not try to convert Jews and should work with them to fight anti-Semitism, the Vatican said on Thursday in a major document drawing the Church further away from the strained relations of the past.

 It was the latest move on a host of issues, such as gay rights and re-marriage, that the Vatican or Pope Francis have made showing a desire to be more compassionate and open and to move further away from entrenched traditions. 
 
 In the past, for example, Catholic prayers have denounced Jews for not believing in Jesus. Jews have also accused the World War Two papacy of turning a blind eye to the Holocaust, a charge the Vatican denies. 
 
 The new document from the Vatican’s Commission for Religious Relations with Jews stressed recent Vatican teachings that the two religions were intertwined and that God had never annulled his covenant with the Jewish people. 
 
 “The Church is therefore obliged to view evangelization (spreading Christianity) to Jews, who believe in the one God, in a different manner from that to people of other religions and world views,” it said. 
 
 It also said Catholics should be particularly sensitive about the significance to Jews of the Shoah, the Hebrew word for the Holocaust, and pledged “to do all that is possible with our Jewish friends to repel anti-Semitic tendencies”. 
 
 “A Christian can never be an anti-Semite, especially because of the Jewish roots of Christianity,” it said. 
 
 The document coincided with the 50th anniversary of a Vatican repudiation of the concept of collective Jewish guilt for Jesus’ death and the launch of a theological dialogue that traditionalists have rejected. 
 
 They believe there should be a so-called “Jewish mission” to convert Jews because they did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. Such traditionalists were therefore bound to be displeased by the document’s words on conversion, a senior Vatican official said. 
 
 “In concrete terms this means that the Catholic Church neither conducts nor supports any specific institutional mission work directed towards Jews,” said the document, adding that there was a “principled rejection of an institutional Jewish mission”. 
 
 “This is the first formal document that makes it clear there is no intentional desire to actively proselytize amongst Jews,” Rabbi David Rosen, international director of inter-religious affairs for the American Jewish Committee, told Reuters. 
 
 Rosen, who is based in Jerusalem, has been a key figure in formal theological dialogue with the Vatican for decades. 
 
 CATHOLIC PRAYER ONCE CALLED JEWS “PERFIDIOUS” 
 
 Edward Kessler, director of the Woolf Institute for the study of inter-religious relations in Cambridge, said much education of the young had to be done to dispel the notion that Christianity had “replaced and substituted” Judaism. 
 
 Kessler, who is Jewish, told a Vatican news conference that both sides had to “ensure the transformation in relations is not limited to the elite, but extends from the citadels of the Vatican to the pews of the Church as well as from the offices of the chief rabbis to the floors of our synagogues.” 
 
 Until about 1960, prayers at Catholic Masses on Good Friday, the day commemorating the death of Jesus, labeled Jews “perfidious” and called for their conversion.

 That prayer was eliminated from general use after the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council introduced a new missal, or prayer book used at Masses. 
 
 But later a prayer for the Jews was allowed to remain in the old-style Latin Mass, sometimes called the Tridentine Rite, used by ultra-traditionalists such as the Society of Saint Pius X, whose members reject the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. 
 
 In 2008, then-Pope Benedict further reformulated the prayer used by the traditionalists to remove language that Jewish groups found offensive, such as “the blindness of that people”.","– The Vatican is taking steps toward fixing its long-troubled history with the Jewish faith with the Thursday release of a 10,000-word document that instructs Catholics to help Jews fight anti-Semitism instead of trying to convert them, Reuters reports. The Commission for Religious Relations With the Jews explained that Catholicism and Judaism shared the same origins and that ""the Church is therefore obliged to view evangelization ... to Jews … in a different manner from that to people of other religions and world views."" The document continues that ""while affirming salvation through an explicit or even implicit faith in Christ, the Church does not question the continued love of God for the chosen people of Israel,"" NPR notes. The report also broaches the Holocaust, noting Catholics should be more sensitive to perceptions that the Vatican looked the other way, as well as help combat anti-Semitism. ""A Christian can never be an anti-Semite, especially because of the Jewish roots of Christianity,"" it reads. The new mandate falls in line with Pope Francis' other progressive policies, including steps on homosexuality and divorce. The Jewish director of Cambridge's Woolf Institute, which conducts interfaith research, emphasized that Catholic youth shouldn't be taught Christianity had ""replaced and substituted"" Judaism, Reuters notes. Both sides need to ""ensure the transformation in relations is not limited to the elite, but extends from the citadels of the Vatican to the pews of the Church, as well as from the offices of the chief rabbis to the floors of our synagogues,"" he adds.

 Close ||||| Allison Ng, one of the major characters in Cameron Crowe's recently released Aloha, is Asian-American. Emma Stone, the actress the director chose to portray her, is not. The casting decision raised eyebrows and drew criticism from groups who said that by using Stone to play a character who explicitly states her racially mixed background throughout the movie, Crowe was whitewashing the role. Now Crowe, in a post on his own site, has offered a ""heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice."" 
 
 The director says that he was ""grateful for the dialogue"" the backlash provided, but also took the time to defend his decision to cast Stone as Ng. ""As far back as 2007,"" Crowe writes, ""Captain Allison Ng was written to be a super-proud one-quarter Hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one."" Crowe, who has described Aloha as a film about Hawaii, says that her half-Chinese father was meant to symbolize ""the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent"" on the islands. 
 
 The director says Ng was based on a real-life, red-haired Hawaiian local 
 
 Crowe says that Ng was written to be ""extremely proud of her unlikely heritage,"" and also ""personally compelled to over-explain every chance she gets."" The character, he says, was based on a ""real-life, red-headed local"" who also detailed her background to others whenever possible. Certainly, the movie makes a point of conflating Ng's stated heritage with her outward appearances — Bradley Cooper's character makes direct reference to her self-definition as Hawaiian, in the same way Americans will define themselves as one-eighth Irish, Italian, or similar. 
 
 But despite his protestations, the director does not discount the complaints about the casting choice entirely. ""I have learned something very inspiring,"" Crowe writes. ""So many of us are hungry for stories with more racial diversity, more truth in representation, and I am anxious to help tell those stories in the future."" Hopefully, after the turgid Aloha, the director's apparently new-found cultural sensitivity will also remind him how to make good movies again.","– Examples of bad judgment abound in some of the public apologies making headlines this week: Out of bounds: ""It was a mistake to use an old joke about Joe Biden during his time of grief, and I sincerely apologize.""—Ted Cruz, after publicly mocking the VP just days after his son died. Dangerous soda? ""Ms. Ahmad was our customer and we apologize to her for what occurred on the flight.""—United Airlines, after a flight attendant refused to give a Muslim passenger a can of Diet Coke for fear it would be used ""as a weapon."" (She says her non-Muslim seatmate got a can of beer without any trouble.) Casting call: “Thank you so much for all the impassioned comments regarding the casting of the wonderful Emma Stone in the part of Allison Ng. I have heard your words and your disappointment, and I offer you a heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice.""—Cameron Crowe, for casting Stone to play an Asian-American character in Aloha. That's harassment? ""And while we have apologized to the student directly, we also want to publicly apologize for her behavior, which is not representative of KSU’s student-centered culture.” —Kennesaw State University, after one of its advisers was captured in a viral video accusing a student of harassment and calling campus police, all because he was waiting around for an adviser to become available. The adviser has to undergo training. Oh, George: ""To Heidi, I personally apologize. You are a sweetheart. ... She was generous and gracious and I am so mad at myself for retelling this story in any way that would diminish her.""—Jason Alexander, after the Seinfeld alum said the cast didn't like the character of Susan, played by Heidi Swedberg, and that's the reason she was killed off.","<pad> – Cameron Crowe has apologized to all who criticized his choice to cast Emma Stone as a character who is Asian-American, the New York Times reports.

 The 9-year-old boy who was wounded Monday is awake and expected to survive, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Tuesday at a news conference at police headquarters in downtown San Bernardino. 
 
 “All things considered, he’s in relatively good spirits,” Burguan said. 
 
 Added San Bernardino City Unified Superintendent Dale Marsden, “He’s up and watching cartoons.” 
 
 Monday morning, Cedric Anderson, 53, of Riverside, went to the elementary school where his wife, Karen Elaine Smith, 53, a 10-year veteran of the school district, was working. Saying he was just there to drop something off, he went to her classroom where Smith was, along with two classroom aides and 15 special needs students. 
 
 Anderson took just a few steps into Classroom B1, and, without saying a word, pulled out a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum revolver and fired 10 shots, reloading midway through, authorities said. Smith was killed immediately. Two boys, Jonathan Martinez, 8, and a 9-year-old fellow student, who has not been identified, were struck near her. 
 
 Jonathan Martinez 
 
 Jonathan was born with Williams syndrome, a genetic condition that affects about 1 in 10,000 people worldwide, including an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States. The syndrome causes cardiovascular disease, developmental delays and learning delays, according to the Williams Syndrome Association. 
 
 “Children with Williams syndrome tend to be social, friendly and endearing,” Marsden said. 
 
 A GoFundMe account is raising money to pay for the funeral and other expenses for Jonathan’s family. 
 
 By Tuesday evening, it had raised more than $65,000. 
 
 “We honestly can’t thank everyone enough,” Jonathan’s cousin, Brianna Lopez, wrote. “We appreciate everyone’s sweet words, and we are very speechless. Thank you (for) coming together. We will keep everyone updated on any further news. My family truly truly appreciates everything from the bottom of our hearts.” 
 
 Kate Cichy, who handles regional communications for GoFundMe, said a verification team is working with Lopez to ensure that the funds go to Jonathan’s parents. 
 
 Cedric Anderson 
 
 After shooting Smith and the two boys, Anderson killed himself. 
 
 Anderson had been arrested twice in Torrance, police records show. 
 
 He and Smith married on Jan. 28, but had separated. Neither of the cases in Torrance involved Smith. 
 
 By mid-March, Smith had moved out of their Riverside home amidst allegations of infidelity and was living with family, including her adult children. (All of her children have been checked on and are fine, according to police.) 
 
 “It appears that he had been attempting to contact her and get her to move back home,” Burguan said. 
 
 According to Smith family members interviewed by police, Anderson had made threats — although not that he intended to shoot her — but she didn’t view them as serious and just thought he was looking for attention. Smith apparently did not tell anyone but her closest family members about his odd behavior and the problems she and Anderson were experiencing. 
 
 “She effectively kept her private life private,” Burguan said. 
 
 During their search of the Riverside home on Monday, investigators found a note from Anderson about needing closure and feeling disrespected. But nothing about it suggested it was necessarily a suicide note. 
 
 “If found outside of the context of this case, I’m not sure anyone would be terribly alarmed,” Burguan said. 
 
 Neighbors at the Mount Wasatch Drive house said they saw police detain a man whom Burguan identified Tuesday as Anderson’s brother. He was interviewed but not arrested, Burguan said. 
 
 A computer and phone taken from the residence will be examined, authorities said. 
 
 Unlike the phone of Dec. 2, 2015, shooter Syed Rizwan Farook, which was hacked only when the FBI hired a company to override the encryption, police do not expect to have difficulty obtaining information from Anderson’s and Smith’s phones, Burguan said. 
 
 Police are now looking at a personal computer and cellphones obtained during their investigation. 
 
 Surveillance video at North Park shows Anderson attempted to get in through locked external doors before going through the main office, as school security requires. There, since staff knew him, they sent him to Classroom B1 and Smith. 
 
 “There was no indication to anyone (on) staff that he was a threat,” Marsden said. “The staff knew this newlywed couple but had no information about the crisis they were in.” 
 
 Anderson was arrested four times between 1982 and 2013, according to Burguan, including for nongun weapons charges, domestic violence and theft, but never convicted. It is not yet known if the domestic violence charge involved Smith. An unemployed maintenance worker, Anderson was reportedly trying to start his own business. 
 
 The Smith & Wesson revolver Anderson used Monday was purchased in Michigan in 1979 by someone other than him. It’s not yet clear how Anderson got the gun, Burguan said. 
 
 Not uncommon for spouses to visit 
 
 Marsden said all district policies were complied with when Anderson was let onto campus. 
 
 “It’s not uncommon for spouses to visit. There does not appear to be a breakdown of security,” Burguan said. “There will be a full and complete review, but it appears that things worked as they were supposed to, beyond this being a regrettable tragedy.” 
 
 North Park Elementary will be closed until Monday. All other district schools will remain open. 
 
 The district will do a complete review of its school visitation policies and procedures, according to a news release sent Tuesday afternoon. 
 
 Domestic violence 
 
 Twitter posts using the hashtag #KarenSmith began to pop up accompanied by messages about domestic violence. 
 
 “A woman is shot and killed by her partner every 16 hours. Domestic abusers should not have access to firearms. #KarenSmith,” read a post from user Erin Aura. 
 
 Another man, identifying himself as Renee Graham, pointed out that if Anderson had killed Smith in their home instead of a classroom, the attack wouldn’t be national news. He then urged people to “(s)top ignoring domestic violence.” 
 
 Because of the attack, Assemblywoman Eloise Gómez Reyes and Option House Inc. will hold a news conference today at Option House in San Bernardino to discuss domestic violence and the importance of speaking out when it occurs. 
 
 “It’s imperative that we do everything possible to call out domestic violence when it happens and to be there for the victims and connect them with services so they can begin the healing process,” said Reyes, a member of the Assembly Select Committee on Domestic Violence. 
 
 The gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety released a study Tuesday showing that between 2009 and 2016 in the U.S. there were 156 mass shootings, resulting in 848 fatalities. The group defines a mass shooting as an event in which at least four people, not including the shooter, are killed by a gun. 
 
 Of those shootings, 54 percent involved domestic or family violence, according to Everytown.

A more detailed explanation follows. However, sometimes we want to share quick information about WS to people we meet and video might not be feasible. Below is a quick explanation of Williams syndrome which is often just enough to share with friends in the community. You are encouraged to download and share electronically or print (it is business card size and can be easily carried for reference and/or distribution.)

 Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition that is present at birth and can affect anyone. It is characterized by medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning challenges. These often occur side by side with striking verbal abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity for music. 
 
 Williams syndrome is caused by the spontaneous deletion of 26-28 genes on chromosome #7. The deletion occurs in either the egg or the sperm used to form the child with Williams syndrome. Accordingly, the deletion is present at the time of conception. It is likely that the elastin gene deletion accounts for many of the physical features of Williams syndrome. Some medical and developmental problems are probably caused by deletions of additional genetic material near the elastin gene on chromosome #7. The extent of these deletions may vary among individuals. In most families, the child with Williams syndrome is the only one to have the condition in his or her entire extended family. However, the individual with Williams syndrome has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of his or her children. 
 
 WS affects 1 in 10,000 people worldwide – an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States. It is known to occur equally in both males and females and in every culture. 
 
 Children with Williams syndrome tend to be social, friendly and endearing. Parents often say the joy and perspective a child with WS brings into their lives had been unimaginable. 
 
 But there are major struggles as well. Many babies have life-threatening cardiovascular problems. Children with WS need costly and ongoing medical care and early interventions (such as speech or occupational therapy) that may not be covered by insurance or state funding. As they grow, they struggle with things like spatial relations, numbers, and abstract reasoning, which can make daily tasks a challenge. As adults, most people with Williams syndrome will need supportive housing to live to their fullest potential. Many adults with WS contribute to their communities as volunteers or paid employees; often working at assisted living homes for senior citizens, hospitals and libraries, or as store greeters or veterinary aides. 
 
 Just as important are opportunities for social interaction. As people with Williams syndrome mature – beyond the structure of school and family activities – they often experience intense isolation which can lead to depression. They are extremely sociable and experience the normal need to connect with others; however people with Williams syndrome often don’t process nuanced social cues and this makes it difficult to form lasting relationships. 
 
 There are many physical features and medical challenges which are fairly common to Williams syndrome. However, every child is an individual - the number of features present, and which features are present varies from child to child. 
 
 Common features of Williams syndrome include: 
 
 Characteristic facial appearance 
 
 Most young children with Williams syndrome are described as having similar facial features. These features include a small upturned nose, long philtrum (upper lip length), wide mouth, full lips, small chin, and puffiness around the eyes. Blue and green-eyed children with Williams syndrome can have a prominent ""starburst"" or white lacy pattern on their iris. Facial features become more apparent with age. 
 
 Heart and blood vessel problems 
 
 The majority of individuals with Williams syndrome have some type of heart or blood vessel problem. Typically, there is narrowing in the aorta producing supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), or narrowing in the pulmonary arteries. There is a broad range in the degree of narrowing, ranging from trivial to severe (requiring surgical correction of the defect). Since there is an increased risk for development of blood vessel narrowing or high blood pressure over time, periodic monitoring of cardiac status is necessary. 
 
 Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) 
 
 Some young children with Williams syndrome have elevations in their blood calcium level. The true frequency and cause of this problem is unknown. When hypercalcemia is present, it can cause extreme irritability or ""colic-like"" symptoms. Occasionally, dietary or medical treatment is needed. In most cases, the problem resolves on its own during childhood, but lifelong abnormality in calcium or Vitamin D metabolism may exist and should be monitored. 
 
 Low birth-weight / slow weight gain 
 
 Most children with Williams syndrome have a slightly lower birth-weight than their brothers or sisters. Slow weight gain, especially during the first several years of life, is also a common problem and many children are diagnosed as ""failure to thrive"". Adult stature is smaller than average 
 
 Feeding difficulty (generally limited to the early years) 
 
 Many infants and young children have feeding problems. These problems have been linked to low muscle tone, severe gag reflex, poor suck/swallow, tactile defensiveness etc. Feeding difficulties tend to resolve as the children get older. 
 
 Irritability (colic during infancy) 
 
 Many infants with Williams syndrome have an extended period of colic or irritability. This typically lasts from 4 to 10 months of age, then resolves. Abnormal sleep patterns with delayed acquisition of sleeping through the night may be associated with the colic. Extreme irritability may also be caused by hypercalcemia in some children with WS. 
 
 Dental abnormalities 
 
 Slightly small, widely spaced teeth are common in children with Williams syndrome. They also may have a variety of abnormalities of occlusion (bite), tooth shape or appearance. Most of these dental changes are readily amenable to orthodontic correction. 
 
 Kidney abnormalities 
 
 There is a slightly increased frequency of problems with kidney structure and/or function. 
 
 Hernias 
 
 Inguinal (groin) and umbilical hernias are more common in Williams syndrome than in the general population. 
 
 Hyperacusis (sensitive hearing) 
 
 Children with Williams syndrome often have more sensitive hearing than other children; certain frequencies or noise levels can be painful and/or startling to the individual. This condition often improves with age. 
 
 Musculoskeletal problems 
 
 Young children with Williams syndrome often have low muscle tone and joint laxity. As the children get older, joint stiffness (contractures) may develop. Physical therapy is very helpful in improving muscle tone, strength and joint range of motion. 
 
 Overly friendly (excessively social) personality 
 
 Individuals with Williams syndrome have a very endearing personality. They have a unique strength in their expressive language skills, and are extremely polite. They are typically unafraid of strangers and show a greater interest in contact with adults than with their peers. 
 
 Developmental delay, learning challenges and attention deficit disorder 
 
 Most people with Williams syndrome will have mild to severe learning differences and cognitive challenges. Young children with Williams syndrome often experience developmental delays. Milestones such as walking, talking and toilet training are often achieved somewhat later than is considered normal. Distractibility is a common problem in mid-childhood, which can improve as the children get older. 
 
 Older children and adults with Williams syndrome often demonstrate intellectual ""strengths and weaknesses."" There are some intellectual areas (such as speech, long term memory, and social skills) in which performance is quite strong, while other intellectual areas (such as fine motor and spatial relations) show significant weakness.","– Cedric Anderson had threatened his estranged wife before, but nobody realized how dangerous he really was until he opened fire in her San Bernardino classroom on Monday, police say. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Tuesday that Anderson, 53, who killed Karen Smith and an 8-year-old special-needs student before shooting himself, was allowed to go to Smith's classroom at North Park Elementary School because staff members recognized him, the San Bernardino Sun reports. Burguan says Smith, who separated from Anderson in March after less than three months of marriage, only told close family members that he had threatened her. ""She effectively kept her private life private,"" the chief says. The chief adds that Smith, who had moved back in with her adult children, believed Anderson's threats were only a cry for attention.

 In a personal note, NBC News Special Correspondent Tom Brokaw revealed he has been diagnosed with cancer and said he and his physicians are very encouraged with the progress he is making. 
 
 Brokaw, who has worked at NBC News since 1966, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer affecting blood cells in the bone marrow, in August at the Mayo Clinic. His doctors are optimistic about the outcome of the treatment he is receiving, and Brokaw said he remains “the luckiest guy I know.” 
 
 Throughout the treatment, Brokaw has continued to work on NBC News projects, including a two-hour documentary on the assassination of JFK; appearances on “TODAY,” “Nightly News with Brian Williams,” “Meet the Press” and MSNBC. He is also contributing to NBC Sports coverage of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. 
 
 Here is his full personal statement released on Tuesday: 
 
 “With the exceptional support of my family, medical team and friends, I am very optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing my life, my work and adventures still to come.” 
 
 “I remain the luckiest guy I know.” 
 
 “I am very grateful for the interest in my condition but I also hope everyone understands I wish to keep this a private matter.” ||||| Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer? 
 
 Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. Normal plasma cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. 
 
 The immune system is made up of several types of cells that work together to fight infections and other diseases. Lymphocytes (lymph cells) are the main cell type of the immune system. The major types of lymphocytes are T cells and B cells. 
 
 When B cells respond to an infection, they mature and change into plasma cells. Plasma cells make the antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) that help the body attack and kill germs. Lymphocytes are in many areas of the body, such as lymph nodes, the bone marrow, the intestines, and the bloodstream. Plasma cells, however, are mainly found in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside some hollow bones. In addition to plasma cells, normal bone marrow has cells that make the different normal blood cells. 
 
 When plasma cells become cancerous and grow out of control, they can produce a tumor called a plasmacytoma. These tumors generally develop in a bone, but they are also rarely found in other tissues. If someone has only a single plasma cell tumor, the disease is called an isolated (or solitary) plasmacytoma. If someone has more than one plasmacytoma, they have multiple myeloma. 
 
 Multiple myeloma is characterized by several features, including: 
 
 Low blood counts 
 
 In multiple myeloma, the overgrowth of plasma cells in the bone marrow can crowd out normal blood-forming cells, leading to low blood counts. This can cause anemia – a shortage of red blood cells. People with anemia become pale, weak, and fatigued. Multiple myeloma can also cause the level of platelets in the blood to become low (called thrombocytopenia). This can lead to increased bleeding and bruising. Another condition that can develop is leukopenia – a shortage of normal white blood cells. This can lead to problems fighting infections. 
 
 Bone and calcium problems 
 
 Myeloma cells also interfere with cells that help keep the bones strong. Bones are constantly being remade to keep them strong. Two major kinds of bone cells normally work together to keep bones healthy and strong. The cells that lay down new bone are called osteoblasts. The cells that break down old bone are called osteoclasts. Myeloma cells make a substance that tells the osteoclasts to speed up dissolving the bone. Since the osteoblasts do not get a signal to put down new bone, old bone is broken down without new bone to replace it. This makes the bones weak and they break easily. Fractured bones are a major problem in people with myeloma. This increase in bone break-down can also raise calcium levels in the blood. (Problems caused by high calcium levels are discussed in the section “How is multiple myeloma diagnosed?”) 
 
 Infections 
 
 Abnormal plasma cells do not protect the body from infections. As mentioned before, normal plasma cells produce antibodies that attack germs. For example, if you developed pneumonia, normal plasma cells would produce antibodies aimed at the specific bacteria that were causing the illness. These antibodies help the body attack and kill the bacteria. In multiple myeloma, the myeloma cells crowd out the normal plasma cells, so that antibodies to fight the infection can’t be made. The antibody made by the myeloma cells does not help fight infections. That’s because the myeloma cells are just many copies of the same plasma cell – all making copies of the same exact (or monoclonal) antibody. 
 
 Kidney problems 
 
 The antibody made by myeloma cells can harm the kidneys. This can lead to kidney damage and even kidney failure. 
 
 Monoclonal gammopathy 
 
 Having many copies of the same antibody is known as a monoclonal gammopathy. This condition can be found with a blood test. Although people with multiple myeloma have a monoclonal gammopathy, not everyone with monoclonal gammopathy has multiple myeloma. It can also occur in other diseases, such as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and some lymphomas. It can also occur in a disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which does not cause problems like multiple myeloma does. However, some people with MGUS will eventually go on to develop multiple myeloma or other diseases. 
 
 Light chain amyloidosis 
 
 Antibodies are made up of protein chains joined together – 2 short light chains and 2 longer heavy chains. In light chain amyloidosis, abnormal plasma cells make too many light chains. These light chains can deposit in tissues, where they build up. This accumulation of light chains can lead to an abnormal protein in tissues known as amyloid. The buildup of amyloid in certain organs can lead them to enlarge and not work well. For example, when amyloid builds up in the heart, it can cause an irregular heart beat and cause the heart to enlarge and get weaker. A weak heart can lead to a condition called congestive heart failure, with symptoms like shortness of breath and swelling in the legs. Amyloid in the kidneys can cause them to work poorly. This may not cause symptoms early on, but the poor kidney function may be found on blood tests. If it gets worse, amyloid in the kidney can lead to kidney failure. See the section “Signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma” for more information about the signs and symptoms of light chain amyloidosis. 
 
 Other names for light chain amyloidosis include AL and primary amyloidosis. This is sometimes considered a separate disease from multiple myeloma, but because treatment is often similar to that of myeloma, we will discuss it in this document. 
 
 Light chain amyloidosis is only one of the diseases where amyloid builds ups and causes problems. Amyloidosis can also be caused by a genetic (hereditary) disease called familial amyloidosis. Long-standing (chronic) infection and/or inflammation can also cause amyloidosis. This is known as secondary or AA amyloidosis. This document does not talk about these other kinds of amyloidosis. 
 
 Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance 
 
 In monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), abnormal plasma cells produce many copies of the same antibody (a monoclonal antibody protein). However, these plasma cells do not form an actual tumor or mass and do not cause any of the other problems seen in multiple myeloma. MGUS usually does not affect a person’s health. In particular, it doesn’t cause weak bones, high calcium levels, kidney problems, or low blood counts. It’s most often found when a routine blood test finds a high level of protein in the blood and further testing shows the protein is a monoclonal antibody. In MGUS, the number of plasma cells may be increased, but they still make up less than 10% of the cells in the bone marrow. 
 
 Some people with MGUS will eventually develop multiple myeloma, lymphoma, or amyloidosis. Each year, about 1% of people with MGUS develops one of these diseases. The risk is higher in people whose protein levels are particularly high. Patients with MGUS don’t need treatment, but they are watched closely to see if they get a disease that does need to be treated, such as multiple myeloma. 
 
 Recently, scientists have studied the genes of the plasma cells in patients with MGUS. They found that the genetic make-up of these plasma cells resembles myeloma plasma cells more than it resembles that of normal plasma cells. This suggests that these cells are truly malignant, not just slow growing. Because people with MGUS are generally elderly, they may not live long enough for it to transform into myeloma. 
 
 Solitary plasmacytomas 
 
 This is another type of abnormal plasma cell growth. Rather than many tumors in different locations as in multiple myeloma, there is only one tumor, hence the name solitary plasmacytoma. 
 
 Most often, a solitary plasmacytoma develops in a bone, where it may be called an isolated plasmacytoma of bone. When a plasmacytoma starts in other tissues (such as the lungs or other organs), it is called an extramedullary plasmacytoma. Solitary plasmacytomas are most often treated with radiation therapy. Sometimes surgery may be used for a single extramedullary plasmacytoma. As long as no other plasmacytomas are found later on, the patient’s outlook is usually excellent. However, since many people with a solitary plasmacytoma will develop multiple myeloma, these people are watched closely for signs of this disease. ||||| (CNN) -- Former NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw is being treated for cancer, but doctors are very encouraged by the progress he is making, NBC said Tuesday.

 âIâve used some of those questionable methods myself over the years,â said Mr Leigh in an article written for Media Guardian after News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman pleaded guilty to phone hacking. 
 
 âI, too, once listened to the mobile phone messages of a corrupt arms company executive â the crime similar to that for which Goodman now faces the prospect of jail,â said Mr Leigh. 
 
 He said he accessed the message when the businessman left his Pin code on a print-out. 
 
 âThere is certainly a voyeuristic thrill in hearing another personâs private messages,â he added.

 Mr Leigh also used a number of blags â pretending to be someone else â to get stories. He said: âAs for actually breaking the law? Well, it is hard to keep on the right side of legality on all occasions.â 
 
 The Guardian has been at the forefront of exposing the phone hacking at the News of the World which led to the newspaperâs closure last month. 
 
 Editor Alan Rusbridger has called for transparency in newspapers and has heavily criticised News International executives for claiming they had no knowledge of phone hacking. A Guardian spokeswoman said yesterday: âThe Guardian does not and has not authorised phone hacking.â

(Associated Press) 
 
 Several alleged victims of tabloid phone hacking in Britain will soon file lawsuits against a second newspaper group, Piers Morgan's former employer Trinity Mirror PLC, their lawyer said Friday. 
 
 Mark Lewis said the claims would be filed in ""a few weeks,"" but would not disclose identities of his clients or say precisely when the papers would be lodged at court. 
 
 Lewis represents the family of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl abducted and murdered by a pedophile in 2002. The revelation a month ago that her voicemail messages had been accessed by the News of the World while she was still missing outraged British opinion, and triggered a crisis for Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
 
 The phone hacking scandal centers on allegations that journalists eavesdropped on private phone messages, bribed police for information and hacked email accounts. 
 
 So far the crisis has centered on Murdoch's media empire, leading him to shut down the News of the World tabloid and abandon a bid to take over British Sky Broadcasting. Several former executives of the newspaper have been arrested by police investigating the eavesdropping. 
 
 But there have also been allegations of hacking by other newspapers. This week Paul McCartney's ex-wife, Heather Mills, claimed in a BBC interview that she was hacked by a Trinity Mirror journalist in 2001. 
 
 McCartney said Thursday that he planned to contact police over the claim. 
 
 ""I will be talking to them about that,"" McCartney told the U.S. television journalists by videolink from Cincinnati, Ohio. 
 
 The BBC did not identify the journalist cited by Mills, but said it was not Piers Morgan, who was editor of the group's flagship tabloid, the Daily Mirror. between 1995 and 2004. 
 
 Morgan has repeatedly denied ordering anyone to spy on voicemails or knowingly publishing stories obtained through hacking. 
 
 But in an article published by the Daily Mail in 2006, Morgan said that he had been played a tape of a message McCartney had left on Mills' cell phone in the wake of one of their fights. 
 
 ""It was heartbreaking,"" Morgan wrote. ""He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang 'We Can Work It Out' into the answerphone."" 
 
 Questions over how Morgan came to hear the message have led several British lawmakers to call on him to return to the U.K. and explain himself. 
 
 Lawmaker John Whittingdale, chairman of a parliamentary committee that is investigating hacking by the News of the World, said Thursday that Morgan ""absolutely should"" come to Britain to answer questions. 
 
 Whittingdale said ""there is evidence to suggest that other newspapers were involved in phone hacking"" _ and that police should investigate. 
 
 Both Trinity Mirror and the publisher of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, keen to stop the scandal spreading to them, have announced reviews of editorial procedures in the wake of the revelations about the scale of wrongdoing at the News of the World.

For all the trouble he has been mixed up in over his long career, Stone has never been at any real risk of serving time behind bars. Friday’s indictment might change his bearing a bit. It’s one thing to rail publicly against the possibility of a theoretical future indictment, but another to see seven federal criminal charges, carrying a total maximum sentence of 50 years, in black and white. As a practical matter, Stone isn’t looking at anything close to 50 years, but he easily could be facing five years or so if convicted on all counts. For a 66 year-old man like Stone, that could mean most or all of the rest of his life, which has to be at least a bit sobering. And the evidence laid out in the indictment seems locked in; over and over again, the indictment quotes Stone’s lies and then cites hard proof – typically Stone’s own texts – to prove that he lied. A good prosecutor could make a compelling case that cooperation offers Stone his best and most realistic chance to get through the case without having to serve time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Second, as much as we don’t like to acknowledge it in our quest for pure justice, money matters. It is expensive to defend yourself in federal court, and it is jaw-droppingly costly to go to trial. Stone has flashed vulnerability on this, declaring that he faces legal fees of $2 million – not an outrageous estimate, if a trial is involved – while noting that he is “not a wealthy man” and begging for crowdfunded donations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Third, Stone is nothing if not ego-driven. We all are, of course, but Stone’s in his own league. A prosecutor might therefore make a pitch to Stone along these lines. You can stay quiet, you can be a “stand-up” guy, you can fight the government and maybe even go to trial. Trump will send nice tweets about you, you’ll have a heavy media following for a couple years, but ultimately you’ll be a strange footnote in history. Or you can flip and be John Dean.","– In a sort of odd pot-meets-kettle situation, a Guardian investigations editor who was on the team that helped blow the lid on the News of the World scandal himself admitted to hacking ... in 2006.

30,"Remains of major new prehistoric stone monument at Durrington Walls discovered The remains of a major new prehistoric stone monument have been discovered less than 3 kilometres from Stonehenge. Using cutting edge, multi-sensor technologies the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project has revealed evidence for a large stone monument hidden beneath the bank of the later Durrington Walls 'super-henge'. 
 
 Read more on this latest discovery... 
 
 The ""Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project"" 
 
 Stonehenge occupies one of the richest archaeological landscapes in the world, recorded in the course of intensive archaeological and antiquarian research over several hundred years, yet much of this landscape effectively remains terra incognita. This project aims to address gaps in our knowledge and to advance the understanding of the Stonehenge landscape by conducting a cutting-edge geophysical and remote sensing survey at unprecedented scale. 
 
 The results of the proposed work will be used to create a highly detailed archaeological map of the 'invisible' landscape, providing the basis for a full interpretative synthesis of all existing remote sensing and geophysical data from the study area, For the first it will thus be possible to create total digital models of the Stonehenge landscape at a true 'landscape scale' that will not only transcend the immediate surrounds of individual monuments within the study area, but will also tie them together within a seamless map of sub-surface and surface archaeological features and structures. 
 
 The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, led by the University of Birmingham in conjunction with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, is the largest project of its kind. 
 
 The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project is a collaboration between the University of Birmingham, the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, Vienna and its international partners, the University of Bradford, the University of St Andrews, and the 'ORBit' Research Group of the Department of Soil Management at the University of Ghent, Belgium. 
 
 The project operates under the auspices of the National Trust and English Heritage. ||||| We walked the Avenue, the ancient route along which the stones were first dragged from the River Avon. For centuries, this was the formal path to the great henge, but now the only hint of its existence was an indentation or two in the tall grass. It was a fine English summer’s day, with thin, fast clouds above, and as we passed through fields dotted with buttercups and daisies, cows and sheep, we could have been hikers anywhere, were it not for the ghostly monument in the near distance. 
 
 Faint as the Avenue was, Vince Gaffney hustled along as if it were illuminated by runway lights. A short, sprightly archaeologist of 56, from Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England, he knows this landscape as well as anyone alive: has walked it, breathed it, studied it for uncounted hours. He has not lost his sense of wonder. Stopping to fix the monument in his eyeline, and reaching out toward the stones on the horizon, he said, “Look, it becomes cathedralesque.” 
 
 Gaffney’s latest research effort, the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, is a four-year collaboration between a British team and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology in Austria that has produced the first detailed underground survey of the area surrounding Stonehenge, totaling more than four square miles. The results are astonishing. The researchers have found buried evidence of more than 15 previously unknown or poorly understood late Neolithic monuments: henges, barrows, segmented ditches, pits. To Gaffney, these findings suggest a scale of activity around Stonehenge far beyond what was previously suspected. “There was sort of this idea that Stonehenge sat in the middle and around it was effectively an area where people were probably excluded,” Gaffney told me, “a ring of the dead around a special area—to which few people might ever have been admitted....Perhaps there were priests, big men, whatever they were, inside Stonehenge having processions up the Avenue, doing...something extremely mysterious. Of course that sort of analysis depends on not knowing what’s actually in the area around Stonehenge itself. It was terra incognita, really.” 
 
 Nobody has yet put a spade in the ground to verify the new findings, which were painstakingly gathered by geophysicists and others wielding magnetometers and ground-penetrating radars that scan the ground to detect structures and objects several yards below the surface. But Gaffney has no doubt of the work’s value. “This is among the most important landscapes, and probably the most studied landscape, in the world,” he says. “And the area has been absolutely transformed by this survey. Won’t be the same again.”

 The joys and frustrations of all archaeological study—perhaps all historical inquiry—come into particularly sharp relief at Stonehenge. Even to the most casual observer, the monument is deeply significant. Those vast stones, standing in concentric rings in the middle of a basin on Salisbury Plain, carefully placed by who-knows-who thousands of years ago, must mean something. But nobody can tell us what. Not exactly. The clues that remain will always prove insufficient to our curiosity. Each archaeological advance yields more questions, and more theories to be tested. Our ignorance shrinks by fractions. What we know is always dwarfed by what we can never know. 
 
 Take the big question: Was Stonehenge predominantly a temple, a parliament or a graveyard? Was it a healing ground? We don’t know, for sure. We know that people were buried there, and that the stones are aligned in astronomically important ways. We also understand, because of the chemical composition of animal bones found nearby and the provenance of the stones, that people traveled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge. But we cannot say, with certainty, why. 
 
 Try a simpler question: How did the bluestones, which weigh between four and eight tons apiece, arrive at the site, nearly 5,000 years ago, from 170 miles away in West Wales? Land or sea? Both alternatives explode with possibilities, and nobody has an impregnable theory. Mike Parker Pearson of University College London is working on a new idea that the bluestones might have been lifted onto huge wooden lattices and carried by dozens of men to the site. But it’s just a theory. We can’t know, definitively. We can only have better-informed questions. 
 
 The ineffability of Stonehenge has not dulled our appetite. The site has long proved irresistible to diggers. In 1620, the Duke of Buckingham had his men excavate right in the center of the monument. Although they did not know it at the time, they dug on the site of a prehistoric pit. Buckingham’s men found skulls of cattle “and other beasts” and large quantities of “burnt coals or charcoals”—but no treasure, as they had hoped. 
 
 In the 19th century, “barrow-digging,” or the excavation of prehistoric monuments and burial hills, was a popular pastime among the landed gentry. In 1839, a naval officer named Captain Beamish dug out an estimated 400 cubic feet of soil from the northeast of the Altar Stone at Stonehenge. As Parker Pearson notes in his book Stonehenge, Beamish’s “big hole was probably the final blow for any prehistoric features...that once lay at Stonehenge’s center.” 
 
 Work at Stonehenge became less invasive. In 1952, Willard Libby—the American chemist and later a Nobel Prize winner—used his new radiocarbon dating technique on a piece of charcoal from a pit within Stonehenge to date the monument to 1848 B.C., give or take 275 years. That date has since been refined several times. The prevailing opinion is that the first stones were erected on the site around 2600 B.C. (although the building of Stonehenge was carried out over a millennium, and there were centuries of ritual activity at the site before the stones were in place). 
 
 In 2003, Parker Pearson conducted his own survey, concentrating on the nearby settlement at Durrington Walls and the area between there and the River Avon. Based on huts, tools and animal bones he uncovered, he concluded that Durrington Walls likely housed the workers who built Stonehenge. Based on an analysis of human remains he later excavated from Stonehenge, he also surmised that, far from being a site of quotidian religious activity, Stonehenge served as a cemetery–a “place for the dead.” 
 
 The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project is different from everything that came before it. When Gaffney and his team started their work, they were less interested in theories than in data. To that end, they concentrated on taking what amounts to a three-dimensional and yards-deep photograph of the entire landscape. “The perceived wisdom was driven by the monuments we knew about,” says Gaffney. “We’ve put in the data between the monuments.”

 Chris Gaffney, Vince’s younger, slighter and less voluble brother, was one of the instigators of this new approach. The duo’s grandfather was a metalwork teacher from Newcastle with an interest in archaeology, who took his clever grandchildren on trips to Hadrian’s Wall, the old barrier between the Roman Empire and the blasted north. Small wonder that Vince became an archaeologist and Chris a geophysicist, now at the University of Bradford. 
 
 The Gaffney brothers’ interest in new technologies that were becoming available to archaeologists led them to the first GPS-guided magnetometer systems. A magnetometer has sensors that allow a geophysicist to see evidence of historic building, and even ancient ditch-digging, beneath the soil by mapping variations in the earth’s magnetic field. The GPS-guided versions were able to pinpoint some of those discoveries to within one centimeter. The Gaffneys believed that Stonehenge scholarship needed a massive magnetometer- and radar-led survey of the whole site. “We just didn’t know if anything’s there,” Vince Gaffney recalled. “So we’re constructing various hypotheses on the basis of something we don’t know.” 
 
 Around the same time, an Austrian archaeologist named Wolfgang Neubauer, now of the Boltzmann Institute, was hoping to conduct large-scale projects all over Europe using tools including GPS magnetometers and ground-penetrating radar. Neubauer’s team had also developed software to process the 40 or 50 gigabytes of raw data that these instruments could create in a day. Suddenly, instead of waiting weeks or months to see what the machines had found, it was possible to cover several acres with magnetometers and radar in a day and to display that information on a screen almost instantaneously. 
 
 One of the areas Neubauer wanted to scan was Stonehenge, and in the spring of 2009 he contacted Vince Gaffney. A few months later, the Boltzmann Institute and the University of Birmingham—plus several other British and European universities, museums and companies that contributed expertise and resources—began their collaboration at Stonehenge. 
 
 Their first days on site, Gaffney recalled, were “like a geophysical circus has come to town.” Tractors pushed the ground-penetrating radars, which looked like high-powered lawn mowers. All-terrain vehicles dragged the magnetometer sensors on long strings. Delicate instruments covering hard, uneven ground kept mechanics and technicians busy. “I have seen one of our magnetometers shear clear apart in front of me,” said Gaffney. “It was back in service the next day.” In all, the fieldwork took about 120 days, spread over four years. 
 
 *** 
 
 In a multimedia room at the University of Birmingham there was a vast touch screen, six feet by nine, on which a new map of the Stonehenge landscape appeared. Gaffney pointed out the key features. 
 
 There was Stonehenge itself, marked by the familiar circles. To the north was the long, thin strip called the Stonehenge Cursus or the Greater Cursus, which was demarcated by ditches, and ran east to west for nearly two miles. (The Cursus was given its name by the antiquarian William Stukeley in the 18th century because it looked like an ancient Roman race course. Its construction predates the first building work at Stonehenge by several hundred years.) Gaffney also pointed out the Cursus Barrows—hillocks containing mass human graves—just south of the Cursus itself, and King Barrow Ridge to the east. 
 
 Scattered all over the map were blotches of black: features without names. These were new finds, including the more than 15 possible new or poorly understood Neolithic monuments. Gaffney emphasized possible, acknowledging that it will require digging—“the testimony of the spade”—to discover precisely what was there. 
 
 Standing in front of this constellation of evidence, he seemed unable to decide where to start, like a child at the Christmas tree. “These are little henge monuments,” he said, touching the screen to highlight a group of black smudges. “Nice little entrance there, and a ditch. These things we know nothing about.” 
 
 He saved his greatest enthusiasm for the discoveries that had been made in the Cursus. This feature, said Gaffney, had always been thought of as a “bloody great barrier to the north of Stonehenge.” Nobody knew quite what it was for. Because the Cursus runs east to west, archaeologists have always believed that its presence owes something to the passage of the sun. The monument must be significant: It was dug in the fourth millennium B.C. using antler picks—hundreds of thousands of man-hours went into its construction. 
 
 The Hidden Landscapes Project’s instruments discovered several new clues. First of all, they found gaps in the ditch, in particular a very large break in the northern side, to allow people to enter and exit the Cursus. Now, instead of seeing the Cursus exclusively as a monument that encouraged movement along the path of the sun, east to west, Gaffney began to consider these gaps as “channels through the landscape” to guide the movement of people north to south. 
 
 A bigger discovery, Gaffney says, was a “bloody huge” pit about five yards in diameter at the eastern end of the Cursus. Today it lies buried at least three feet below the surface of the ground. Such a pit was much too large for a practical use—for instance, burying trash—because of the labor involved in digging it. In the archaeologists’ minds it could only have ritual implications, as “a marker of some kind,” Gaffney said. What’s more, if you drew a straight line between the pit and the heelstone at Stonehenge, it ran directly along the final section of the Avenue, on the path of the sunrise on the summer solstice. 
 
 “We thought, That’s a bit of a coincidence!” Gaffney recalled. “That was the point at which we thought, What’s at the other end? And there’s another pit! Two pits, marking the midsummer sunrise and the midsummer solstice, set within a monument that’s meant to be something to do with the passage of the sun.” 
 
 With his hands passing over the map, Gaffney showed how—on the longest days of the year—the pits formed a triangle with Stonehenge marking sunrise and sunset. 
 
 “Nobody had ever seen these pits before,” he continued. “But they link the area of Stonehenge with the Cursus directly. Either these things have been put inside the Cursus to mark these points, or the Cursus has been wrapped around them.” 
 
 What was so interesting about the Cursus pits was that they told a story about the landscape. The “sunrise” pit was visible from Stonehenge, but the “sunset” pit was not—it was nestled behind a ridge, and could have been seen only if there had been fire and smoke coming from it. (At some point the pits will have to be excavated for evidence of such activity.) These discoveries fed into a larger understanding of Stonehenge as “diachronic”—operating in light and dark, sunrise and sunset, day and night. 
 
 “The point I think we’re coming to,” said Gaffney, “is that increasingly we can see the area around Stonehenge as providing extensive evidence for complex liturgical movement—which we can now understand, largely because we know where things are.” 
 
 Parker Pearson, for his part, takes a cautious view of the new research. “Until you dig holes, you just don’t know what you’ve got,” he told me in his office at University College London. “What date it is, how significant it is. [There are] extraordinary new features coming up, and we’re thinking well, what are they?” 
 
 To be sure, he said the data from the Hidden Landscapes Project “backs up the pattern we’ve already been seeing for some years. We have an excessive number of solstice-aligned monuments in that landscape. Nowhere in the rest of Europe comes even close.” He added, “This is fantastic stuff that’s been done, and it’s raised a whole series of new questions,” he said. “It’s going to take years.”

 The clouds shifted in front of the sun, dappling the landscape with shadow. Gaffney and I were walking the Avenue, 300 yards or so from Stonehenge, and in the distance a string of barrows gleamed like opals. Although he acknowledged the fallibility of all archaeological projection (“In the end,” he said, “we are all wrong”), his work has led him to a new interpretation of how Stonehenge was used. 
 
 Gaffney’s idea was not to focus on Stonehenge itself, but on “processionality” within the whole landscape. He imagined people moving around the area like Roman Catholics processing through the Stations of the Cross. He recalled an Easter Friday ritual he saw in Croatia, in which a “bloke with a cross” led fellow barefoot celebrants on a miles-long trip. In Gaffney’s view, the building of the great stone circle was a “monumentalizing” of a similar, if heathen, procession. 
 
 As we walked downhill through the fields, Gaffney stopped from time to time to point out the hillocks in which “the illustrious dead” were buried. He also noted how the Avenue was not a straight line between the Avon and Stonehenge, but rather a series of tacks that brought the visitor to the Stonehenge site in a “theatrical” way, along the line of sunrise on the summer solstice. 
 
 He thrust himself into the mind of a Bronze Age visitor to the site. “You will have seen nothing like it,” he said. “It would have been massively impressive.” Soon we descended into a valley called Stonehenge Bottom, only a hundred yards or so from the great stones. “They’re disappearing....Watch, just watch!” he said. 
 
 Within a few yards, the monument became invisible. When you picture Stonehenge in your mind’s eye, you imagine the concentric rings of vast stones standing in a desolate open landscape, visible for miles around. But now, here we were, a hundred yards away, and the thing had gone. 
 
 We stood in a field, watched by some lethargic cows, and savored the strangeness of the moment. Then, as we stepped uphill, Stonehenge re-emerged on the horizon. It happened fast. The lintels, then the great sarsens, then the smaller bluestones were suddenly before us. 
 
 Gaffney’s voice lifted. He spoke about Jerusalem Syndrome: the feeling of intense emotion experienced by pilgrims on their first sighting of the Holy City. In the prehistoric world, there was no conception of God as he was understood by the later Abrahamic faiths. But, said Gaffney, as Stonehenge reappeared before us, “whatever the ancient version of Jerusalem Syndrome is, that’s what you’re feeling now.” ||||| The mysteries of Stonehenge are revealed sometimes by unusual methods—forgetting to water its grass or whacking its stones with quartz.

 The Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project has spent the past four years sweeping the area around Stonehenge with ground-penetrating radar and GPS-guided magnetometers. Without ever picking up a shovel, archeologists have mapped the ground up to two miles deep in extraordinary detail. It's staring at the ground—but with high-tech tools.

 Among the hundreds of features that were mapped are 17 newly discovered Neolithic monuments, all dating to the same period as Stonehenge about 5,000 years ago. These pits and ditches, marked by post holes, often seem to be astronomically important. 
 
 There is the Cursus, for instance, a rectangular space which is under two miles long and 300 feet wide. Two pits inside the Cursus appears to be aligned with the rising and setting sun on the summer solstice when seen from the Stonehenge's heel stone. Taken together, the monuments suggest Stonehenge is the most obvious remainder of a large complex of structures with ritual importance. 
 
 The survey also revealed surprising facts about known structures, like the Durrington Walls, a dirt bank that encircles a circumference of a mile. Underneath one section of the dirt, archeologists found more than 50 huge stones, each 10 feet long, forming a ""super henge."" ""That's a big prehistoric monument which we never knew anything about,"" the co-director of the investigation, Professor Vince Gaffney, told Nature. The structure, which faces the River Avon, could have a ritual connection with the water.

 Every summer solstice, tens of thousands of people throng to Stonehenge, creating a festival-like atmosphere at the 4,400-year-old stone monument. For the 2015 solstice, they will have a bit more room to spread out. A just-completed four-year project to map the vicinity of Stonehenge reveals a sprawling complex that includes 17 newly discovered monuments and signs of a 1.5-kilometre-around ‘super henge’. 
 
 The digital map — made from high-resolution radar and magnetic and laser scans that accumulated several terabytes of data — shatters the picture of Stonehenge as a desolate and exclusive site that was visited by few, says Vincent Gaffney, an archaeologist at the University of Birmingham, UK, who co-led the effort. 
 
 Take the cursus, a 3-kilometre-long, 100-metre-wide ditch north of Stonehenge that was thought to act as barrier. The team’s mapping uncovered gaps in the cursus leading to Stonehenge, as well as several large pits, one of which would have been perfectly aligned with the setting solstice Sun. New magnetic and radar surveys of the Durrington Walls (which had been excavated before) uncovered more than 60 now-buried holes in which stones would have sat, and a few stones still buried. 
 
 “They look as they may have been pushed over. That’s a big prehistoric monument which we never knew anything about,” says Gaffney, who calls the structure a ‘super henge.’ His team will discuss the work at the British Science Festival this week, and they plan to present it to the institutions that manage the site. “I’m sure it will guide future excavations,” Gaffney says.","– Some observers believe Stonehenge was once a full circle of enormous stones—and now there seems to be proof there are even more Neolithic monuments underneath it.

Mexican forensic experts recovered 28 charred bodies from a clandestine grave on the outskirts of this city where police engaged... (Associated Press) 
 
 IGUALA, Mexico (AP) — A clandestine grave on the outskirts of a Mexican city where police clashed with student protesters a week ago contained 28 bodies but the remains are too damaged for immediate identification, state officials said. 
 
 Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco said he could not say whether any of the dead could be some of the 43 college students reported missing after the violent confrontation in Iguala, located about 120 miles (200 kilometers) south of Mexico City. 
 
 He said genetic testing of the remains could take two weeks to two months. 
 
 Blanco said one of the people detained in the case had told investigators that 17 students were taken to the grave site on the outskirts of the Iguala and killed there. But he stressed that investigators had not confirmed the person's story. 
 
 ""As long as the identity of the cadavers has not been resolved we will continue the search"" for the missing students, he said Sunday. 
 
 State police and prosecutors have been investigating the Iguala city police for misconduct during a series of violent incidents last weekend that resulted in six shooting deaths and more than two dozen people injured. Investigators said video showed police taking away an undetermined number of student protesters. 
 
 Authorities have presented charges against 29 people in the case, including 22 police officers detained soon after the violence. Three of the suspects are fugitives, including Iguala's police chief. 
 
 Blanco said they are still investigating the motive for the crime, adding that some of the police have connections to a local drug cartel. 
 
 Blanco said Saturday that some of those arrested provided key clues that led investigators to the six unmarked burial pits on an isolated hillside about a mile (2 kilometers) from the nearest road. The bodies had been put in the pits on top of branches and tree trunks, which were doused with a flammable substance such as gasoline and set on fire. 
 
 Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer helping families of the missing students, said relatives of 37 of the young people already had provided DNA samples that will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students. 
 
 As investigators worked at the grave site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice. ""You took them alive, we want them returned alive,"" read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco. 
 
 The mother of one of the missing youths said her son, 17-year-old Luis Angel Abarca Carrillo, had enrolled in the Aytozinapa teachers college attended by the missing students in order to get ahead in life and not be a poor farmer like his brothers. 
 
 ""But now look what they did to him, he hasn't reappeared,"" said 60-year-old Margarita Carrillo. 
 
 Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible ""serious human rights abuses,"" such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police. 
 
 The commission said in a statement Sunday that it had warned about the ""delicate"" situation in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory. 
 
 Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the Aytozinapa teachers college protested outside the governor's residence in Chilpancingo. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state officials told them they would not be allowed to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates. 
 
 Like many other schools in Mexico's ""rural teachers college"" system, Aytozinapa is known for militant and radical protests.

 Investigators in Mexico are working to identify 28 bodies retrieved from a grave near the southern town of Iguala. 
 
 The grave is located in an area where 43 protesting students went missing after clashing with police last month. 
 
 Inaky Blanco, the chief prosecutor of Guerrero state, said identification could take two weeks. 
 
 The students disappeared after taking part in a protest over teachers' rights. Police opened fire on their buses, killing six people. 
 
 Witnesses said that most of the survivors - all trainee teachers - were bundled into police vans. 
 
 Some had gone into hiding and contacted their relatives after several days, still fearing for their lives. 
 
 Twenty-two police officers are being held in connection with the 27 September shooting. 
 
 Mr Blanco said one of those detained had admitted that 17 students had been shot dead at the site where the bodies were found. But he stressed that investigators had not confirmed the suspect's story.

 Iguala lies about 120 miles (200km) south of the capital Mexico City. The grave was discovered on Saturday, following an anonymous tip, local media reported. 
 
 State prosecutors said local officials and police officers could have links with criminal gangs operating in Guerrero state. 
 
 Arrest warrants have been issued for the mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Albarca, and his security chief who are both considered fugitives from justice and may be involved in the violence. 
 
 Mexico correspondent Will Grant says the incident has highlighted the extent of the collusion between criminal groups and officials in much of the country.","– Investigators are still trying to identify 28 ""savagely slaughtered"" bodies found in mass graves outside the Mexican city of Iguala—but they fear they have found evidence of an atrocity carried out by local police with ties to organized crime. Six students were killed when a group of students clashed with police in the city in Guerrero state late last month, and DNA tests will be carried out on the badly burned bodies that have been recovered to discover whether they are among the 43 students, mostly men in their early 20s, who went missing after the incident, reports the Los Angeles Times. The state's chief prosecutor says it could take up to two weeks to identify the bodies found in the graves, which were found after an anonymous tip. Some 22 local police officers are among more than 30 people who have been arrested over the incident, and the city's mayor and police chief are now fugitives, the BBC reports. The teachers' college the students attended is known for militant protests, and the discovery of the graves sparked a huge protest in the state capital from parents and around 2,000 supporters, who put a huge banner saying, ""You took them alive, we want them returned alive"" over the highway linking Mexico City and Acapulco, reports the AP.","<pad> A clandestine grave on the outskirts of a Mexican city where police clashed with student protesters a week ago contained 28 bodies but the remains are too damaged for immediate identification, state officials said. Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco said he could not say whether any of the dead could be some of the 43 college students reported missing after the violent confrontation in Iguala, located about 120 miles south of Mexico City. He said genetic testing of the remains could take two weeks to two months. Blanco said one of the people detained",0.2844036652112617,0.08219177658402162,0.18348623401860126

 Angelika Graswald, charged with second-degree murder in her fiance's disappearance, told authorities that she tampered with Vincent Viafore's kayak and that as she watched him drown, ""it felt good knowing he was going to die,"" according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office. 
 
 A bail hearing was held Wednesday afternoon in the Orange County Court for Graswald, a 35-year-old Poughkeepsie resident, who has been indicted by a grand jury on second-degree murder charges. 
 
 Her lawyer, Richard Portale, requested she be released on her own recognizance. The judge set her bail at $3 million or $9 million bond. Graswald is in Orange County Jail. 
 
 Graswald was beneficiary on two of Viafore's life insurance policies, and stood to gain $250,000 from his death, said Assistant District Attorney Julie Mohl. 
 
 State police shared a photo of the kayaks Angelika Graswald and Vincent Viafore used on the day of his death at a 2015 press conference. Viafore was in the blue kayak, police said. (Photo: State police) 
 
 Graswald and Viafore, a 46-year-old Poughkeepsie resident, left Plum Point in kayaks around 4:15 p.m. on April 19. They kayaked to Bannerman Island, where Graswald was a volunteer, and stayed about two hours, Mohl said. 
 
 When the couple was about two-thirds of the way back, ""the victim's kayak filled with water, causing it to capsize,"" Mohl said. ""The victim was holding onto the kayak...he went under water and drowned,"" around 7:15 p.m. 
 
 Graswald did not call for help until 7:40 p.m., Mohl said. While she was on the phone with 911, Graswald said she could see Viafore, and the call was cut off when she herself capsized, Mohl said. 
 
 Witnesses say they saw Graswald ""intentionally"" capsized, and when she was questioned about inconsistencies in her statements, ""she said she capsized her kayak on purposely,"" because she wanted authorities to believe she tried to save Viafore, Mohl said. ""She stated that she tampered with the victim's kayak...she knew it would contribute to his death."" 
 
 Graswald told authorities she ""felt happiness and relief"" as she watched him go into the water, Mohl said. Graswald said ""it felt good knowing he was going to die,"" and that she felt trapped in the relationship with him. 
 
 Graswald detailed where the equipment could be found, but not Viafore's body, Mohl added. 
 
 State police are still searching for Viafore's body. 
 
 Graswald was also aware that she was the primary beneficiary on two of Viafore's life insurance policies, and ""talked about what she could do with the money"" after his death, Mohl said. 
 
 Portale said he has reason to believe any statements Graswald made were coerced. 
 
 Graswald, who is originally from Latvia and is in the US with a permanent resident card, is ""very confident sounding, so even if she doesn't understand what you're saying, she'll answer in an affirmative tone,"" Portale said. ""She was suffering from hypothermia and the loss of her fiance, and there was a very clear language barrier."" 
 
 Police originally said there were inconsistencies in Graswald's statements. 
 
 And there's a big difference between inconsistencies and a confession, Portale said. 
 
 ""What's changed that has caused the government to now characterize my client's statements as a confession?"" Portale added, ""unless we were misled"" by police in the first place. ""It's all going to come out"" and the defense will get ""our hands on the statements, and find out whether they were voluntary or forced."" 
 
 Despite the $3 million bail, Portale classified the hearing as a ""success. The mission today was to find out what, if anything, the indictment was for."" 
 
 As for Graswald, Portale said she is ""depressed, shes hurting...(but) she's confident that by the time this is over, the truth is going to come out.

 Read or Share this story: http://pojonews.co/1bQ7pLS ||||| Prosecutors at a bail hearing in Orange County, N.Y., on Wednesday said that Angelika Graswald, the woman accused of intentionally drowning her fiancé in the Hudson River last month, had told the police that she tampered with his kayak and had said it “felt good knowing he was going to die.” 
 
 When the police announced the arrest of Ms. Graswald on a charge of second-degree murder, they described what they called “inconsistencies in her statements” that implicated her in the death of Vincent Viafore, whose body has not been found. 
 
 But at the hearing, prosecutors went further, said the district attorney’s spokesman, Christopher Borek, and quoted Ms. Graswald in what sounded more like a confession. 
 
 Julie Mohl, an assistant district attorney, said Ms. Graswald, 35, was aware that she was the beneficiary in two life insurance policies belonging to Mr. Viafore, who was 46. Ms. Mohl said that Ms. Graswald stood to gain $250,000 and “talked about what she could do with the money” after his death. ||||| Angelika Graswald, second from left, stands in court with Michael Archer, left, a forensic scientist, as her attorneys Jeffrey Chartier and Richard Portale, right, ask for bail and to unseal the indictment... (Associated Press) 
 
 GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) — A woman accused of killing her fiance while out paddling on the Hudson River admitted tampering with his kayak and later confessed ""it felt good knowing he would die,"" a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
 
 Angelika Graswald, 35, has been indicted on a second-degree murder charge in the death of Vincent Viafore in choppy, chilly water on the evening of April 19. Police say he died 50 miles north of New York City near Bannerman Island, a scenic ruin near the east shore where the longtime U.S. resident from Latvia volunteered as a gardener. 
 
 Viafore, 46, was not wearing a life jacket and his body hasn't been found. 
 
 Assistant District Attorney Julie Mohl said at a bail hearing Wednesday that Graswald felt trapped and stood to benefit by $250,000 from life insurance policies. Mohl did not detail how Graswald tampered with her fiance's kayak but said it filled with water and capsized. Viafore held onto his boat for 5 to 10 minutes, but Graswald called 911 some 20 minutes after his kayak capsized. Witnesses say she intentionally capsized her own kayak, Mohl said. 
 
 ""She felt trapped and it was her only way out,"" Mohl said. 
 
 Graswald was rescued by another boater and treated for hypothermia. 
 
 She later told investigators that she felt relief and ""it felt good knowing he would die,"" Mohl said. 
 
 The judge set bail for Graswald, who appeared in court in shackles and an orange jumpsuit, at $3 million cash. 
 
 After the hearing, defense attorney Richard Portale noted the language barrier between Graswald and investigators. He said he would look into whether her statements were voluntary. 
 
 ""I'm skeptical of the statements,"" he said. 
 
 Since her arrest almost two weeks ago, those who know Graswald have been trying to square the fun-loving woman they knew with the killer described by authorities. 
 
 ""The bubbly, bouncy little ballerina girl had a dark side,"" said Mike Colvin, a disc jockey in Poughkeepsie she lived with from November 2008 to June 2010. Still, he never saw Graswald act in a way that suggested violence. 
 
 Graswald could walk into a room full of strangers and know everyone's name by the time she left, Colvin said. But he said he also had authority issues and could make unwise snap decisions when angry. She had run through two marriages and a string of jobs by her mid-30s. The impulsiveness apparently contributed to her checkered job history at restaurants and other businesses. 
 
 ""They would have staff meetings, and she would just lose it, and eventually she'd have to be let go,"" Colvin said. ""This happened more than once. Not a big fan of authority."" 
 
 Graswald and Viafore appeared to be a happy couple. 
 
 Images posted online show an active, affectionate pair spending time outdoors, particularly on the water, and a message about their plans to be married at a spot on the Baltic Sea. Sean Von Clauss, a professional musician from Boston who had known Viafore since boyhood, recalls how the couple would affectionately slow dance when he performed ""Shama Lama Ding Dong."" 
 
 ""They were always in love — singing, dancing and holding. They were always together,"" Von Clauss said. ""He was thrilled that he found his soul mate."" 
 
 Viafore had a booming laugh and loved to socialize — the kind of guy who would pick up the check, Von Clauss said. 
 
 Von Clauss said he saw Graswald the Friday before her arrest at a gathering to remember Viafore at a bar. She brought a poster board covered with pictures and asked Von Clauss to play ""Shama Lama Ding Dong."" Usually they would play ""Hotel California"" together, but she asked him to play solo that night. Then she forgot the words. 
 
 ""We all kind of sang along, then she sort of finished it by herself,"" he said. ""We all gave her a big round of applause anyway.""

33,"Stephen Colbert has technically colluded with Russia. 
 
 The host of The Late Show went abroad to Saint Petersburg, where he met his Russian late-night TV host equivalent, Ivan Urgant, and appeared on his show, Evening Urgant. The pair threw back vodka shots, joked about Russian interference with the U.S. election, and mocked President Donald Trump. 
 
 “I am so honored to be here right now because you are the No. 1 show here, and this is the state TV, so you’re officially an employee of the state and we agreed that I would appear here on the show,” Colbert told Urgant in front of his television audience. “We, uh, what’s the word for it? We colluded that I would be here on the show, and so I look forward to going back to America and testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee about colluding with Russians.” 
 
 During an off-air chat with Colbert, Urgant described his show as more Jimmy Fallon than John Oliver. To that end, they played one of his games called Russian Russian Roulette. It wasn’t complicated: they each took turns spinning a turntable full of shot glasses until the arrow landed on one. They were all filled with vodka, so it proved to be the ultimate drinking game that guaranteed a buzz. 
 
 Since this Russian government-approved television show would probably not be available in the U.S. — other than in Trump Tower, Urgant joked — Colbert took this opportunity to announce his bid for the 2020 presidential election. “I thought it would be great to cut out the middle man and tell the Russians myself: If anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity, please,” he joked.

 The 'Late Show' host's recent trip to the country will be broadcast in five new episodes starting July 17. 
 
 Stephen Colbert kicked off day one of ""Russia Week"" on The Late Show with more jabs at Donald Trump Jr.'s Russian ties and new footage of Colbert's recent trip to the country. 
 
 ""I just want to get out ahead of the story here — I recently met with a lot of Russians. I can't remember why — maybe because I was in Russia. Some of them work for the government,"" Colbert teased in his opening monologue. ""I didn't think you'd find out; the whole week was supposed to be a secret. But someone leaked it to CBS' marketing department,"" he said, then mouthed, ""I did."" 
 
 Before diving into his Russia visit, Colbert took a moment to discuss what's been pervading the news cycle in the U.S.: Russia. 
 
 The host once again tackled the topic of Trump Jr.'s private meeting last year with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, who ""is reportedly a former Soviet counterintelligence officer."" 
 
 ""Of course, when it comes to Don Jr. there's not much intelligence to counter,"" Colbert added. ""Here's the deal: Akhmetshin denies any current ties to Russian spy agencies, so you know it must be true. Remember the first rule of spy club: tell everyone you're in spy club."" 
 
 Colbert also took aim at the White House's declaration of ""Made in America"" week, noting that the announcement was possibly made to distract from the fact that Trump's ""campaign was made in Russia."" 
 
 Monday's episode of The Late Show broadcast the first few clips from Colbert's trip to Russia, during which he made a guest appearance on Russian talk show Evening Urgant and took to the streets of St. Petersburg to mingle with passersby. 
 
 Colbert aired footage of his backstage chat with fellow talk show host Ivan Urgant about ""restrictions"" on what can and cannot be said on late-night TV in Russia. 
 
 ""Do you talk about Trump on your show? We talk about him all the time,"" Colbert said to Urgant, who replied, ""That's why you guys are No. 1 now in the States."" In terms of how much politics are covered on his show, Urgant noted, ""We're more close to [Jimmy] Fallon than to John Oliver."" 
 
 During Colbert's live taping at Evening Urgant, video of which was posted online last month, the host jokingly announced he was considering a 2020 presidential run, telling the audience, ""I thought it would be better to cut out the middleman and just tell the Russians myself. If anyone would like to work on my campaign, in an unofficial capacity, please just let me know."" 
 
 He also made it clear that in arranging his guest appearance on the show, he and Urgant had been working in collusion. ""We agreed that I would be on the show — we colluded that I would be on the show,"" he joked, adding that he couldn't wait to testify before the Senate committee about colluding with Russia. 
 
 ""Russia Week"" will continue Tuesday with clips from Colbert's stay in the Ritz-Carlton's Presidential Suite (""Yes, that one"") and conversation with Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov set to air in the next few days. ||||| Published on Jul 18, 2017

The CBS host launched ""Russia Week"" on Monday night following his visit to the country, per the Hollywood Reporter. Colbert will be airing pieces from his trip all week, and his first was on his visit to a Colbert-like figure in Russia, TV host Ivan Urgant. Colbert appeared on Urgant's Russian show, where he mocked Trump, drank vodka, and announced his own supposed bid for the White House in 2020. ""I thought it would just be better to cut out the middle man and just tell the Russians myself: If anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity, please, just let me know,"" he said, per Entertainment Weekly.

34,"Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, canceled a scheduled all-hands staff meeting—moments before it was scheduled to begin—meant to address concerns over a controversial essay published by former employee James Damore. 
 
 In an email to staff, Pichai explained that questions from employees had been leaked and that, in some cases, specific employees' identities were revealed, exposing them to harassment and threats. Instead of today's large-scale meeting, which was to be livestreamed to Google's 60,000 employees worldwide, smaller groups will meet sometime in the future. 
 
 ""We had hoped to have a frank open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally,"" Pichai said in the email. 
 
 Pichai said in the email that while the majority of Googlers were supportive of the decision, some wished the company would do more. He said some also worried about not being able to speak freely at work. 
 
 ""All of your voices and opinions matter and I want to hear them,"" he said. 
 
 Earlier in the day, questions began to be posted to Google's internal message boards that were to be included in today's planned meeting. 
 
 ""Can we get an update on progress toward identifying leakers?"" one employee posted, saying multiple Googlers had their team pages leaked to alt-right sites, resulting in a death threat in one instance. 
 
 ""I am a moderately conservative Googler,"" wrote one employee, ""and I am and have been scared to share my beliefs. The loud voice here is a liberal one. Conservative voices are hushed. What is leadership doing to ensure Googlers like me feel *invited and accepted*, not just tolerated or safe from angry mobs?"" 
 
 Another question asked how to combat Damore's assertion that Google has a lower bar for diversity candidates. ""This is hurting minority Googlers because it creates the perception they are less qualified,"" an employee wrote. 
 
 Pichai, who said that parts of Damore's manifesto violated Google's code of conduct, had cut his vacation short to attend today's schediuled meeting. 
 
 ""Clearly there's a lot more to discuss as a group -- including how we create a more inclusive environment for all,"" he wrote in an email sent to employees Tuesday. 
 
 Damore's 3,300 word manifesto claims there aren't more women in tech roles due to ""biological causes"" while also calling Google left-leaning with a ""politically correct monoculture."" The memo has spurred a conversation about systematic sexism in Silicon Valley, as well as what is and is not acceptable to debate in a workplace environment. ||||| Google CEO Sundar Pichai has canceled the company’s much-anticipated meeting to talk about gender issues today. The move came after some of its employees expressed concern over online harassment they had begun to receive after their questions and names have been published outside the company on a variety of largely alt-right sites. 
 
 “We had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally,” wrote Pichai to employees. “Googlers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be ‘outed’ publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall.” 
 
 Pichai was set to address the search giant’s 60,000 employees in 30 minutes in an all-hands meeting about a recent post by recently fired employee James Damore. In it, the software engineer claimed that women might not be as good as men at tech because of biological reasons, like “neuroticism.” In other words, they could not handle stress and high pressure as much. 
 
 Speaking of high pressure, Google is under that for sure in the wake of Damore’s blog and the reaction it has engendered from outside the company, especially among deeply conservative sites like Breitbart and others. 
 
 Wired reported earlier that conservative pundit Milo Yiannopoulos “posted on his Facebook page the Twitter biographies of eight Google employees who criticized Damore’s post.” 
 
 Sources inside Google said some employees had begun to experience “doxxing” — online harassment that can take various forms and is defined as “searching for and publishing private or identifying information about [a particular individual] on the internet, typically with malicious intent.” 
 
 Several sites like this one have been publishing internal discussion posts and giving out information on those employees. 
 
 In addition, in a move that many Googlers found already disturbing, Damore did his first major interview with alt-right YouTube personality, Stefan Molyneux (ironic, I know, since Google owns the online video giant). You can see that below. 
 
 In subsequent interviews, Damore said he had been “smeared” and “shamed” by top execs for his post. 
 
 That seems a little bit of a reach since he appears to have intended to throw an atom bomb with it. For example, Damore wrote: “I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.” 
 
 What followed was a list of those differences, including a claim that women were more social and artistic and could not take the stress of high-pressure jobs. Hence, “neuroticism,” or higher anxiety and lower stress tolerance, which he claimed was backed up by studies. 
 
 Perhaps most disingenuously, the author also claimed that he had no voice, even after penning a 3,000-word memo that he was able to send companywide and also was read by millions more. 
 
 It was probably no surprise that Pichai fired Damore earlier this week for violating Google’s Code of Conduct, noting in an email to staff that “to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.” 
 
 Since then, it’s been a tense time for Google and also Silicon Valley, which has been reeling for months amid sexual harassment controversies at companies like Uber and at venture capital firms. While issues around gender and diversity have been a hot-button issue for a long time, the simmering has turned to boiling now. 
 
 That has been made worse by the political environment nationwide, which has gotten rather divisive of late. 
 
 So goes the country, it seems, so goes tech. 
 
 Here is Pichai’s letter: 
 
 Dear Googlers, TL;DR Sorry for the late notice but we are going to cancel today’s Town Hall. We had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally. Googlers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be “outed” publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall. In recognition of Googlers’ concerns, we need to step back and create a better set of conditions for us to have the discussion. So in the coming days we will find several forums to gather and engage with Googlers, where people can feel comfortable to speak freely. We’ll share details soon. Over the past two days, I have had the chance to meet with so many people here, and I have read each of your emails carefully. The vast majority of you are very supportive of our decision. A smaller percentage of you wish we would do more. And some are worried that you cannot speak out at work freely. All of your voices and opinions matter ... and I want to hear them. In the meantime, let’s not forget what unites us as a company — our desire to build great products for everyone that make a big difference in their lives. I have been in a few product discussions today and felt energized by the important things we are working on. We can, and will continue, to come together to do the very best for the people we serve. Stay tuned. Sundar ||||| Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, speaking at a coding event for girls happening at Google’s campus today, emphasized the importance of engineers “building products for everyone in the world,” and said that in order to do that, “we need to have people internally who represent the world in totality.” 
 
 “I want you to know there’s a place for you in this industry,” Pichai said to the teams of young women who were finalists in a months-long app-building competition. “There’s a place for you at Google. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. You belong here, and we need you.” 
 
 Pichai’s remarks were especially noteworthy because of their juxtaposition with the controversy happening at Google right now, after a software engineer posted a diversity-related memo that went viral both within the company and in public sphere. The author of the memo, which questioned Google’s diversity training and women’s aptitude for coding, has since been fired from the company, and has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. 
 
 The public appearance by Pichai also came just after Google canceled a company-wide town hall meeting, which had been scheduled to address some of the fallout from the memo. The meeting was canceled, according to a report in Recode, after employees who had sent preliminary questions started getting harassed online. 
 
 “It's really important that more women and girls have the opportunity to participate in technology, to learn how to code, create, and innovate,” Pichai said. 
 
 “Seeing the girls here tonight gives me hope for the future.” 
 
 The coding event this evening was co-hosted by Iridescent Learning, an LA-based nonprofit that has run the Technovation competition for the past several years. Google offers a variety of education opportunities focused on coding, as do many other large tech companies; this event was a part of its “Made with Code” program, aimed at young women. 
 
 Of course, as with other workshops, coding camps, and initiatives that tech companies offer, many of them still struggle with creating truly diverse workplaces, as their volunteered annual reports have shown.

35,"Herman Cain expressed confidence at Tuesday’s debate that his much-touted “9-9-9” plan to revamp the tax code would pass Congress, but the paid campaign consultant who scored the plan for Cain said the idea was more of a theory than a politically viable solution — and not the route he would suggest himself. 
 
 “You’re trying to go to a system that taxes income once and only once and quits double-taxing savings,” Gary Robbins told POLITICO on Wednesday. “That’s something that can really juice the economy, it’s probably worth 15 percent in growth. … The problem with the big-bang changes like that, the flat tax or the fair tax, is that they are so alien to the current system that it would be a great big shock.”

 Though Robbins says the plan would work fiscally and economically, he believes people would never accept such drastic changes. 
 
 Cain has repeatedly declined to name the people involved with crafting the plan besides Rich Lowrie, Cain’s chief economic adviser, a Cleveland-based wealth manager for Wells Fargo who is not a trained economist. But it was Robbins, an economist who has worked for Steve Forbes’s flat-tax campaigns and was a longtime Treasury employee, who conducted a 10-page analysis of the plan in September. Robbins found the plan to be revenue neutral, as Cain’s been trumpeting in recent debates and in interviews. 
 
 “Economically, it’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with the plan and nothing wrong with the proposal,” Robbins said. “What Cain has done is really smart and saying if you go this route, this is the way to go. He’s done a very good job and the fellows who were beating on him last night were making a mistake.” 
 
 Robbins said he’s performed various economics-related tasks for the campaign. He said he answers questions from Lowrie as recently as this week in response to a scathing Wall Street Journal editorial that picked apart the 9-9-9 plan. 
 
 “They are really technical questions about how you describe things,” Robbins said. “He wanted to make sure he was describing faithfully what was happening.” 
 
 Cain spokesman J.D. Gordon confirmed that Robbins scored the 9-9-9 plan for the campaign but declined to address other questions about him. Lowrie did not immediately respond to emails sent to his personal and campaign accounts. 
 
 Robbins, who with his wife runs an Arlington operation called Fiscal Policy Associates, Inc., was once a senior fellow at the Texas-based Institute for Policy Innovation. In 2003, Jude Wanniski, who is credited with coining the phrase “supply-side economics,” wrote in a Washington Times op-ed that Robbins is “arguably the most respected of all supply-side tax experts.” 
 
 Robbins said he served for 16 years in the Treasury Department, leaving in 1985 after working as economist in the Office of Tax Policy and for Ronald Reagan’s assistant secretary for economic affairs. He has a bachelor’s degree in math and physics from Texas Tech University and a master’s degree in economics from Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
 
 While Robbins praised the idea of 9-9-9, he took steps during an interview to distance himself from its author. 
 
 “It’s not a plan that I concocted,” Robbins said. “There’s nothing wrong with the plan, it just wouldn’t be the one I picked.” |||||

 “9-9-9 will pass, and it is not the price of pizza because, it has been well-studied and well-developed… The problem with that analysis [that it will not raise enough revenue] is that it is incorrect. The reason it's incorrect is because they start with assumptions that we don't make. Remember, 9- 9-9 plan throws out the current tax code. ... Now, what 9-9-9 does, it expands the base. When you expand the base, we can arrive at the lowest possible rate, which is 9-9-9.” 
 
 — Herman Cain, Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, October 11, 2011 
 
 A family of four making $50,000 a year “are still going to have some money left over.” 
 
 — Cain, on MSNBC, October 12, 2011 
 
 It almost sounds like something out of the movie “Dave,” in which the accidental president enlists his accountant friend, Murray Blum, to help him figure out the federal budget. 
 
 During Tuesday’s Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza, named Rich Lowrie of Cleveland as “my lead economist” who helped develop Cain’s signature “9-9-9” plan for overhauling the federal tax system. “He is an economist, and he has worked in the business of wealth creation most of his career,” Cain said. 
 
 Actually, according to Lowrie’s Linked-In profile, he has a bachelor’s degree in accountancy from Case Western Reserve University, not economics. Lowrie, in an e-mail, said he did not consider himself an economist, just “senior economic advisor” to the Cain campaign. Donor information maintained by Opensecrets.org shows he has donated $1,500 to Cain in 2010 and 2011, but also contributed $2,300 to Mitt Romney in his first run for the presidency in 2007. 
 
 Okay, so Cain may have exaggerated the qualifications of his economic guru. But he has forcefully defended his ‘9-9-9’ plan, both during Tuesday night’s debate and on MSNBC’s “Daily Rundown” on Wednesday. Many readers have asked us to examine the plan and explain it, so let’s take it for a test drive. 
 
 The Facts 
 
 The “9-9-9” label is actually a bit of misnomer. Cain would toss out much of the current federal tax code and replace it, eventually and only temporarily, with three taxes — a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent business transactions tax and a 9 percent federal sales tax. On paper, the first two look like cuts, because payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare (now nearly 15 percent, including corporate contributions) would be repealed. The sales tax would be new, on top of existing state sales taxes. 
 
 But note that we said the “9-9-9” would happen eventually — and then only temporarily. That’s because it is only the second step of a planned three-step process. The first step would cut individual and corporate tax rates to a top 25 percent rate (down from a current high of 35 percent). Then the final step would replace all of the taxes — even the 9s — with a national sales tax, known by proponents as a “Fair Tax.” 
 
 (As denizens of Washington, we find this three-step process to be highly dubious. It takes years, even decades, to fundamentally overhaul the tax code. Herman Cain is going to do this three times in his presidency? But we digress.) 
 
 Much attention has focused on whether Cain’s plan, in its 9-9-9 stage, would raise as much revenue as the current tax system. Bloomberg News had calculated it would collect about $2 trillion, thus falling short by about $200 billion a year. But Lowrie sent Bloomberg an analysis on Wednesday that asserted “9-9-9” would actually collect slightly more — $2.3 trillion. 
 
 We think the revenue question is beside the point. Anyone can turn the dials in their computer models to generate the assumptions they want. 
 
 Michael Linden of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, for instance, estimates the plan would generate just $1.3 trillion. The biggest difference between the two estimates is that Linden thinks the 9 percent business tax would yield $112 billion a year, and Cain says he would get $862 billion — a gap that simply demonstrates how a few different assumptions can generate extremely different results. (Linden on Thursday updated his analysis, saying he had underestimated how much revenue the business tax would raise.) 
 
 Cain’s proposal is so radical that it makes more sense to examine the potential impact on taxpayers. A key part of Cain’s pitch for the plan during the debate was this: “When you expand the base, we can arrive at the lowest possible rate, which is 9-9-9.” 
 
 “Expand the base” really means that more taxpayers will pay taxes under his plan. 
 
 Right now, nearly half of taxpayers don’t pay income taxes, but they do pay their share of payroll taxes, which amounts to 7.65 percent of wage income (though much of it is capped at $107,000). Cain would also eliminate the earned-income tax credit, which is intended to lift working Americans out of poverty. Many of these workers currently receive tax refunds. 
 
 On top of that, Cain would introduce the new sales tax, which would affect lower and moderate-income people who spend most of their income on purchases, not savings and investments. Depending on how you do the math, people now paying zero or negative taxes might be faced with a 27 percent tax on income. 
 
 In other words, while on paper Cain is promising a tax cut, in reality tens of millions of lower-income Americans would face tax increases. People in high tax brackets — 28 percent and higher — would likely see big tax cuts. (As part of his plan, Cain would also eliminate estate taxes and capital gains taxes, which, again, mostly affect higher-income people with stock and real estate investments.) 
 
 There have been several interesting analyses done on the “9-9-9” plan. Edward D. Kleinbard of the University of Southern California School of Law identifies several unusual quirks, including a “disguised one-time 9 percent tax on existing wealth — no doubt much to the surprise of Mr. Cain and his followers.” Kleinbard, former chief of staff of the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, says that “contrary to casual impressions, the Plan could be expected to raise substantial amounts of revenue, but does so largely by skewing downwards the distribution of tax burdens when compared to current law.” 
 
 Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan administration official who now calls himself an independent, also offered a critical examination this week on the New York Times Economix blog. He (as did Kleinbard) noted that the business tax allows for no deduction for wages, which he said “is likely to raise the cost of employing workers, even with abolition of the employers’ share of the payroll tax.” 
 
 Cain, in his television appearances, glosses over such details. “The fact that we are taking out embedded taxes that are built into all of the goods and services in this country, prices will not go up,” he asserted on MSNBC. “They will not go up.” He then gave an example of a family of four earning $50,000. 
 
 “Today, under the current system, they will pay over $10,000 in taxes assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions. I've gone through the math, $10,000. Now, with 9-9-9, they're going to pay that 9 percent personal — that 9 percent tax on their income. So that's only $4,500. They still have $5,500 left over to apply to this sales tax piece. …They are still going to have money left over.” 
 
 We’re not sure how Cain calculates that this family now pays $10,000 in taxes, but the reliable Tax Foundation calculator comes up with a much more reasonable figure: a total tax bill of $3,515 — $690 in federal income taxes and $2,825 in payroll taxes. (The family gets a big income-tax savings from the child tax credit, which Cain would eliminate.) 
 
 So, in other words, under Cain’s plan, this family would instantly pay $1,000 more in income taxes. They would also pay additional sales taxes, probably more than $3,000, on their purchases. It’s unclear how the business tax would affect the family’s tax bill but it appears this theoretical family would get no tax cut but instead a 100 percent tax increase. 
 
 (The picture changes somewhat if you assume that all the employer-paid payroll taxes automatically would revert to the employee. We’re not sure that’s a good bet given the design of Cain’s business tax, but pro-Cain advocates make that assumption with their own tax calculator. But even under this scenario, the family appears stuck with at least a $2,000 tax increase.) 
 
 We take no position on whether it is good or bad to make the tax code less progressive. Perhaps in response to questions, Cain appears to still be tinkering with the plan. In Concord, N.H., he said on Wednesday that, among other changes, he would preserve the deduction for charitable donations and would exempt any used goods, including previously owned homes and cars, from the new 9 percent sales tax. 
 
 The Pinocchio Test 
 
 We can excuse Cain inflating his adviser’s resume, but his campaign needs to do more to address the fuzzy math behind his tax plan. (We asked the campaign for a copy of Lowrie’s analysis but did not receive a response. UPDATE: The documents are posted below.) 
 
 Give Cain credit for thinking boldly, but he’s not talking clearly. As far as we can tell from the limited information Cain has provided, the plan he touts as a big tax cut would actually increase taxes on most Americans. Just like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, Cain’s description of the plan’s impact on working Americans is highly misleading.

The plan would replace the tax code with a 9% corporate tax, 9% income tax and 9% federal sales tax, which would amount to a big tax cut for the wealthy, who spend little of their income, but a big tax increase for most other families, since it eliminates the deductions they rely on. “Just like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, Cain’s description of the plan’s impact on working Americans is highly misleading,” Kessler concludes.

 Lovato has long battled addiction, mental illness and disordered eating. 
 
 The Disney Channel alum entered treatment in 2010, where she received professional assistance for bipolar disorder, bulimia, self-harm and addiction. Lovato relapsed after she left the treatment center, then entered a sober living facility for a year. 
 
 But even after treatment, insiders say she still struggled with her private pain. “Demi was never really clean and sober from all of her demons,” a Lovato source previously told PEOPLE. “She has been fighting depression and anxiety for quite some time — and is still in such a dark place.

 ""Instead of doing the right thing and making an anonymous call to 911 or leaving because there was a dead person there, they decided to take the body, bring it back to their place, wrap it in a tent and cover it with hay,"" Troyer said. 
 
 
 
 The men then went back into her home and began the process of cleaning her out. 
 
 
 
 ""They took her antiques, her vehicles and put them in their name and sold them,"" Troyer said. ""Then took her identity and her bank cards and tried to steal her money as well."" 
 
 
 
 It was eagle-eye security officials at the Boeing Employees Credit Union that realized something was up when there was a spur of activity on the account of a woman who had been reported missing, Troyer said. That led police to the two men. 
 
 
 
 Police searched the men's home with cadaver dogs and they were able to locate the woman's body. An autopsy was conducted on the woman, which showed she probably died of natural causes.

One of the main topics of discussion at this annual meeting will be the recent unrest outside U.S. embassies in the Muslim world, including an attack in Benghazi, Libya, which claimed the lives of four Americans. But unlike years past, the president will not be sitting down with any of the more than 120 world leaders who are here in New York. 
 
 Simply put, the White House is prioritizing the president's reelection effort. Most heads of state will be here all week, but the president will be in New York less than 24 hours, and even then will spend most of his time away from this conference. 
 
 After landing in New York Monday afternoon, the president headed straight for a sit-down -- not with visiting leaders, but with the ladies of ""The View,"" for an interview to air tomorrow. 
 
 Last year at the U.N. General Assembly, President Obama held 13 one-on-one meetings with major leaders. 
 
 But this year diplomacy is taking a back seat to campaigning, despite a worsening civil war in Syria, rising tensions between Israel and Iran, and the recent attack in Libya. 
 
 In the president's absence, it was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who met with Libya's president Monday, as well as the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 
 ""The president and the Libyan government have been staunch partners to the United States,"" Clinton said. 
 
 White House spokesman Jay Carney pointed out Mr. Obama is hosting two receptions for world leaders tonight, and speaks with them on the phone all the time. 
 
 ""The fact of the matter is, the president does not wait for an annual meeting to have consultations with or meetings with foreign leaders, and they will continue,"" Carney said. 
 
 The president will lay out a set of priorities for the U.N. General Assembly in a speech Tuesday morning, but he flies back to Washington a few hours later and then makes a campaign trip to Ohio on Wednesday. ||||| NEW YORK—President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama bantered playfully and held hands Monday during a taping of the female-oriented talk show, ""The View,"" giving no indication of second thoughts about the appearance despite criticism that the president was blowing off international diplomacy in order to take part in the often-fluffy daytime gabfest. 
 
 ""I told folks I'm just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys,"" President Obama said during a back-and-forth about him being the only man on the program. The show's five co-hosts are women. 
 
 The first lady played along by letting the audience in—just a tad—on their relationship and even some of their marital spats. 
 
 ""He's very loving, he's very giving. He's very open. He's funny; I'm funnier,"" Mrs. Obama said when asked to describe her husband's personality. 
 
 Asked whether her husband ever gets angry, she replied: ""Yeah, yeah, he does. I can make him mad -- any number of ways."" 
 
 ""By being thoroughly unreasonable,"" the president jumped in, smiling, according to a pool report. 
 
 The Obamas also talked about their 20th wedding anniversary falling on Oct. 3—the night of the first presidential debate. President Obama said the couple will celebrate the following Saturday. 
 
 ""I like lavishing her with all kinds of attention when she deserves it, and she always deserves it,"" the president said. 
 
 President Obama also said the couple's daughters, Malia and Sasha, are becoming more independent and no longer seem eager to hang out with their father. 
 
 ""They're now at the point where, they still love their daddy, but they come in [to visit him] strategically. They're not being surly or anything,"" Obama said, while adding that the children now pay about a five-minute visit and then take off. 
 
 ""The View"" program the Obamas taped Monday is set to air Tuesday, taking the first couple in front of a politically-coveted heavily-female audience six weeks before the November election.

 As dozens of world leaders gathered for the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly — choking Manhattan’s streets with motorcades and barricades — the contrast between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton could not have been starker. 
 
 Mr. Obama, his re-election campaign in full swing, continued to make his pitch to American voters, avoiding for the most part world leaders arriving at the United Nations. The president will address the General Assembly on Tuesday but, breaking with tradition, has no meetings set with his counterparts. 
 
 That task he delegated to Mrs. Clinton, who churned through the first of dozens of meetings she will have over the next week. They deal with some of the most pressing foreign policy crises the administration has faced since taking office in 2009, like the deadly protests in the Islamic world and the confrontation between Japan and China over a handful of unpopulated islands. 
 
 Mrs. Clinton met President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan (“It’s been a difficult time for all of us,” he told her after riots protesting a video made in the United States that denigrates the Prophet Muhammad) as well as Mr. Karzai. By the end of a 12-hour day, she had also met with President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, with whom she discussed issues including the security of the American Embassy in Cairo, relations with Israel and Egypt’s economy. 
 
 The meeting seemed to repair possible hard feelings over President Obama’s recent refusal to call Egypt either a friend or an enemy despite decades of close ties. “We moved past that,” a senior administration official said late Monday night. 
 
 Earlier, another administration official said much the same thing about Pakistan, describing Mrs. Clinton’s meeting with Mr. Zardari and Pakistan’s foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, as representing a “re-energized dialogue at the highest levels” — if not the very highest level, with Mr. Obama. 
 
 In between, Mrs. Clinton held an emotional meeting with President Mohamed Magariaf of Libya, who reiterated his apologies for the Sept. 11 killings of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi. He noted the counterprotests, held in Benghazi and other Libyan cities on Friday, that expressed support for the United States. 
 
 “Madam Secretary,” he said, speaking softly in a conference room at the American suite in the Waldorf-Astoria, “I also seize this opportunity to reaffirm that what happened on 11th of September towards these U.S. citizens does not express in any way the conscience of the Libyan people, their aspirations, their hopes or their sentiments towards the American people.” 
 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Obama was filming a segment for “The View,” the talk show hosted by Whoopi Goldberg and a quartet of sharp-tongued television celebrities. Mr. Obama arrived on the set with a basket of gifts, including home-brewed White House beer for the co-host Barbara Walters, whose birthday is Tuesday. 
 
 With his wife, Michelle Obama, by his side, the president was quipping with the six women in no time: “I told folks I’m just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys.” He chatted about not-so-weighty topics like the first couple’s 20th wedding anniversary on Oct. 3, the night of the first presidential debate with Mitt Romney. 
 
 Mr. Obama said he had wisely decided to celebrate with his wife the following Saturday. 
 
 A moment of foreign policy gravitas occurred when Mr. Obama, asked whether the attack in Libya was an act of terrorism, said: “There’s no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing assault, that it wasn’t just a mob action.” In what may have been a preview of his General Assembly speech, he added: “The overwhelming majority of Muslims, they want the same things that families here want. They want opportunity, kids want an education, they want jobs, they want peace. But there are extremist strains that are there.” 
 
 White House aides, who have been getting an earful for the past few days about the president’s light schedule, sought to focus attention on Mr. Obama’s speech on Tuesday. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Obama would address anti-American protests that have been unfolding in the Arab world. 
 
 “I would expect the president to address the recent unrest in the Muslim world and the broader context of the democratic transitions of the Arab world,” Mr. Carney said. 
 
 He added that the speech would also give Mr. Obama another opportunity “to underscore that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.” 
 
 Mr. Obama was scheduled to attend a reception for world leaders at the United Nations on Monday night. But a campaign adviser acknowledged privately that in this election year, campaigning trumped meetings with world leaders. “Look, if he met with one leader, he would have to meet with 10,” the aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ||||| Bloomberg View columnist William Cohan and Democratic strategist Julian Epstein discuss why Mitt Romney is still fumbling for answers over his 2011 tax return – despite their Friday release – and whether he’ll ever be able to explain how he pays for his proposed, across-the-board tax cuts. 
 
 DENVER -- Mitt Romney today attempted to shift focus to what he called President Barack Obama's lack of leadership in the Middle East, as world leaders began to gather in New York City for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. 
 
 The Romney campaign this afternoon offered a series of interviews with major U.S. TV networks, in which Romney hammered Obama for referring to a series of flare-ups in the Middle East as ""bumps in the road."" 
 
 In Colorado, Mitt Romney insisted to NBC News that he'll win. The Obama campaign, meanwhile, has unveiled a new TV ad tying Romney's tax returns with his comments about the 47 percent. NBC's Chuck Todd reports. 
 
 ""When the president was speaking about 'bumps in the road' he was talking about the developments in the Middle East, and that includes an assassination. It includes a Muslim Brotherhood individual becoming president of Egypt. It includes Syria being in tumult,"" Romney told NBC's Peter Alexander. ""It includes Iran being on the cusp of nuclear capability. It includes Pakistan being in commotion."" 
 
 Mitt Romney will stump in Colorado on Monday and then travel to Ohio via bus tour all ahead of next week's first debate. The Daily Rundown's Chuck Todd reports. 
 
 Romney continued, ""There are extraordinary events going on in the Middle East, and considering those events, either one of them or all of them collectively, as bumps in the road shows a person who has a very different perspective about world affairs than the perspective I have. I think this is a time for America to exert leadership and this is not something that we are doing in the Middle East ... ."" 
 
 Romney was referring to an answer Obama gave in an interview which aired last night on CBS News' ""60 Minutes,"" in which the president defended his support for emerging governments in the Middle East as a result of the Arab spring. 
 
 Charles Dharapak / AP Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney boards his plane in Denver, Monday, Sept. 24, 2012. 
 
 Kroft: Have the events that took place in the Middle East, the recent events in the Middle East given you any pause about your support for the governments that have come to power following the Arab Spring? 
 
 Obama: Well, I'd said even at the time that this is going to be a rocky path. The question presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change. I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights, a notion that people have to be able to participate in their own governance. But I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because, you know, in a lot of these places, the one organizing principle has been Islam. The one part of society that hasn't been controlled completely by the government. There are strains of extremism, and anti-Americanism, and anti-Western sentiment. And, you know, can be tapped into by demagogues. There will probably be some times where we bump up against some of these countries and have strong disagreements, but I do think that over the long term we are more likely to get a Middle East and North Africa that is more peaceful, more prosperous and more aligned with our interests. 
 
 The Romney campaign seized on those comments -- in an attempt to chip away at the president's approval rating on foreign affairs, which slid in the last NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll to 49 percent. 
 
 (However, a series of NBC/WSJ/Marist polls in the battleground states of Colorado, Iowa, and Wisconsin show Obama enjoying a double-digit lead over Romney when it comes to who would better handle foreign policy.) 
 
 NBC's Peter Alexander spoke with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Denver about the upcoming debates, world affairs, and if it is possible to change the tone in Washington. 
 
 The Obama White House fired back on Romney, arguing that it was ""offensive"" to suggest that the president was minimizing the deaths of four Americans in Libya, including the U.S. ambassador there. 
 
 ""That assertion is both desperate and offensive,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. ""The president was referring to the transformations in the region, to this process that has -- only began less than two years ago, as we saw in Tunisia, and continues to this day, with remarkable transformations occurring in countries around the region."" 
 
 Also in the interview, NBC's Alexander pressed Romney on the current polling that shows him trailing Obama. 
 
 Romney remained defiant. 
 
 ""I'm very pleased with the fact that we have a campaign that is taking our message to the people across America, and look --- we're gonna win,"" Romney said. ""There is no question in my mind. We're gonna win."" 
 
 NBC's Jordan Frasier contributed to this article.","– And now for something frothy on the campaign trail: President Obama is pretty certain he's ""eye candy,"" at least when it comes to the women on The View. But forget anything serious, ladies. He spent part of his appearance, scheduled to air today, holding hands with the First Lady, notes Politico. Obama shrugged off possible criticisms that he should be attending to international diplomacy with world leaders gathered for the annual opening of the UN General Assembly in New York instead of showing up on The View. ""I told folks I'm just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys,"" Obama quipped to the five female co-hosts. As the show was being taped, Hillary Clinton was in the city meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, notes the Times. But Obama, for the time being, was sticking to family issues, and talked about how Michelle can make him mad ""when she's being thoroughly unreasonable,"" he joked. Someone no doubt making him mad for real was Mitt Romney, who hammered Obama yesterday on the Mideast, particularly on his handling of the lethal attack on the US consulate in Libya earlier this month. ""These are not bumps in the road; these are human lives,” Romney said yesterday in Colorado, referring to the president's own words concerning problems in the region. “This is time for a president who will shape events in the Middle East."" White House press secretary Jay Carney called the attacks “desperate” and “offensive” attempts by Romney in a race he's losing. Carney might dismiss criticism over Libya, but questions linger.","<pad> – President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are a little more than a couple of hours late for a sit-down at the UN General Assembly, but they're still a couple of hours late.

 MONT-TREMBLANT, Que.--Richard Henry Bain left Montreal a couple of years ago to set up a fishing lodge in the mountains north of the city and dreams of expanding his business were apparently delayed by bureaucratic roadblocks. 
 
 Hours before gunshots rang out at a Parti Quebecois rally on Tuesday, Bain had been sent a note informing him that his request for an ice-fishing licence at his lodge had been put off. 
 
 Bain is known locally as the friendly Scottish guy who occasionally wears a kilt. He has had his picture in the paper standing next to Celine Dion. He's the generous neighbour who shares a freshly caught trout and drives passengers around in his military vehicle decorated with Mickey Mouse decals. 
 
 The locals are now shocked by news that has made international headlines. 
 
 Police sources confirmed they arrested a suspect by that name in the Montreal shooting that left one person dead and made headlines around the world. 
 
 The suspect in Tuesday's attack was wearing a housecoat and black facemask when he was tackled by police. He shouted about an awakening of English-speaking Quebecers as he was whisked away. 
 
 A hospital statement said Wednesday a man in police custody was undergoing an evaluation. Police said there could be charges laid in the case Thursday. 
 
 A Facebook page says a Richard Henry Bain runs a riverside lodge near Mont-Tremblant, Que. A website for the business was taken down Wednesday. 
 
 Bain, 62, was in constant contact with officials at the local municipality, La Conception, over the past several months as he tried to expand his business, according to the village manager. 
 
 He had applied to add licences for hunting and ice fishing at the lodge, Marie-France Brisson said in an interview. 
 
 The village received a copy of a letter addressed to Bain from a biologist conducting an environmental assessment. 
 
 It said the ice-fishing licence needed further study before being approved. 
 
 The village received its copy Tuesday -- hours before the shooting. Brisson said Bain may have received the letter the same day. 
 
 ""He was a man that was calm and polite who could also be frank,"" Brisson said. 
 
 ""He could sometimes be frustrated (with the bureaucratic process)."" 
 
 There is no evidence of any link between the man's business interests and the shooting. 
 
 Neighbours who live across the highway from the entrance to Bain's property couldn't believe the friendly, generous man they know as ""Rick"" or ""Scottish"" could be linked to such an incident. 
 
 Bain, who was occasionally seen wearing a kilt, would sometimes down beers with locals in the rural mountainous area close to the popular Mont-Tremblant park. 
 
 He wasn't all business, all the time. 
 
 A photo in a local newspaper from earlier this year shows Bain, dressed in a dapper black suit and white-collared shirt, standing alongside Celine Dion in Las Vegas. 
 
 The newspaper, Info du Nord Tremblant, said Bain and another man, David Bain, won VIP tickets at a local fundraising auction to see the singer last January. 
 
 Several people in the area said Bain started inviting anglers to fish for trout two years ago on the sweeping property in a dense forest. 
 
 His clients would park their vehicles on a grassy piece of land alongside the highway. Bain would drive them several kilometres up a bumpy trail into the backwoods aboard his three-axle military truck. 
 
 Bain's imposing army truck sat on the edge of the highway Wednesday, a couple of hundred metres from a locked gate leading to the property, which is on Crown land. 
 
 The olive-coloured truck catches the attention of passersby. It has Mickey Mouse decals on both doors to the cab. The image of Mickey features moose antlers instead of his trademark round mouse ears. 
 
 Neighbour Real Papineau said Bain was focused on attracting more business and asked him in the spring to hand out some pamphlets publicizing the fishing camp. 
 
 To return the favour, Papineau said Bain brought him a large brook trout as a thank you. 
 
 ""Incredible,"" he said, shaking his head in disbelief when a reporter told him that Bain's name was linked to the killing. 
 
 ""He was always in a good mood. I never heard him make any negative remarks."" 
 
 Marc-Andre Cyr, the owner of a campground near Bain's lodge, also said he was friendly and never showed any anger toward French-speaking Quebecers. 
 
 Cyr said they occasionally had a beer together. They always spoke French. 
 
 ""He's someone I would meet from time to time,"" he said. ""We never talked politics."" 
 
 He said he met Bain just over a year ago and that the man was new to the region. Bain joined the local chamber of commerce about a year ago. Police sources say he had relocated from Montreal. 
 
 Another man, Dominic Bouffard, who works for the local paper, said Bain is a successful businessman who occasionally took out ads to promote his lodge. Bouffard said he tried hard to network with local politicians and business leaders. 
 
 ""He did everything he could to meet people in the municipality, in the (Mont-Tremblant area), and everywhere,"" Bouffard said. 
 
 --with files from Benjamin Shingler and Julien Arsenault. ||||| A historic Quebec election that returned the Parti Québécois to power ended in tragedy Tuesday when a gunman killed one person and wounded another, then tried to start a fire at the Montreal venue where PQ Leader Pauline Marois was celebrating her minority mandate. 
 
 Police said a suspect entered a vestibule at the back of the Metropolis nightclub and fired shots, wounding two people critically. The suspect then started a fire and ran away on foot. 
 
 One shooting victim, a 45-year-old man, died at the scene. At a 6 a.m. press conference Wednesday, Montreal police said the second shooting victim, 27, was no longer in danger. Ambulance services reported another person is in hospital suffering from shock. 
 
 Montreal police spokesmen said they have arrested a 62-year-old man from Quebec, but not Montreal, who spoke French with an accent. The suspect has not been identified. Police have opened a homicide investigation and have seized two firearms. Sureté du Québec spokesman Guy Lapointe says police cannot rule out that Ms. Marois was the intended target. 
 
 “The English are waking up, the English are waking up ... It's payback ... Yeah, yeah, that’s enough,” the man said as police officers led him away in handcuffs. The suspect, a heavyset, bespectacled man, wore a balaclava, shorts and what appeared to be a bathrobe. 
 
 [Editor's note: Comments were originally open on this story. However we have now closed comments for legal reasons following the arrest of a man after people were shot and a fire was set outside the PQ victory celebration. Readers can still access comments posted earlier by clicking here.] 
 
 Ms. Marois was in the middle of her victory speech, after narrowly defeating Jean Charest’s Liberals by a handful of seats and about one percentage point in the popular vote, when several plainclothes police officers from her security detail suddenly burst on stage and pulled her away, shouting ""Go with us, madam!"" She later returned and spoke to the crowd. 
 
 Earlier, Ms. Marois had acknowledged the ambivalence of Quebec voters in giving her a narrow minority mandate. 
 
 ""We will respect that choice by governing with all the other elected lawmakers. We'll make the necessary compromises to make the state work ... We'll govern in a responsible way."" 
 
 Ms. Marois, who had been severely criticized for campaigning on identity and language themes, had some conciliatory words for Quebec's anglophone and native communities, speaking of their shared history and, in a rare move for her, speaking in English to say their rights would be respected. 
 
 However, she struck a tougher stance towards the rest of Canada. 
 
 ""As a nation, we want to take ourselves the decisions that affect us. We want a country. And we'll have it."" 
 
 Liberal Leader Jean Charest, the outgoing premier, lost in his riding, for the first time in a 28-year career that began when he was elected to Parliament on this day in 1984. 
 
 ""The results of this election speaks to the fact the future of Quebec lies within Canada,"" he said. He also quipped that, ""I want to thank the activists of the Liberal party who once again proved the polls wrong."" 
 
 In his concession speech, Mr. Charest boasted that his party ""will leave the house in good order."" 
 
 Mr. Charest predicted that the Liberals would bounce back. Pointing an index up, he noted that there was ""one percentage point in the popular vote between us (and the PQ)."" 
 
 He made no comments about his political future. A press conference is scheduled for Wednesday. 
 
 In a statement issued early Wednesday by Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s office, he said: “We are disturbed by this violence and our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.” 
 
 Earlier, Mr. Harper congratulated Ms. Marois — then delivered a pointed barb aimed at the independence project. “We don’t believe Quebeckers want to reopen the old constitutional quarrels of the past,” he said in a statement. 
 
 “Our government will remain focused on jobs, economic growth and good economic management. We believe economic issues and jobs are also the priority of Quebeckers. In that sense, we will continue working with the Government of Quebec on those common objectives.” 
 
 Report Typo/Error","– A historic victory for the separatist Parti Quebecois was marred by an attack on a victory rally for premier-elect Pauline Marois. A man opened fire during her victory speech, killing one person and critically wounding another, reports CTV. The suspect, a man in his 50s, then started a fire and ran away. He was pursued by firefighters and held until police arrived. Witnesses reported hearing the man say—in French—""That's enough"" and ""The Anglos are waking up,"" the Globe and Mail reports.

 20 cars that rack up tickets The highest percentage of recently-ticketed drivers operate a Lexus ES300, according to a 2016 survey by Insurance.com, the car insurance comparison-shopping website. The stylish Lexus sedan sits at the top of this year’s list of cars with the most tickets. In a previous Insurance.com study, conducted in 2014, the Subaru WRX ranked as the highest “ticket magnet,” but that make and model dropped to number 12 in the most recent data analysis. Insurance.com reviewed insurance claim and traffic violation data from 331 models and more than 323,000 recent customers. While the most frequently ticketed vehicles include a variety of economy and luxury cars, the cars with the lowest percentage of tickets are generally more expensive vehicles, such as the Buick Encore (3%), Lexus IS350 (3%), Acura ILX (6%) and Cadillac ATS (6%). “It’s the driver that gets tickets, not the car,” says Penny Gusner, consumer analyst for Insurance.com. “But it is interesting to see what vehicle makes and models attract drivers who are prone to traffic violations.” 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 1 #1. Lexus ES 300 – 33% This popular Lexus was manufactured between 1992 and 2003. As an older model, it is possible that current drivers may have purchased a used vehicle at a great value, or that younger drivers could be operating a family sedan that was passed down to them. Drivers in this study were surveyed between February 2014 and February 2016. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 2 #2. Nissan 350Z--33% This sports car was introduced in 2003, and it had a good run until 2009 when the 370Z replaced it. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 3 #3. Dodge Charger SE/SXT--32% While Dodge Chargers have been built for many years, beginning in 1966, the SE was introduced much later: in 2006. These sedans continue to be manufactured today. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 4 #4. Volkswagen Jetta GL – 31% First produced for the 1980 model year, this affordable car offers drivers the choice between a manual or automatic transmission. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 5 #5. Chevrolet Monte Carlo LS/LT – 31% While the first Monte Carlo appeared in 1970, the LS model was introduced nearly 30 years later, in 1998. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 6 #6. Mazda 3S – 30% This attractive car was introduced in 2003, for the 2004 model year. A third generation Mazda 3S was unveiled in 2013, for the 2014 model year. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 7 #7. Volkswagen GTI – 30% This vehicle helped popularize the ""hatch back"" feature that endured for more than a decade. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 8 #8. Dodge Stratus SXT – 30% This mid-size sedan replaced the Dodge Spirit in the mid-1990s. From 2001 through 2006, Chrysler employed a ""cab forward"" design which provided more room in the trunk and interior. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 9 #9. Acura 3.0s – 30% This option-rich sedan model has been on the road since 1998. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: No. 10 #10. Toyota Tacoma – 30% This powerful and reliable truck was available beginning in 1995 and the Tacoma model continues to sell today. 
 
 Cars with the most tickets: 11-20 The next set of cars whose drivers got the most tickets comprises this list of vehicles in spots 11-20: 11. Mazda Tribute – 30% 
 
 12. Subaru Impreza WRX – 30% 
 
 13. Lexus LS 400 Series – 30% 
 
 14. Subaru Impreza 2.5I – 30% 
 
 15. Mercedes-Benz C300 4 Matic – 30% 
 
 16. Chevrolet Malibu 2LT – 29% 
 
 17. Lincoln LS – 29% 
 
 18. Ford Fusion S – 29% 
 
 19. Mazda 3I – 29% 
 
 20. Chevrolet Tahoe K1500 – 29% Insurance companies often pay more attention to claims than they do to traffic tickets when setting rates. Car models with high insurance claim rates can result in higher premiums for everyone owning those vehicles. Violation tickets drive up the individual coverage costs for the person who receives a citation. “It’s notable that cars on most tickets list also appear to have an above-average number of insurance claims,” says Gusner. Twenty-three percent of surveyed drivers at the top of Insurance.com’s ticket list filed an insurance claim during the survey period, while only 19 percent of all other cars made insurance claims within that timeframe. ||||| This week, Hollywood mega star Chris Pratt reminisced to Ellen DeGeneres about his days as a broke actor living in a van on the streets of Maui. A $700 part in a low-budget horror movie was his lucky break, Pratt shared, revealing that he lived off the paycheck for a full year! The 35-year-old Jurassic World star hardly needs to budget like that these days.

 Weirdly, Pratt’s not alone. Hollywood history is filled with stories of down-and-out entertainers waiting for luck to strike. Here are eight more celebrities who lived in their cars before their big breaks.

 The ""Heartbeat Song"" singer is now reportedly worth an estimated $29 million, but she grew up poor in a small town in Texas. After high school graduation, Clarkson went to Los Angeles to shop around her demo tape. When her apartment building burned down, the singer, now 32, lived briefly in her car before giving up and slinking back to Texas. Her life changed when she heard about an audition for a new singing competition reality TV show called American Idol in 2002.

 There’s a reason two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank gravitates toward underdog roles. Swank, now 40, grew up in a trailer park in Washington. After her father left the family, teenage Swank and her mother Judy took off for Los Angeles, living out of an Oldsmobile so Swank could audition for parts. After a few early breaks, Swank landed the role of murdered transgender teen Brandon Teena in the film Boys Don’t Cry, for which she won her first Oscar. ""My background is not something I forget,"" Swank has said. ""It helps me to not take what I have for granted.""

 Before he was the star of The Drew Carey Show and the host of The Price Is Right, Carey, 56, was just a comedian in Cleveland trying to get booked on The Tonight Show, whose host Johnny Carson was known for making comedians’ careers. Carey headed west to Los Angeles where he lived in his car for a year and a half until he got the call from producers. The set went well: Carson laughed like crazy, invited Carey over to the couch to chat, and the rest is history.

 Just before wowing audiences in Avatar and Clash of the Titans, the Australian star was unemployed and out of work. ""Sold everything I owned and was just living in the car basically, not doing much,"" he told an interviewer. An audition with director James Cameron changed his life, and Worthington, 38, ditched the car for proper digs. The actor, who has a newborn son with Aussie model Lara Bingle last month listed his Hawaiian mansion for sale. The price? $6.5 million.

 Sure, she’s sold 27 million albums worldwide, but the folky singer and reality show judge, who scored a huge hit with 1995’s ""Who Will Save Your Soul?,"" grew up in a house in Alaska without plumbing. At age 18, the singer lived in her car for a year, driving from city to city to play gigs before landing a record deal. ""Money will not make you happy, but it takes away a lot of stress,"" she’s said. ""To this day, the things I love the most are having a place to live, never worrying about my electrical bills, being able to buy the groceries I want to buy, and being able to pay the doctors.""

 Actor and director Perry is a Hollywood empire unto himself, but life wasn’t always so easy. Perry, now 45, spent every penny he had trying to stage his landmark musical I Know I’ve Been Changed, which forced him to be homeless for six years, some of which Perry spent living in his car. 
 
 ""Can you imagine a six-foot-five man sleeping in a Geo Metro?"" he told Essence magazine.

 Her financial house is in order now (and she’d like yours to be, too!), but even money guru Orman had a rough beginning. On her personal website, Orman, now 63, recalls dropping out of college and borrowing money from her brother to buy a Ford Econoline van, which she and friends lived in as they drove across the country. After years of waiting tables, Orman’s life changed when a friendly customer took pity on the broke young woman and handed her a check for $2,000 with instructions on how to invest it.

 The television personality and author is on top of the world these days, but Harvey, now 58, remembers the three years he spent homeless when he was trying to crack the comedy circuit in the late 1980s. Money dried up. ""I had nowhere to go,"" Harvey told People, so he began living in his 1976 Ford Tempo, using an Igloo cooler as a refrigerator. “It was rock bottom,” he recalled. ""But even in my darkest days I had faith it would turn around."" A call to appear on Showtime at the Apollo was his lucky break.

 A statement from the body, the Investigative Committee, didn't address the possibility seen as likely by many of Nemtsov's supporters — that he was killed for being one of President Vladimir Putin's most adamant and visible critics. 
 
 The 55-year-old Nemtsov was gunned down Friday near midnight as he walked on a bridge near the Kremlin with a female companion. The killing came just a few hours after a radio interview in which he denounced Putin's ""mad, aggressive"" policies and the day before he was to help lead a rally protesting Russia's actions in the Ukraine crisis and the economic crisis at home. 
 
 After his death, organizers canceled the rally and instead called for a demonstration to mourn him on Sunday in central Moscow. The city gave quick approval for that gathering, in contrast to its usual slow and grudging permission for opposition rallies. 
 
 The Investigative Committee said it was looking into whether Nemtsov had been killed as a ""sacrificial victim for those who do not shun any method for achieving their political goals,"" a suggestion echoing the comments by Putin's spokesman and other Russian politicians that the attack was a ""provocation"" against the state. 
 
 It also said it was considering whether there was ""personal enmity"" toward him in his domestic life. State-controlled TV and Kremlin-friendly media outlets on Saturday gave considerable attention to Nemtsov's companion, identifying her as a Ukrainian model 30 years his junior and showing photos of her in alluring poses. The Investigative Committee said the pair were headed for Nemtsov's apartment. 
 
 The statement also said it was investigating whether the killing was connected to the Ukraine conflict, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since last April, or whether there was a connection to Islamic extremism. 
 
 Nemtsov had been one of Putin's most visible critics and his death hit other members of the opposition hard. The mourning march on Sunday could serve to galvanize the beleaguered and marginalized opposition, or it could prove to be a brief catharsis after which emotions dissipate. 
 
 Through the morning, hundreds of people came to the site of Nemtsov's death to lay flowers. 
 
 Nemtsov was working on a report presenting evidence that he believed proved Russia's direct involvement in the separatist rebellion that has raged in eastern Ukraine since April. Moscow denies backing the rebels with troops and sophisticated weapons. 
 
 Putin ordered Russia's top law enforcement chiefs to personally oversee the investigation of Nemtsov's killing. 
 
 ""Putin noted that this cruel murder has all the makings of a contract hit and is extremely provocative,"" presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies. 
 
 Ramzan Kadyrov, the Putin-backed leader of Chechnya, raised the suggestion into an accusation. 
 
 ""There's no doubt that Nemtsov's killing was organized by Western special services, trying by any means to create internal conflict in Russia,"" he said on Instagram. 
 
 President Barack Obama said the Russian people ""lost one of the most dedicated and eloquent defenders of their rights."" 
 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Nemtsov's courage in criticizing Kremlin policies, and urged Putin to insure that the killers are brought to justice, her spokesman Steffen Seibert said. 
 
 Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev echoed the suggestion that the killing was a provocation. ""It's an attempt to push the situation into complications, maybe even to destabilizing the situation in the country,"" he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. 
 
 Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov agreed. ""It's a provocation; for big fires, sacrificial figures are necessary,"" Interfax quoted him as saying. 
 
 Nemtsov frequently assailed the government's inefficiency, rampant corruption and Ukraine policy. 
 
 In an interview with the Sobesednik newspaper, Nemtsov said earlier this month that his 86-year old mother was afraid that Putin could have him killed. Asked if he had such fears himself, he responded: ""If I were afraid I wouldn't have led an opposition party."" 
 
 Speaking on radio just a few hours before his death, he accused Putin of plunging Russia into crisis by his ""mad, aggressive and deadly policy of war against Ukraine."" 
 
 Kasyanov, the former prime minister, said he was shocked. 
 
 ""In the 21st century, a leader of the opposition is being demonstratively shot just outside the walls of the Kremlin!"". 
 
 ""This is a monstrous tragedy and a loss for us all,"" Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure, said on his Facebook page. He is currently on a 15-day jail sentence for handing out leaflets without authorization. 
 
 ""The country is rolling into the abyss,"" Kasyanov, the former prime minister, told reporters as Nemtsov's body, placed in a plastic bag, was removed on a rainy and cold night, as the Kremlin bells chimed nearby. 
 
 Nemtsov served as a regional governor and then a deputy prime minister in the 1990s and once was seen as a possible successor to Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first elected president. 
 
 Nemtsov was widely liked for his good humor, larger-than-life character and quick wit, but he and other top opposition figures long have been purged from state television and steadily marginalized by the Kremlin.

 Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov and Laura Mills in Moscow and Jake Pearson in New York contributed to this report. ||||| “I love Russia and want the best for her, so for me criticizing Putin is a very patriotic activity because these people are leading Russia to ruin,” Mr. Nemtsov said in an interview in 2011, republished Saturday on the Meduza news site. “Everybody who supports them in fact supports a regime that is destroying the country, and so they are the ones who hate Russia. And those who criticize this regime, those who fight against it, they are the patriots.” 
 
 In recent years, Mr. Nemtsov’s star had been eclipsed by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who played a leading role in the 2011 protests. But Mr. Nemtsov remained active and was a leading organizer of this weekend’s planned rally. 
 
 Mr. Nemtsov was organizing the rally in part because Mr. Navalny is currently serving a two-week jail sentence for handing out leaflets on the subway. The rally was also noteworthy because it was the first political action inside Russia specifically endorsed by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the exiled former political prisoner, who had signed the petition for a parade permit. 
 
 The investigative committee of the prosecutor’s office said gunmen shot Mr. Nemtsov four times in the back as he walked over the bridge, and by accident or design theatrically placed his body on the wet asphalt with the Kremlin visible behind. No suspects have been reported to be in custody. 
 
 While such contract street killings were commonplace in Moscow in the 1990s, the violence had dwindled under Mr. Putin, making the killing of Mr. Nemtsov all the more shocking. He is by far the most prominent public figure to die in such a fashion, though just one in a string of murders of opponents of Mr. Putin, most notoriously the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the human rights researcher Natalia Estemirova and the security service defector Aleksandr V. Litvinenko. And while low-level criminals have been detained in some cases, the investigations in Russia never traced back to those who ordered the murders. 
 
 The Interfax news agency cited an unnamed security service operative as saying the murder was a “provocation,” coming as it did just days before the opposition march. ||||| Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko addresses the commemoration for people from the so-called ''Heavenly Sotnya'' (Hundred), who were killed in anti-government protests in 2014, at Independence Square in Kiev February 20, 2015.

 KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Saturday Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was murdered because he planned to disclose evidence of Russia's involvement in Ukraine's separatist conflict. 
 
 Poroshenko paid tribute to Nemtsov, who was shot dead late on Friday, and said the fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin had told him a couple of weeks ago that he had proof of Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis and would reveal it. 
 
 ""He said he would reveal persuasive evidence of the involvement of Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Someone was very afraid of this ... They killed him,"" Poroshenko said in televised comments during a visit to the city of Vinnytsia. 
 
 More than 5,600 people have been killed since pro-Russian separatists rebelled in east Ukraine last April, after the ousting of a Moscow-backed president in Kiev and Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula. 
 
 Kiev and its Western allies say the rebels are funded and armed by Moscow, and backed by Russian military units. Moscow denies aiding sympathisers in Ukraine, and says heavily armed Russian-speaking troops operating without insignia there are not its men.

""He said he would reveal persuasive evidence of the involvement of Russian armed forces in Ukraine,"" says Poroshenko. ""Someone was very afraid of this. ... They killed him."" Russian investigators, meanwhile, said they were looking at a range of motives, including the idea that enemies of Putin killed Nemtsov ""as a provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country,"" reports the New York Times. They also made a point to say they would look into his personal life, and state TV emphasized that the 55-year-old was walking with a much younger model when he was shot to death, reports AP. Putin himself sent a message to Nemtsov's mother promising that ""everything will be done so that the organizers and perpetrators of a vile and cynical murder get the punishment they deserve.” It did not mention that in a recent interview, Nemtsov talked about how his mother was ""truly scared"" that Putin would have him killed because of his unrelenting criticism of the Kremlin.

42,"A wonky beast about the size of a Labrador retriever with a long neck and lengthy tail may be the world's earliest known dinosaur, say researchers who analyzed fossilized bones discovered in Tanzania in the 1930s. 
 
 Now named Nyasasaurus parringtoni, the dinosaur would've walked a different Earth from today. It lived between 240 million and 245 million years ago when the planet's continents were still stitched together to form the landmass Pangaea. Tanzania would've been part of the southern end of Pangaea that also included Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. 
 
 It likely stood upright, measuring 7 to 10 feet (2 to 3 meters) in length, 3 feet (1 m) at the hip, and may have weighed between 45 and 135 pounds (20 to 60 kilograms). 
 
 ""If the newly named Nyasasaurus parringtoni is not the earliest dinosaur, then it is the closest relative found so far,"" said lead researcher Sterling Nesbitt, a postdoctoral biology researcher at the University of Washington. 
 
 The findings, detailed online Dec. 5 in the journal Biology Letters, push the dinosaur lineage back 10 million to 15 million years than previously known, all the way into the Middle Triassic, which lasted from about 245 million to 228 million years ago. [See Photos of the Oldest Dinosaur Fossils] 
 
 Dating a dinosaur 
 
 The study is based on seemingly few bones — a humerus or upper arm bone and six vertebrae — though Nesbitt pointed out much of what we know about dinosaurs comes from similar number of fossils. Only a rare few dinosaurs are excavated with near-complete skeletons, a la museum centerpieces. 
 
 For their study, the researchers had to determine whether the bones indeed belonged to a dinosaur and how long ago the beast would've lived. 
 
 They dated the fossils based on the layer of rock in which it was found and the ages for the layers above and below it (over time layers of sediment accumulate on top of remains, making a vertical slice somewhat of a timeline into the past). 
 
 They also looked at the ages of rock layers with similar animal remains found across the globe. 
 
 As for whether the beast is a dinosaur, several clues say it is. For instance, dinosaurs grew quickly, and a cross-section of the humerus suggests bone tissue was laid down in a haphazard way, a telltale sign of rapid growth. 
 
 ""We can tell from the bone tissues that Nyasasaurus had a lot of bone cells and blood vessels,"" said co-author Sarah Werning of the University of California, Berkeley, who did the bone analysis. ""In living animals, we only see this many bone cells and blood vessels in animals that grow quickly, like some mammals or birds,"" Werning said in a statement. 
 
 The patterns in this bone scan indicate that the bone fibers are disorganized, like those of other early dinosaurs. Credit: ©Natural History Museum 
 
 The upper arm bone also sported a distinctively enlarged crest that would've served as a place of attachment for arm muscles. 
 
 ""It's kind of your shoulder muscle or the equivalent in a dinosaur,"" Nesbitt told LiveScience, adding that ""early dinosaurs are the only group to have this feature."" 
 
 Vertebrate paleontologist and geologist Hans-Dieter Sues, who was not involved in the study, agrees with the dating and dinosaur tag placed on the remains. ""I first saw the bones in the 1970s when the late Alan Charig (one of the co-authors) showed them to me,"" Sues, of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., told LiveScience in an email. At that time none of his colleagues would accept that dinosaurs had appeared so early in geological history."" 
 
 Sues added that additional, more complete remains are needed to confirm the relationships between Nyasasaurus and other dinosaurs. [6 Weird Species Discovered in Museums] 
 
 Answering a long-standing question 
 
 Paleontologists have for about 150 years suggested dinosaurs existed in the Middle Triassic, as the oldest dinosaur fossils fit into the Late Triassic period. However, that evidence has been fraught with uncertainty, with conclusions based on only dinosaurlike footprints or very fragmentary fossils. Footprints can be tricky to interpret, in this case, because other animals roaming Earth at the time would've made similar pedal prints. 
 
 ""Previous to this find, all the oldest dinosaurs were all equally old from the same place in Argentina, and those sediments are about 230 million years [old]. So this pushes the dinosaur lineage or the closest relative to dinosaurs all the way back to the Middle Triassic,"" Nesbitt said during a telephone interview. ""This is our best evidence of a Middle Triassic dinosaur."" 
 
 In addition to pushing back the timeline for dinosaurs, Nesbitt says the study also reveals how dinosaurs emerged on Earth. Rather than waking up on the planet as the dominant beasts during their heydays in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, dinosaurs gradually ramped up to their reign. 
 
 ""They were a unique group, but they didn't evolve and take over terrestrial ecosystems immediately,"" Nesbitt said. ""Most of what we see in museums are from the Jurassic and Cretaceous when they did dominate — at their origins they were just a part of the radiation of Archosaurs,"" or the dominant land animals during the Triassic period that included dinosaurs, crocodiles and their relatives. 
 
 Nesbitt hopes the discovery will encourage other paleontologists digging in Middle Triassic rocks to keep a lookout for dinosaurs — fossils, that is.

 Palaeontologists have found what is likely to be the oldest known dinosaur, filling in a yawning evolutionary gap. 
 
 A study in Biology Letters describes Nyasasaurus parringtoni, a new species from 10-15 million years before the previous earliest dinosaur specimens. 
 
 It walked on two legs, measured 2-3m in length with a large tail and weighed between 20 and 60kg. 
 
 The find suggests that many millions of years passed between dinosaurs' first members and their dominance on land. 
 
 ""It fills a gap between what we previously knew to be the oldest dinosaurs and their other closest relatives,"" report co-author Paul Barrett, of the Natural History Museum in London, told BBC News. 
 
 Image caption The find shores up the idea that dinosaurs evolved on the southern parts of the supercontinent Pangaea 
 
 ""There was this big gap in the fossil record where dinosaurs should've been present and this fossil neatly fills that gap."" 
 
 However, the team behind the work has stopped short of definitively calling N parringtoni the earliest dinosaur, because the fossil skeletons used to define it were incomplete: one upper arm bone and six vertebrae. 
 
 The early evolution of dinosaurs is difficult to unpick, as a rich variety of reptiles were proliferating at the time - and some may even have independently evolved characteristics that are associated with dinosaurs. 
 
 The researchers, from the University of Washington and University of California Berkeley in the US and the Natural History Museum, re-examined a number of bones that were first collected from what is now Lake Malawi in southern Africa. 
 
 They saw a few features that are unambiguously those of dinosaurs - notably what is called an ""elongated deltopectoral crest"" that served as an anchor for strong pectoral muscles. 
 
 Lead author of the research Sterling Nesbitt, of the University of Washington Seattle, led a team that in 2010 reported the finding of dinosaurs' oldest relative, a member of a group called the silesaurs. 
 
 It now appears that those creatures shared the southern part of the supercontinent Pangaea - now South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia - with N parringtoni. 
 
 ""Those animals were the earliest of this group that led up toward dinosaurs,"" explained Dr Barrett. ""Now this takes dinosaurs back to the right kind of time when those two groups would have split apart from each other."" 
 
 As it closes that evolutionary gap, it shows that dinosaurs did not start out as dominant as they later became. 
 
 ""We push the origin of dinosaurs further back in time to a time when lots of reptile groups are evolving,"" Dr Barrett said. 
 
 ""Dinosaurs start out as a very insignificant group of reptiles - all relatively small animals, relatively rare in comparison with other reptile groups - and it's only a bit later in their history that they suddenly explode and take over as the dominant forms of life for nearly 100 million years.""","– Scientists studying fossilized bones originally discovered in Tanzania in the 1930s may have revealed Earth's oldest known dinosaur, LiveScience reports. Nyasasaurus parringtoni lived between 240 million and 245 million years ago, some 10 million to 15 million years earlier than any other dinosaurs previously discovered. Researchers stopped short of calling the Nyasasaurus the earliest dinosaur, because just six vertebrae and an upper arm bone are available to study, but numerous clues indicate the beast is, in fact, a dinosaur. ""There was this big gap in the fossil record where dinosaurs should've been present and this fossil neatly fills that gap,"" the study co-author tells the BBC. Paleontologists have long believed dinosaurs existed in the Middle Triassic period, the era from which this fossil dates. If it is indeed a dinosaur, this fossil shows that dinosaurs started out ""as a very insignificant group of reptiles"" before exploding into the dominant life form on Earth millions of years later, the co-author says.

 German Nazi-era art hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, who died on Tuesday, has made the Bern Art Museum in Switzerland his ""sole heir"". 
 
 The reclusive son of Adolf Hitler's art dealer is estimated to have amassed a collection worth up to a billion euros. 
 
 The museum said the news struck ""like a bolt from the blue"", given that it had had no relationship with Mr Gurlitt. 
 
 The collection was the subject of a long legal dispute over works that may have been taken illegally by the Nazis. 
 
 Analysis The Bern Art Museum now gets ownership of the collection but lawyers for Cornelius Gurlitt indicated that paintings shown to be looted would be returned to the present-day heirs of the victims, an arrangement which still stands. There is no argument over works which were acquired by Mr Gurlitt's father before the Nazis came to power so they can go to Bern. But in between the two categories are hundreds of paintings which may be disputed. The authorities will give potential claimants a year to come forward. At the end of it all, the name Gurlitt may be remembered in some title like the Gurlitt Bequest at the museum in Bern. It would be a bland title belying a tragic human story. 
 
 The Bern Art Museum said that it was delighted at the news that it had been made Mr Gurlitt's ""unrestricted and unfettered sole heir"", but added that the bequest also posed some questions. 
 
 ""The Board of Trustees and directors of Kunstmuseum Bern are surprised and delighted, but at the same time do not wish to conceal the fact that this magnificent bequest brings with it a considerable burden of responsibility and a wealth of questions of the most difficult and sensitive kind, and questions in particular of a legal and ethical nature"", it said in a statement. 
 
 Mr Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was ordered to deal in works that had been seized from Jews, or which the Nazis considered ""degenerate"" and had removed from German museums. 
 
 The priceless collection was confiscated in 2012 by Bavarian authorities from the apartment of his son.

 After initially refusing to give up the paintings, Mr Gurlitt changed his position, agreeing to co-operate with the German authorities on establishing the paintings' provenance, and returning them if they were shown to be stolen. 
 
 'Wild speculation' 
 
 Mr Gurlitt, who had no close relatives, wrote the will within the last few weeks shortly before undergoing heart surgery, according to his spokesman, Stephan Holzinger. 
 
 ""It now falls to the probate court to determine if the will is valid and whether a contract of inheritance exists,"" he told the BBC earlier on Wednesday. 
 
 ""I can understand that there is now wild speculation, but I don't want to comment on that at this stage.""

 The German government said earlier that the collector's death would not affect the investigation into ownerships claims on the paintings. 
 
 Mr Gurlitt's collection only came to light after a routine check found he was carrying wads of cash on a train from Switzerland, triggering a tax inquiry. 
 
 Investigators found more than 1,400 works in his flat in Munich in February 2012 - though they only revealed the discovery in late 2013 - and a further 60 in his house near Salzburg, Austria, earlier this year. 
 
 Among them were works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Emil Nolde and Max Liebermann. 
 
 The collection is estimated to be worth up to a billion euros (£850m; $1.35bn). 
 
 Under German law, Cornelius Gurlitt was not compelled to return any paintings because the incidents happened more than 30 years ago. ||||| Several works in his collection suspected of having been looted from Jewish families during Nazi era 
 
 A Swiss museum has inherited one of the most controversial art collections in recent European history. Kunstmuseum Bern confirmed on Wednesday it has been named the ""unrestricted and unfettered sole heir"" in the will of the reclusive collector Cornelius Gurlitt, who died on Tuesday. 
 
 Several works in the collection, which was originally assembled by Gurlitt's father Hildebrand, are suspected of having been looted from Jewish families during the Nazi era. A taskforce of art experts is examining the provenance of the works in a secret location in Germany until the end of the year. 
 
 Kunstmuseum Bern's director, Matthias Frehner, said in a statement: that the news had come ""like a bolt from the blue"", since Gurlitt had at no time had any connection to the museum. Already boasting works by Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee, the museum could soon be showing paintings and sketches by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Marc Chagall, Oskar Kokoschka and Max Liebermann among others. 
 
 Frehner said: ""The Board of Trustees and Directors of Kunstmuseum Bern are surprised and delighted, but at the same time do not wish to conceal the fact that this magnificent bequest brings with it a considerable burden of responsibility and a wealth of questions of the most difficult and sensitive kind, and questions in particular of a legal and ethical nature."" 
 
 Chris Marinello, a London-based art recovery expert representing the descendants of the Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg, welcomed the news: ""We see it as a positive development that Mr Gurlitt left his collection to a museum, which is bound by international codes of ethics regarding looted artworks as well as the Washington principles on Nazi-confiscated art"". 
 
 Given that one painting in Gurlitt's possession, Henri Matisse's Sitting Woman, had already been proven to be looted from Rosenberg's collection, Marinello didn't expect it to end up in Bern, he told the Guardian. ||||| MUNICH, Germany – Reclusive art collector Cornelius Gurlitt left his entire trove of works concealed for decades to the Kuntsmuseum in Bern, Switzerland, the museum said Wednesday. 
 
 Gurlitt, who died on Tuesday, hoarded more than 1,000 works believed to be lost in World War II or destroyed by the Nazi regime in his apartment and in a house outside Salzburg, Austria. The collection, which was amassed by Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, includes paintings and drawings by Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. 
 
 German tax authorities discovered the pieces in February 2012 in Gurlitt's apartment. 
 
 Gurlitt's lawyer Christoph Edel confirmed by telephone and in writing that Gurlitt had ""appointed the private-law foundation Kuntsmuseum Bern his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir,"" the museum said in a statement. 
 
 The news ""came like a bolt from the blue, since at no time has Mr. Gurlitt had any connection with Kuntsmuseum Bern,"" it said. 
 
 The Nazis had labeled the avant-garde artworks as “degenerate” and plundered them from museums or forced owners, many of them Jewish, to sell them for below their real prices. Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer close to the Nazi regime, built up the collection that today rivals those of many of the world’s modern art museums. 
 
 His son then concealed them for decades. 
 
 CHRISTOF STACHE / AFP - Getty Images A picture shows the building in Munich's Schwabing district where hundreds of masterpieces thought to have been stolen by the Nazis were discovered in an apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt. 
 
 “[Cornelius Gurlitt's] heirs can decide how to proceed with the art work, but they will have to abide by the agreement that was reached,” Edel told NBC News earlier on Wednesday. 
 
 He was referring to a deal struck with government last month that established a task force to research the provenance of works suspected of having been stolen by the Nazis. A website has been set up for potential claimants to see the collection. 
 
 ""[Gurlitt] is committed to the voluntary return of any looted art,"" German Culture Minister Monika Grütters said at the time. 
 
 The find of nearly 1,300 paintings and drawings last fall delighted the art world, but also brought doubt about the rightful ownership and restitution claims. 
 
 Matthias Henkel, director of communications for the task force appointed by the government, told NBC News that the experts were continuing in their fact-finding mission and acting on the assumption that whoever inherited the art would abide by the agreement. 
 
 “We also have a moral obligation to clarify the historical circumstances,” he said. 
 
 German media had reported earlier that Gurlitt wanted to pass the ownership of the artworks to “a foreign institution.” 
 
 He reportedly was upset with German authorities over the investigation and had contacts with art institutions in Austria and Switzerland, home to the Kuntsmuseum Bern.

The museum said the news struck ""like a bolt from the blue""—especially since it had no relationship with Gurlitt—but the ""magnificent bequest"" comes with ""a considerable burden and a wealth of questions."" Gurlitt had already agreed that paintings known to be looted must go to the victims' present-day heirs; other works, acquired before the Nazis took power, can stay with the museum. ""But in between the two categories are hundreds of paintings which may be disputed,"" writes Stephen Evans in a BBC analysis. A website has been created for claimants to see the art collection, NBC News reports, and an art recovery expert representing claimants in the case says he likes Gurlitt's will—because, he tells the Guardian, ""the museum is bound by international codes of ethics regarding looted artworks as well as the Washington principles on Nazi-confiscated art.""","<pad> Cornelius Gurlitt, who died in Munich, has made the Bern Art Museum his ""sole heir""</s>",0.12578616171195764,0.03809523676870753,0.12578616171195764

 Updated 8:21 a.m.: In the death investigation of David M. Brockie, detectives with Richmond police say they ""do not suspect foul play at this time,"" department spokeswoman Dionne Waugh tells Style. 
 
 Police were called to Brockie's residence in the 4800 block of West Seminary Avenue at approximately 6:53 p.m. on Sunday, she says, and found Brockie deceased when they arrived. The Medical Examiner's office will determine the cause of death. 
 
 The founder and lead singer of renowned metal band Gwar, David Brockie, has died, numerous sources close to the band tell 
 
 A member of the Richmond Police Department confirmed early Monday that the 50-year-old musician was found dead in his home Sunday between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. by his roommate. 
 
 ""Dave was one of the funniest, smartest, most creative and energetic persons I've known,"" former Gwar bassist Mike Bishop says. ""He was brash sometimes, always crass, irreverent, he was hilarious in every way. But he was also deeply intelligent and interested in life, history, politics and art."" 
 
 ""His penchant for scatological humors belied a lucid wit. He was a criminally underrated lyricist and hard rock vocalist, one of the best, ever! A great front man, a great painter, writer, he was also a hell of a bass guitarist. I loved him. He was capable of great empathy and had a real sense of justice."" 
 
 The news comes in a year the Grammy-nominated band marks its 30th anniversary and recently returned from a long-awaited first performance in Japan. It recently announced that it would hold its fifth Gwar-B-Q concert Aug. 16 at Hadad’s Water Park. 
 
 Brockie, aka Oderus Urungus, founded what became Richmond's most famous band in 1984 with a group of five boundary-pushing artists and musicians working out of North Side's Richmond Dairy. The band struck a nerve, selling out shows and touring the globe. It released its 13th album in 2013. 
 
 The self-described ""Scumdogs of the Universe"" were known for their messy shows, outlandish costumes and intentionally offensive theatrics. ""We were and still are provocateurs,"" Brockie told Style in a 2012 feature story. ""We're just a bunch of guys with warped senses of humor spit balling the most evil ideas that we could think of, to hold up a twisted mirror to the culture."" 
 
 Friends and others posted condolences and remembrances across Facebook into Monday morning. ""I wish it was a joke,"" says former band member Chris Bopst, a music writer for Style. ""Everyone is in shock."" 
 
 We'll report more details as they become available and share the band's official statement here. 
 
 Brockie, a devoted fan of the Washington Redskins and a World War II buff, had recently fulfilled two of his lifelong dreams by visiting Stalingrad and playing shows in Japan with Gwar. 
 
 While the singer's death will be mourned internationally by the metal community, his passing will hit even harder here at home among friends and family. It would seem to mark the end of an era in Richmond and this city will be a different place without him. 
 
 Brockie made numerous appearances in character commenting on current events and culture, including such unexpected places as ""Red Eye"" on Fox News. In an interview last month on Insane Clown Posse Theater, Oderus Urungus talked about the essence of what made him tick: ||||| GWAR Frontman Dave Brockie Found Dead at 50

45,"It's time once again for an absurd Thanksgiving ritual. 
 
 On Wednesday, the National Turkey Foundation will carry two plump male turkeys over to the White House and lift them onto a table. President Obama will give them goofy names like Caramel and Popcorn. Then Obama will ""pardon"" the turkeys and, instead of lopping off their heads and tossing them in an oven, he will let them live out the rest of their lives at the estate in Mount Vernon. 
 
 To be fair, the president has to do lots of frivolous public events like this one every year. But the turkey pardon stands out as being especially dumb and worth abolishing. Here's why: 
 
 -- It's not even a real tradition! The National Turkey Federation has donated two turkeys to the White House every year since 1947. Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower did the sensible thing and simply ate the birds. No pardons there. 
 
 Some accounts credit John F. Kennedy with the first official turkey pardon, but like most JFK mythologizing, this is overblown sentimentality: Kennedy merely sent one of his turkeys back to the farm because it wasn't big enough. ""We'll let this one grow,"" he groused of the inadequate offering. (Others credit Abraham Lincoln, who once spared a turkey destined for Christmas dinner when his son Tad pleaded for mercy, but that clearly didn't catch on for decades.) 
 
 Ronald Reagan was technically the first president to ""pardon"" a Thanksgiving turkey, in 1987 — but he did it as a joke to distract the press from scandal. Reporters had been hounding the president about whether he planned to grant pardons to key Iran-Contra figures like Oliver North and John Poindexter. Reagan merely quipped that he would have pardoned that year's turkey had it not been en route to a petting zoo already. 
 
 Two years later, in 1989, Reagan's successor George H.W. Bush made the turkey pardon an annual ritual. But it all started as a glib one-liner meant to deflect attention away from White House lawbreaking. Hardly a sacred convention. 
 
 -- The pardoned turkeys aren't that much better off — because the life of a turkey is misery and pain. This is going to get gruesome, and I'm sorry about that. But modern-day domestic turkeys aren't bred to have a happy life. They're raised to be as large as possible so that they can be slaughtered as soon as possible and produce the greatest volume of delicious turkey meat. 
 
 Some fun facts: Turkeys bred for eating now grow to an average of 30 pounds — much bigger than wild turkeys.* (The two turkeys on their way to the White House are over 37 pounds apiece.) These domesticated turkeys are often so fat that their skeletons are unable to support that weight. They frequently develop bone deformities and degenerative joint diseases. They're incapable of breeding on their own. They often suffer heart failure or bleeding around the kidneys. 
 
 So it's no coincidence that, as US News & World Report and National Journal have discovered, most pardoned turkeys die within a year of being granted a reprieve anyway. The White House wants us to believe these turkeys are living out a life of leisure on the farm and bopping along to their favorite Lady Gaga tracks. Not so: 
 
 For the record, I'm not opposed to raising turkeys for food (and, yes, it's possible to get humanely raised turkeys). But it's not clear why we need an elaborate White House ceremony designed to obscure where that food actually comes from. 
 
 -- It's a mockery of the presidential pardon, which is an all-too neglected issue. Maybe this isn't surprising, since the turkey pardon was basically invented as a way of mocking presidential pardons. Still, it's worth mentioning. 
 
 After tomorrow, Obama will have ""pardoned"" 10 turkeys in all (turkeys that, as best we can tell, haven't actually committed any crimes). By contrast, he will have only pardoned or commuted the sentences of 40 actual living human beings. 
 
 The latter is a record low for modern-day presidents. At the same point in his presidency, Ronald Reagan had pardoned 313 people. Harry Truman had pardoned 1,537 people: 
 
 Last year, Sam Morrison, an official who spent 13 years in the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney before retiring in 2010, described the prevailing attitude toward pardons this way: ""They tend to view any grant of clemency not as a good thing, as a criminal justice success story, but almost as a defeat — that you're taking away something from what some good prosecutor achieved."" (The Justice Department disputed this characterization.) 
 
 Over at National Journal, Ron Fournier pointed out that, at the bare minimum, Obama could grant clemency to all the people still serving extra time in prison under the old crack-sentencing guidelines — guidelines that Obama himself opposed as excessive and which Congress reduced for all new prisoners in 2010. So far, however, there's no sign that the White House will do this. 
 
 The White House does, however, have a flashy Web site up letting you vote on your favorite soon-to-be-pardoned turkey. Yes, there are hashtags. 
 
 * Fixed the weight numbers. ||||| Story highlights Each year, an American president ""pardons"" a turkey or two just before Thanksgiving 
 
 President Barack Obama has sent his turkeys to Mt. Vernon for their ""twilight years"" 
 
 But a pardon just means the birds aren't stuffed and eaten; they're not expected to live long 
 
 American turkeys are bred to be consumed, many of them at Thanksgiving 
 
 Along a pastoral lane at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate sits a sizable wooden pen built specifically to house the two turkeys that will be ""pardoned"" at the White House on Wednesday. 
 
 The well-appointed pen includes a small coop to protect them from weather and foxes, and an area for them to strut their stuff for camera-toting tourists. 
 
 But there is one thing that is missing: other turkeys. That's because all the turkeys ever pardoned at the White House are dead, including the six already given a pass from the roasting pan by President Barack Obama in previous years. 
 
 ""The bird is bred for the table, not for longevity,"" said Dean Norton, the director at Mount Vernon in charge of livestock. ""Some of [the pardoned turkeys] have been pretty short lived."" 
 
 Compared to domesticated animals, turkeys bred for consumption are usually plump and slaughtered after a period of months, and wouldn't be expected to live much longer on their own. So, a pardon really can extend their lives a lot, relatively speaking.

 The two turkeys pardoned in 2012 - Cobbler and Gobbler - died within a year of their White House appearance, despite what a spokeswoman at Mount Vernon said was diligent veterinary care. 
 
 Gobbler died on February 5, 2013, of natural causes. Cobbler lived a bit longer, dying on August 22, 2013, after he fell ill and had to be euthanized. Both are buried at Mount Vernon. 
 
 In the two years prior, three of the four pardoned turkeys died less than five months after their pardon. 
 
 The other turkey - Peace, who was pardoned in 2011 - lived 16 months after arriving at Mount Vernon. 
 
 So why do those birds -- and others bred to be eaten -- die faster than their wild brethren? 
 
 ""The birds are fed in such a way to increase their weight,"" Norton, who has worked at Mount Vernon since 1969, said. ""[Americans] want a nice big breasted turkey and so they are fed high protein diet and they get quite large. The organs, though, that are in this bird are meant for a smaller bird. They just can't handle the extra weight, so they end up living not as long [as wild turkeys]."" 
 
 The differences extend beyond life expectancy, too. 
 
 ""Your native bird can fly beautifully and roost in trees,"" Norton said, while the type that receive pardons ""does not fly, has very short stubbly legs and typically last right up to Thanksgiving."" 
 
 Final years? Figuratively 
 
 In 2012, when Obama announced the pardons for Cobbler and Gobbler, he hinted the birds were in their final years, telling the audience that they were headed to Mount Vernon ""where they will spend their twilight years in the storied home of George Washington."" 
 
 The word ""years,"" however, seems to be an exaggeration. 
 
 The National Turkey Federation, a group that lobbies for the turkey industry and selects those to be honored each year at the White House, disagrees with any notion that the lives of these birds are cut short. 
 
 They are bred for consumption have a ""life expectancy of about 18 weeks,"" said Keith Williams, spokesman for the turkey federation. ""They are not raised as pets and animals are not pets."" 
 
 Their short lives, Williams points out, says more about Americans taste for turkey and breeding practices than mistreatment or short lives. 
 
 Bred to be stuffed 
 
 Starting in 1960, farmers specifically started breeding plump turkeys that had large amounts of white breast meat -- a response to American demand. The differences between wild and bred turkeys, Williams said, stems mostly from diet. 
 
 ""A turkey that is bred exclusively for eating, eats corn and soybean that have minerals in them,"" Williams said. 
 
 According to the federation, a whopping 219 million turkeys were consumed in the United States in 2011. On Thanksgiving that year, the group estimates 46 million were gobbled up. 
 
 Since 1970, around the time breeding practices changed, turkey consumption has increased 104 percent, according to the federation. 
 
 The practice of pardoning a turkey at the White House dates to Abraham Lincoln. 
 
 The story goes that around Thanksgiving, turkeys were brought to the White House and Lincoln's son, Tad, grew attached to one particular bird and begged his chief executive father to spare the fowl from the table. Lincoln agreed and the turkey lived. 
 
 It is unclear if the practice continued for the next 100 years. But in 1963, President John F. Kennedy decided to send his turkey back to the farm it came from, telling the National Turkey Federation they should ""just let this one grow"" instead. 
 
 Bush ""41"" sent them to Frying Pan Park 
 
 The tradition became official in 1989, under President George H.W. Bush. On November 14, weeks before Thanksgiving, Bush pardoned a turkey and the White House shipped him off to live his twilight year at -- Frying Pan Park -- in Herndon, Virginia. 
 
 Since then, a President has pardoned a turkey each year. 
 
 All of Obama's turkeys were sent to Mount Vernon. The birds spent the holidays in the public pen and then were moved to a livestock area out of view because they were not ""historically accurate"" to Washington's time period. 
 
 According to Norton, the turkey federation wanted the birds to be more prominently displayed. So this year, they will head to Morven Park, a historic estate in Leesburg, Virginia, on January 7. 
 
 The estate was home to Former Virginia Gov. Westmoreland Davis, who ran it from 1918 to 1922. Davis was a prodigious turkey farmer, according to Teresa Davenport, a spokeswoman for Morven Park. 
 
 As for the near certainty that the turkeys will soon die, Davenport said they ""are going to do everything [they] can to make that not happen."" 
 
 ""These turkeys were raised in Minnesota, so they are used to cold winters,"" Davenport said. ""A lot of the employees here are already on turkey duty.""","– President Obama will ""pardon"" a pair of turkeys today and send them to live at Mount Vernon, and if that gives you a case of the warm fuzzies, you should know that both ""Caramel"" and ""Popcorn"" will probably be dead within the year. Every turkey the president has ever pardoned is dead, including the two pardoned last year, CNN points out, with one only lasting until February. In the two previous years, three of the four died in less than five months (the other held out an impressive 16 months). The reason: The birds are bred for food, not longevity. Their normal-sized internal organs can only hold up to their carefully engineered bulk for so long. A spokesman for the National Turkey Federation, the lobbying group that provides the birds, says they have ""a life expectancy of about 18 weeks. They are not raised as pets."" It's one reason Brad Plumer at the Washington Post wants to end the pardon—the others being that it mocks real presidential pardons, and isn't nearly the historic tradition it pretends to be. Of course, at this point columns decrying the pardon are becoming a tradition of their own.",<pad> Thanksgiving turkeys are a waste of time.</s>,0.049999998938281276,0.0,0.049999998938281276

 Rio de Janeiro (AFP) - Record-breaking Australia -- inspired by Mack Horton and Cate Campbell -- put their stamp on the Rio Olympics and moved top of the medals table after an intense first day of action. 
 
 Bomb and bullet scares and a horrific double leg break were among the shocks on Saturday, while fans fumed over long queues for venues at Rio's Olympic Park. 
 
 But a trio of swimming world records and a first ever Olympic gold for Vietnam kept the focus on the sporting action as 12 titles were handed out. 
 
 There was joy for teenage American shooter Ginny Thrasher, who upset China's champions to snare the first gold of the Games in the women's 10m air pistol. 
 
 Belgium's Greg Van Avermaet won a crash-filled men's cycling road race, and rugby returned to the Games after a gap of 92 years. 
 
 Britain's Adam Peaty was the early star in the swimming pool. He set an eye-popping new world record of 57.55sec in the men's 100m breaststroke heats -- his first ever Olympic swim. 
 
 Later Hungary's Katinka Hosszu shattered the world record by more than two seconds to win the women's 4x100m individual medley. 
 
 But Australia dominated the first night in the pool, first when Horton dethroned China's Sun Yang to win the men's 400m freestyle. 
 
 Individual world record-holder Campbell then anchored Australia to 4x100m freestyle gold in 3min 30.65sec, the fastest time in history. 
 
 ""Definitely my favorite race ever, in an Olympic final with my sister and two girls I have known since I was 12, 13 years old and a gold and a world record,"" said Campbell, who swam with Emma McKeon, Brittany Elmslie and her sister Bronte. 
 
 ""You can't ask for more,"" said Bronte Campbell. ""Every kid dreams of it, it's what we always hoped for."" 
 
 The results pushed Australia to the top of the early medals table and confirmed their return to prominence in swimming, after their poor outing at London 2012. 
 
 The Rio Games started with an unwanted bang when a military bomb squad detonated a suspicious package near the finish of the men's cycle race at Copacabana beach, causing jitters among onlookers. 
 
 - Stray bullet - 
 
 At the equestrian venue at Deodoro, which is on a military base, a stray bullet ripped through the media centre's canvas roof and landed on the floor. 
 
 ""All authorities assured that the bullet was a stray bullet that has nothing to do with the Games or the Olympic family or the press. The area was not a target,"" said Games spokesman Mario Andrada. 
 
 Later Hoang Xuan Vinh wrote his name in the history books when he won the men's 10m air pistol, claiming the first ever gold medal for communist Vietnam. 
 
 ""It's the first gold medal in Vietnam's history, I feel very lucky,"" said the modest, 41-year-old military officer. 
 
 Thailand's Sopita Tanasan won the first weightlifting gold, the women's -48kg, with a total lift of 200kg. 
 
 Scandal-hit Russia, under fire over a massive doping scandal, got off the mark when Beslan Mudranov won the men's 60kg judo. 
 
 Van Avermaet avoided a crash on the final descent and overhauled leader Rafal Majka with a lung-busting sprint to win the 237.5km (147.5 miles) cycle race. 
 
 ""It was the hardest day I've ever had in my life on a bike,"" said Ireland's Dan Martin, who finished 13th, one place behind Tour de France winner Chris Froome. 
 
 Serbian rowers Milos Vasic and Nenad Bedik capsized in choppy waters at the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, but won a reprieve when they were allowed to move into the next round. 
 
 French gymnast Samir Ait Said suffered Olympic agony. His lower left leg snapped and skewed to a gruesome angle when he landed awkwardly from a vault. 
 
 Yusra Mardini, the Syrian refugee who was swimming for her life to a Greek island less than a year ago, won her 100m butterfly heat but failed to reach the semi-finals. 
 
 ""Everything was amazing. It was the only thing I ever wanted was to compete in the Olympics,"" said the 18-year-old, who is representing the Games' first ever refugee team. ||||| Officials stand near the body of a man that was shot and killed near Maracana Stadium. (Photo: Mark Humphrey, AP) 
 
 RIO DE JANEIRO — Rio police say a man was shot dead near Maracana Stadium after Friday's Olympic opening ceremony. 
 
 According to Rio's Civil Police Department, a 22-year-old Brazilian named Ronaldo Marques de Souza was assaulting people in the crowd as the 53,000 attendees were being let out of the stadium. An officer from an unidentified agency who was assisting with Olympic security responded and shot the man, according to a statement. 
 
 Brazilian officials have pulled in police from around the country to conduct security around the Games, a total of 85,000 law enforcement officials. The statement from Rio police said the officer came from another state in Brazil, but did not specify which one. 
 
 Associated Press photographers gave a different account of the shooting. They reported hearing multiple, loud gun shots, forcing Games volunteers and others leaving the ceremony to duck for cover behind cars. The photographers said they then saw a shooter running from the scene and fleeing in a car close to a university parking lot. 
 
 After police and medics arrived on the scene, paramedics were seen treating the victim as blood poured from his body onto the road. 
 
 Rio police says it is continuing its investigation. 
 
 This is the second shooting death in the Olympic city this week, and that one has varying descriptions as well. Brazil police originally said a Russian diplomat fought off a would-be robber, whose gun went off. The alleged assailant was killed. The Russian embassy, though, said no Russian official was involved. ||||| Rio De Janeiro: A stray bullet, believed to have been fired from a Brazilian military rifle, has narrowly missed photographers during the first day of Olympic competition at the Equestrian Centre in Rio De Janeiro. 
 
 Olympic organisers and the military are trying to work out where the bullet, which pierced the plastic roof of the media centre canvas and landed within metres of photographers, came from. 
 
 British freelance photographer Jon Stroud, who was sitting closest to where the bullet landed, expanded on the frightening ordeal which shocked the entire media centre located next to the Brazilian military base in Deodoro. 
 
 ""It was general disbelief,"" Stroud said.

 Despite being so close to the military base, Stroud said he was flabbergasted anyone was allowed to fire a shot with thousands of people flocking to many of the Olympic venues through the rough streets of Deodoro. 
 
 ""If anything I feel a bit amazed that during an Olympic competition, albeit the fact we're on a military site, that there could be any kind of sanctioned live fire within range of any kind of where we all are,"" Stroud said. 
 
 ""I can't begin to imagine who thought that was a good thing.""

 An investigation between police, military and Olympic organisers is taking place to determine where the bullet came from. 
 
 But a Rio Olympics spokesperson insists ""100 per cent it has nothing to do with the Games.""

 ""It was a stray bullet. They can also confirm it has nothing to do with the Games, but they cannot be more precise at the moment. All investigations are being carried out with army, technical experts, local police.

 ||||| A stray bullet fired into a media tent at the equestrian venue and a controlled explosion near the finish line of the road cycling threatened to overshadow the opening day of action at the 2016 Olympics.

 Even as organisers scrambled to investigate both issues, they were also having to promise to redouble efforts to shift unsold tickets and improve long queueing times amid angry complaints from those who had not been able to enter venues in time to watch the action. 
 
 While there was an upbeat mood in the city and organisers were pleased with the reaction to Friday’s opening ceremony, empty seats in many venues and long queues to get into others soon caused frustration and delays. 
 
 The most dramatic incident of the day came as eyewitnesses reported a bullet from a 5.56mm assault rifle pierced the roof of the media tent and fell to the floor near a Team GB press officer and a British photographer working for the British Equestrian Foundation. 
 
 The venue is next door to a media base and there was speculation that it may have accidentally been fired from there. A Rio 2016 spokesman said: “We are aware of the incident and monitoring the investigation by the security forces. No one was hurt.” 
 
 At Copacabana, as crowds gathered to watch the denouement to the men’s cycling road race, there was a brief commotion when bomb control officers arrived suddenly to detonate a suspect package about 150 yards from the finish line. “The security services found a suspicious package … and as a precaution decided to perform a controlled explosion,” said a Rio 2016 spokesman. 
 
 Officials said there was no impact on the race, which was at that point only halfway through. The suspect package was believed to be a small bag. 
 
 On the morning after the opening ceremony the night before, largely well received by the Brazilian media and public, organisers hoped to maintain the momentum. But huge swaths of empty seats visible in the gymnastics, boxing, handball, rugby sevens and hockey arenas as the action got under way detracted from the picture postcard backdrops on show elsewhere. 
 
 On Copacabana, fans faced huge queues to enter the beach volleyball arena while others waited in line to buy tickets. Meanwhile the action started in front of largely empty stands, although they were much fuller later with Brazilian athletes in action. 
 
 While some queues were good-natured, at others fans became angry at having to endure lengthy security queues. “I don’t believe it. It’s absurd, ridiculous,” said Natalia Carvalho, 28, a Rio resident who had wanted to see Brazilian gymnast and medal hopeful Arthur Zanetti compete. 
 
 Games organisers blamed the situation on a lack of coordination between various groups of security personnel, including the police, Games staff and private security firms. The Rio 2016 director of communications blamed it on the fact “the systems did not talk to each other”. 
 
 In a later statement, organisers said: “We apologise to any spectators who have had to queue on the first day of competition. We are fully aware of the problem and frustration it causes. We requested that the relevant authorities increase the speed and effectiveness that people can enter the park by requesting more employees to work on the x-ray machines. 
 
 “Following improvements the lines returned to normal by mid-morning. We appreciate the patience and understanding shown by fans and will use this experience to improve for the forthcoming days of competition.” 
 
 The Deodoro Stadium in the north of the city was almost entirely empty at 11am when rugby returned to the Olympics, except for a few small bands of travelling fans cowering in the shade. But it filled up a little before Brazil’s match against Great Britain, as a few hundred home fans turned out to cheer their team.

 At the morning swimming heats at the Aquatics Centre on the Olympic Park in Barra, about 20km from central Rio, the stands were roughly a third full. Venues started to fill up as the day went on and in previous Games, notably in Beijing, there have been empty seats in the first few days and stands have become fuller as the fortnight has gone on. 
 
 But there remains substantial scepticism over the official figure of 80%, or 4.9m, tickets having been sold. As revealed by the Guardian earlier this week, organisers outlined plans to give away ticket to schoolchildren. The first tranche will involve around 240,000 tickets at less popular sports such as rugby sevens and golf. 
 
 “As we have already reached 100% of our revenue target, where we have places available for some sessions, we will give the opportunity to students of our education programme, Transforma, volunteers, and other partner projects, as part of our engagement effort,” said a spokesman. 
 
 “We are conducting the first Olympic Games in South America and we want to take this opportunity to bring the sports and the athletes closer to the warmth of the young Brazilians.” 
 
 Organisers have also accelerated their advertising campaign to sell tickets for less popular sports under the slogan “There is emotion in every place”. 
 
 A spokesman said that there was a daily acceleration in sales and that they were relying on the fact Brazilians traditionally bought tickets at the last minute. 
 
 However, the website shows that tickets remain available not only for the football and less popular sports but for some of the blue riband events on the track and in the pool.","– It's been an eventful first two days for the Rio Olympics, but probably not in the way organizers were hoping. Brazilian police say an officer shot and killed a 22-year-old man who was attacking people as they left Maracana stadium Friday following the opening ceremony, USA Today reports. According to AFP, the man was mugging people. But reporters at the scene say it happened completely differently. They say people ducked for cover when gunshots rang out as thousands of people left the stadium. They then saw the shooter running into a nearby car and driving off. On Saturday, the Brazilian military executed a controlled explosion near the finish line of the men's road cycling race. They were blowing up a suspicious bag that had been left unattended, the Guardian reports. Officials say the bag may have belonged to a homeless man, but they had to take precautions. The racers were 60 miles away at the time, but the explosion ""stunned"" people hoping to watch the end of the race, according to AFP. The Sydney Morning Herald reports a bullet came ripping through the media room at the Deodora equestrian center and landed near a photographer Saturday. No one was hurt, but the bullet left a hole in the tent's roof. The venue is near a military base, and it's possible the bullet was accidentally fired toward the venue by someone on the base.","<pad> Rio de Janeiro (AFP) - Record-breaking Australia -- inspired by Mack Horton and Cate Campbell -- put their stamp on the Rio Olympics and moved top of the medals table after an intense first day of action.

 According to the paper, Americans work nearly 25% more hours than Europeans. In other words, that’s an additional 258 hours per year or an hour more each weekday. The working paper, which has not yet been published, was written by three economists—Alexander Bick of Arizona State University, Bettina Bruggeman of McMaster University in Ontario, and Nicola Fuchs-Schundeln of Goethe University Frankfurt. 
 
 The authors looked at 18 European countries and the U.S. Of the 19 total countries they examined, the U.S. came out on top averaging 26.1 hours per person per week; Italy worked the fewest hours with an average of 18.4 hours. 
 
 The study looked at hours per person. It doesn’t only include people currently in the workforce, but those either retired or taking time off for some other reason, like unemployment or vacation. Ultimately, it doesn’t measure productivity, but rather total time spent at work. 
 
 The disparity in hours worked between the U.S. and Europe could be explained in various ways or, more likely, is an amalgamation of numerous different reasons. Taxes, for one, are much higher in Europe than in the U.S. According to Bloomberg, that gives European workers less incentive to work longer hours. It may also have something to do with labor unions, which generally have more power in Europe than they do in the U.S. 
 
 Additionally, Europeans tend to get generous pensions, rather than investment plans like the 401(k) many American workers receive. As a result, there are more American workers over 65-years-old now than there have been at any point in the past 50 years.","– Feel like you're working too much? Consider moving to Europe: Europeans work 19% fewer hours than US workers, or about one hour less per weekday, a new paper finds. Researchers looked at three labor-force surveys from the US and Europe to find out how many hours a person works, on average, in various countries. They found that Americans work an average of 1,353 hours per year, the highest number of the 19 countries studied, Fortune reports. Compare that to Italy, where each person only works an average of 960 hours per year, the lowest number of hours of any country studied. Americans are also retiring later, taking less vacation time, and, as Quartz reports, are more likely to work odd hours, such as the middle of the night or weekends. As recently as the early 1970s, US and Western European workers actually clocked about the same number of hours, Bloomberg reports. It's not clear what's changed or how to account for the discrepancy, but some economists point to the fact that there's more incentive to work harder for a promotion in the US, because people earn a wider range of incomes there than in Europe, so it's more likely they'll get a significant raise. There's also the fact that taxes are significantly higher in Europe, meaning that there's less of an incentive to work more hours and earn more money that will be taxed. Finally, there's the fact that labor unions and worker protections are stronger in Europe, and pensions are more generous there.","<pad> – The US is the most productive country in the world, but it's not the only one.

 An aid convoy has reached the besieged rebel-held Syrian town of Madaya, bringing vital food and medicines. 
 
 Distribution will continue through the night to 40,000 people who have been trapped for six months by a government blockade and without aid since October. 
 
 The UN says it has received credible reports of people dying of starvation. 
 
 Simultaneously, aid lorries entered two villages besieged by rebel forces in the northern province of Idlib under a deal between the warring parties. 
 
 The situation in Foah and Kefraya is also said to be extremely dire, with an estimated 20,000 people trapped there since March. 
 
 The arrival of the aid was delayed until both sets of lorries were ready to enter.

 Pawel Krzysiek, who is with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Madaya, said after arriving: ""The people... were coming every five minutes asking, 'Listen, did you bring food, did you bring medicine?' 
 
 ""Some are smiling and waving at us but many are just simply too weak, with a very bleak expression, too tired."" 
 
 War of words - Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent, BBC News, Beirut 
 
 This humanitarian mission was forged by a cruel conflict. Aid for rebel-held Madaya was contingent on help for government-controlled Foah and Kefraya. 
 
 Images of Madaya's emaciated children sparked alarm in many capitals and created greater impetus but they also provoked a war of words. 
 
 Supporters of the Syrian government and its Lebanese Hezbollah allies accused rebel forces in Madaya of seizing food for themselves. Some even mocked reports of starvation. The opposition charged President Assad's forces with more war crimes. 
 
 Today, Madaya is the face of Syria's suffering. Two years ago, it was Yarmouk. 
 
 These are moments that mobilise the world's sympathy but over the past year, only 10% of the UN's requests to deliver aid to people to in besieged and hard-to-reach areas were granted. That is where 4.5 million Syrians live.

 One resident, Hiba Abdel Rahman, 17, told Agence France-Presse: ""For 15 days we have been eating only soup. 
 
 ""I saw a young man killing cats and presenting the meat to members of his family as rabbit. Some people went through garbage bins, others ate grass. We sought food from the fighters but they refused to give it to us."" 
 
 In total, some 44 lorries operated by the UN, the ICRC, the Syrian Red Crescent and the World Food Programme reached Madaya from the capital, Damascus. 
 
 Image copyright Reuters Image caption A few people have been given permission to leave Madaya 
 
 Another 21 entered Foah and Kefraya. 
 
 They were carrying basic food items - including rice, vegetable oil, flour, sugar and salt - as well as water, infant formula, blankets, medicines and surgical supplies. 
 
 Marianne Gasser, head of the ICRC's Syria delegation, said the deliveries should not be one-offs. 
 
 She said: ""To relieve the suffering of these tens of thousands of people, there has to be regular access to these areas."" 
 
 A few residents were given permission to leave and could be seen with belongings awaiting evacuation. 
 
 Madaya, which is about 25km (15 miles) north-west of Damascus and 11km from the border with Lebanon, been besieged since early July by government forces and their allies in Lebanon's Shia Islamist Hezbollah movement. 
 
 Brice de la Vigne from the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) described the situation in the town as ""quite horrific"". 
 
 Mr de la Vigne, whose organisation supports a health centre in Madaya, told the BBC that more than 250 people there had ""acute malnutrition"". 
 
 'Ambiguous information' in local media - BBC Monitoring 
 
 Madaya is a major talking point in the Arabic media, with attitudes ranging from sympathy for its trapped inhabitants to anger at allegedly fake imagery. 
 
 Two pan-Arab satellite television channels that take a firmly pro-rebel line - Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya and Qatar's Al Jazeera - say the Syrian government and its Hezbollah allies are ""starving Madaya to death"". 
 
 But Syrian state and allied media dismiss the ""rumours"". Al-Baath newspaper accuses Al Jazeera and Al-Arabiya of a ""misleading campaign, using photos of displaced and sick people from all over the world"", and says the rebels are using civilians as human shields, 
 
 Some commentators try to take a broader view. Muhammad Kharrub in the Jordanian newspaper, Al-Rai, complains that the rebels themselves are besieging government-held towns, and Mahir Maqlad in Egypt's Al-Ahram notes that both sides ""keep their information ambiguous to suit their own interests"". 
 
 MSF said on Sunday that a total of 28 people - including six children less than one year old - had died of starvation in Madaya since 1 December. 
 
 However, Hezbollah has denied that there have been any deaths in the town, and accused rebel leaders of preventing people from leaving. 
 
 Blockades have been a feature of Syria's civil war. Up to 4.5 million people live in hard-to-reach areas, including nearly 400,000 people in 15 besieged locations who do not have access to life-saving aid. 
 
 In a separate development on Monday, activists said at least 12 children had been killed in an air strike on a school in the rebel-held town of Ain Jara, in Aleppo province. 
 
 What's happening in Syria? 
 
 More than 250,000 Syrians have lost their lives in almost five years of conflict, which began with anti-government protests before escalating into a brutal civil war. More than 11 million others have been forced from their homes as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and rebels opposed to his rule battle each other - as well as jihadist militants from Islamic State. 
 
 Why are civilians under siege? 
 
 All parties to the conflict are using siege warfare, encircling populated areas, preventing civilians from leaving and blocking humanitarian access in an attempt to force opponents to surrender. Shortages of food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel have led to malnutrition and deaths among vulnerable groups. 
 
 Where are the sieges? 
 
 Government forces are besieging various locations in the eastern Ghouta area, outside Damascus, as well as the capital's western suburb of Darayya and the nearby mountain towns of Zabadani and Madaya. Rebel forces have encircled the villages of Foah and Kefraya in the northern province of Idlib, while IS militants are besieging government-held areas in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour. ||||| BEIRUT, Lebanon — In the hills near the Lebanese border, an hour’s drive from downtown Damascus, much of a Syrian town is starving, according to residents and international humanitarian workers. 
 
 The town, Madaya, is controlled by rebels and encircled by pro-government forces with barbed wire, land mines and snipers. People there make soups of grass, spices and olive leaves. They eat donkeys and cats. They arrive, collapsing, at a clinic that offers little but rehydration salts. Neighbors fail to recognize neighbors in the streets because their faces are so sunken. 
 
 Syria, once classified as a middle-income country, now reports periodic malnutrition deaths. At least 28 people, including six babies, have died from hunger-related causes at a clinic in Madaya aided by Doctors Without Borders, medics there say. And the 42,000 people that the United Nations counts as trapped in Madaya are about a tenth of those stranded in besieged or hard-to-reach areas as conditions grow steadily worse. 
 
 Their plight represents a stark failure of international powers that has worsened even as they intensify military and diplomatic activities, all in the name of resolving the conflict. ||||| Play Facebook

 The United Nations warned that nearly 42,000 are at risk of hunger or starvation there, and a doctor in the town told NBC News that residents have resorted to eating cats. 
 
 The Syrian government agreed late last week to allow aid into Madaya and two other towns — Kefraya and Foua — where residents were facing starvation. 
 
 The U.N.-supported convoy set out on Monday with the Red Cross and Syrian Red Crescent and the first trucks were able to enter on Monday afternoon. 
 
 ""Offloading of aid expected to last throughout night,"" a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross posted on Twitter. 
 
 The convoy was expected to bring food for around 40,000 people to last a month in Madaya, though the International Red Cross warned last week the trip could be dangerous. 
 
 ""Whatever we bring in, it's not enough,"" said Iyad Nasr, a spokesman for the U.N.'s OCHA. He told NBC News that the U.N. and others were hoping for unconditional access to the town and other besieged villages. ||||| DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Aid convoys were heading to besieged villages in northern Syria and near the Lebanese border on Monday, Syria's official news agency and humanitarian groups said, as residents gathered in the streets for desperately needed food and medicine. 
 
 SANA said the deliveries were headed toward the adjacent Shiite villages of Foua and Kfarya in Idlib province, under siege by rebels seeking to oust President Bashar Assad, as well as toward Madaya, which is blockaded by government troops and the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group. 
 
 The aid operation was agreed on last week. Activists have reported several deaths from starvation over the past weeks in the affected areas, and images of starvation have been circulated across social media. 
 
 The United Nations and Red Cross also reported that the convoys were on their way, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the aid was expected to reach the towns in the coming hours. 
 
 The television channel of Hezbollah, which is fighting in Syria alongside Assad's forces, reported that 40 trucks were expected to enter the northern villages, with another 40 headed to Madaya. In Madaya, Al-Manar showed a group of people including women and children waiting for the convoys at the town's main entrance. 
 
 The U.N.'s World Food Programme has said it will ship one month's worth of food for more than 40,000 people to Madaya from Damascus, and enough for 20,000 people to Foua and Kfarya from the city of Homs. 
 
 Also Monday, SANA reported that rocket fire presumably fired by rebels hit a residential neighborhood in the northern city of Aleppo, killing three children and wounding two other people. It said the Syrian army had begun a large offensive in the countryside to the west of the city. 
 
 And in the northern village of Kafranbel, two prominent activists were released after being detained by the extremist Nusra Front. 
 
 The two men, Raed Fares and Hadi Abdullah, were abducted by Nusra, al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate, in an early morning raid Sunday that saw their opposition radio station, Radio Fresh, shut down. 
 
 The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists and other sources inside Syria, reported their release some 12 hours later. The release was also noted on the station's social media pages. 
 
 In Damascus, Iran's interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, reasserted his country's support for Syria at a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart, Mohammad al-Shaar. 
 
 ""The Syrian government has demanded our support against terrorism and we, anyway, stood alongside (President Bashar) Assad, who enjoys his people's support,"" he said. ""We see the conditions in Syria are moving forward in a good way.""

 The computer's hard drive appeared to have been badly damaged with a hammer or screw driver, law enforcement authorities told ABC News, complicating efforts to exploit it for evidence. 
 
 Officials have ""seized significant evidence at [Lanza's] residence,"" said Connecticut State Police spokesman Paul Vance, adding that the process of sifting through that much forensic evidence would be a lengthy and ""painstaking process."" 
 
 Authorities also told ABC News that the weapons used in Friday's rampage at Sandyhook Elementary School, which left dead 20 children and seven adults including Lanza's mother Nancy, were purchased by his mother between 2010 and 2012. 
 
 According to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, Lanza visited shooting ranges several times in recent years, and went at least one time with his mother. 
 
 The first funeral for a child killed in the massacre was held today in Fairfield, Conn., where mourners gathered to remember the too-short life of first-grader Noah Pozner. 
 
 Authorities also revealed this morning that two adult women shot during the rampage survived and their accounts will likely be integral to the investigation. 
 
 ""Investigators will, in fact, speak with them when it's medically appropriate and they will shed a great deal of light on the facts and circumstances of this tragic investigation,"" Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance said at a news conference today. 
 
 Both survivors are women and are now home from the hospital after being shot, police said. Officials had previously mentioned just one adult survivor. The women have not been identified and police did not give details on their injuries.

 Police say Adam Lanza, 20, forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, spraying bullets on students and faculty. Lanza killed 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself. 
 
 Lanza also killed his mother Nancy Lanza at the home they shared before going to school. 
 
 ""There are many, many witnesses that need to be interviewed,"" Vance said. ""We will not stop until we have interviewed every last one of them."" 
 
 Vance said the investigation could take weeks or months to complete. ""It's not something done in 60 minutes like you see on T.V."" 
 
 Some of the other key witnesses will be children who survived the shooting spree by playing dead, hiding in closets and bathrooms and being rescued by dedicated teachers. 
 
 ""Any interviews with any children will be done with professionals...as appropriate,"" Vance said. ""We'll handle that extremely delicately when the time arises."" 
 
 CLICK HERE for a tribute to the shooting victims. 
 
 The first funerals for victims of the shooting are today, beginning with 6-year-olds Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto. 
 
 Officials said today that the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where the shooting took place, will be closed ""indefinitely."" 
 
 Both the school and the home where shootings took place are being held by police as crime scenes and Vance predicted authorities would spend ""months"" investigating the elementary school. 
 
 All Newtown schools are closed today to give residents more time to cope. Every school except for Sandy Hook is expected to re-open Tuesday. 
 
 The town of Monroe has offered to open to Sandy Hook students the Chalk Hill School, a former middle school that currently houses the town's EMS and recreational departments. 
 
 Officials in Monroe, less than 10 miles from Newtown, say the building could be ready for students by the end of the week, but have not yet set a date to resume classes. 
 
 Nearly 100 volunteers are working to ensure the building complies with fire and security regulations and are working to retorfit the school with bathroom facilities for young children. 
 
 ""We're working to make the school safe and secure for students,"" said Monroe Police Department spokesman Lt. Brian H. McCauley. 
 
 The neighboring community's school is expected to be ready to accommodate students in the next few days, though an exact schedule has not yet been published. 
 
 While the families grieve, federal and state authorities are working around the clock to answer the question on so many minds: ""Why?"" 
 
 ABC News has learned that investigators have seized computers belonging to Adam Lanza from the home he shared with his mother. Three weapons were found at the school scene and a fourth was recovered from Lanza's car. Lanza had hundreds of rounds and used multiple high-capacity magazines when he went on the rampage, according to Connecticut State Police. 
 
 Vance said that every single electronic device, weapon and round will be thoroughly examined and investigated as well as every aspect of Lanza's life going ""back to the date of birth."" 
 
 ABC News has learned that both the shooter and his mother spent time at an area gun range; however it was not yet known whether they had shot there. 
 
 President Obama delivered an emotional address at an interfaith prayer vigil in Newtown on Sunday night, comforting the community. 
 
 ""I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation,"" the president said. ""I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps to know you are not alone ... and that all across this land we have wept with you."" 
 
 ""These tragedies must end,"" Obama said. ""And to end them we must change."" 
 
 Thousands came out of the prayer vigil where Red Cross members distributed stuffed dogs to children and adults wept in the auditorium. 
 
 ""We needed this. We needed to be together, here in this room, in the gymnasium, outside the doors of this school, in living rooms around the world,"" said Rev. Matt Crebbin, senior minister of the Newtown Congregational Church. ""These darkest days of our community shall not be the final word heard from us."" ||||| Investigators have not managed to retrieve any data from a computer they took from the house where the gunman in the Newtown, Conn., school shootings lived with his mother because he had all but destroyed the hard drive, a senior law enforcement official said Monday. 
 
 “It looked like he took steps to damage it — he smashed it,” said the official, adding that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had joined the State Police in an unsuccessful effort to recover data that might lead to some understanding of what might have prompted the gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, to go on a rampage. 
 
 He began at his own house, shooting his mother, Nancy Lanza, with one of the five weapons that were registered to her there, and then moved to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, where he killed 20 first graders and 6 school employees with a semiautomatic assault rifle. Some were hit 11 times. 
 
 But the official said it did not appear that Mr. Lanza had left any letters or notes that would offer a motive for the killings, or explain why he had targeted the school. 
 
 As investigators continued to examine other evidence they had seized, the first funerals were held on a gloomy and chaotic day that brought word of a second survivor, a school employee who was wounded but had not been mentioned in earlier accounts of the carnage. Her name was not immediately released. The other survivor at Sandy Hook was identified as the school’s lead teacher, Natalie Hammond, 40. 
 
 The spokesman for the State Police, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said investigators would “examine everything and anything,” including cellphones, game consoles and “anything that can provide us with information” about Mr. Lanza and his motivations for the rampage.

 But he provided no indication as to why Mr. Lanza had trained such firepower on the students in two classrooms at the school. Lieutenant Vance said Mr. Lanza had “no connection” to the school. 
 
 Mr. Lanza, 20, lived with his mother in a house about five miles away. She owned the guns he fired and the car he drove to the school. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have determined that Mr. Lanza and his mother had visited firing ranges, sometimes together, sometimes separately, according to a federal law enforcement official. The agents have been interviewing firearm dealers in Connecticut to “get a clear picture of what activities took place” before the shooting, said the official, who would not identify the shooting ranges. 
 
 Monday brought a new and grim reality to schools across the country. In some places, armed officers greeted students amid tighter safety procedures, and education officials rethought their security policies. There was a large police presence outside a funeral home in Newtown after what Lt. James Perez of the Fairfield Police Department described as vague threats of protests and “stupid comments” on the Internet and on social media. 
 
 In Ridgefield, Conn., a half-hour’s drive from Newtown, the police received a call about a “suspicious” stranger dressed in black and carrying what appeared to be a rifle. He was said to be walking from a train station toward an elementary school before the school day had even begun. 
 
 Officials ordered a lockdown — effectively a lockout, since most of the students were on school buses that had not arrived yet. The buses were diverted to another school while the police searched the area. The students were let into the school about four hours later, and the police eventually arrested a suspect, Wilfredo M. Seda, 22, of Redding, Conn. He had an umbrella that “had the outward appearance of a Samurai sword,” the Ridgefield police said in a statement. He was charged with a breach of the peace. 
 
 In Newtown, classes were canceled on Monday, and it was not clear whether students would ever attend classes in the Sandy Hook building again. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy approved an arrangement for the students to use a surplus school building a few miles away, in Monroe, and the children’s desks from Sandy Hook were moved there. 
 
 Mr. Malloy held an emotional news conference in Hartford during which he described his decision to tell the last, desperate parents at the firehouse in Newtown on Friday that none of their loved ones had survived the massacre. Struggling to keep his composure, the governor said that it had become clear there was no protocol that could be followed, and that rather than relying on the traditional routine of having relatives identify a body, he felt the best thing to do was simply to tell them there was no hope.

 “I made the decision that to have that go on any longer was wrong,” he said. 
 
 Mr. Lanza’s mother had divorced his father, Peter J. Lanza, in 2008, citing “irreconcilable differences” after 27 years of marriage. The couple had joint custody of Adam Lanza, but he was expected to “reside primarily with the mother,” according to divorce settlement papers filed in Stamford Superior Court. 
 
 The settlement was generous to Ms. Lanza and her sons — Adam had an older brother, Ryan. She got the family house, and Mr. Lanza was to provide $240,000 a year in alimony starting in 2010. The amount was to increase annually through 2015, when it was to reach $298,800.

 But while the settlement said Peter Lanza was responsible for paying the two sons’ college tuition and for providing “a car for their son Adam” — if Adam wanted one, and if Ms. Lanza paid for the insurance — Ms. Lanza was responsible for unreimbursed medical expenses. Those, the settlement said, included “hospital, optical, psychiatric, psychological and nursing expenses.” 
 
 A mediator who worked with the couple told The Associated Press that they told her that Adam Lanza had received a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. 
 
 Some details about Adam Lanza’s teenage years also emerged. Around the time the divorce was in the works, he attended Western Connecticut State University as a part-time student. He did not make much of an impression. 
 
 Prof. Renate Ludanyi, the director of the university’s German studies center, said that Mr. Lanza was a student in her class during spring 2009, according to her grade books. But she said her memories of him were faint. “If at all I remember a quiet kid, a quiet young man sitting by the door,” she said. 
 
 Mr. Lanza dropped out of the class before the final grades were compiled. His grades until then had been “medium to not very good,” she said. ||||| Computerworld - The FBI is reportedly examining a hard drive found in the bedroom of Connecticut school shooter Adam Lanza in the hopes that they can glean insight into the 20-year-old's activities before the Friday rampage that left 28 people -- including Lanza himself -- dead. 
 
 Although police have refused to publicly confirm that they're using forensics technology to retrieve information from the drive, published reports cited police officials who said a drive, broken into pieces, was found outside of Lanza's computer. 
 
 According to those sources, FBI forensics experts will examine the drive to try to figure out who Lanza corresponded with before the massacre and how else he may have used the computer. 
 
 Lanza, who lived in his mother's Newtown, Conn. home, shot his mother in the head with a rifle early Friday, according to police. He then went to Sandy Hook Elementary School with his mother's AR-15 .223 caliber rifle, two semi-automatic handguns and enough ammunition to kill everyone in the school, police said. Lanza killed 20 students, all of them 6 or 7 years old, and six faculty members before police arrived. He committed suicide at the school by shooting himself. 
 
 Little is known about Lanza's personal life. According to media reports, his mother was a private person who rarely talked about her son. 
 
 ""They're going to try to find a reason why...he went from fanaticizing about this to doing it,"" said Marc Rogers, chair of the Cyber Forensics Program in the Department of Computer and Information Technology at Purdue University. ""Were there any early indications that he was getting ready to act these fantasies out? In some cases there are and in some there aren't."" 
 
 Lanza's rampage was likely done for ""maximum media impact,"" Rogers said, so investigators will also be looking for a manifesto or some other statement the 20-year-old may have left on his computer or communicated to someone electronically. 
 
 Michael Kessler, CEO of forensics data recovery firm Kessler International, said that if Lanza knew enough to remove the hard drive from his computer and break it, it's unlikely investigators will be able to retrieve data from it. 
 
 ""Obviously, they [law enforcement] have a lot of resources to do it. And, if the drive's platters aren't smashed they can put them into another drive and read them,"" he said. ""But if he [Lanza] broke the platters, the likelihood of data recovery is slim to none."" 
 
 According to Brian Cane, a consultant with ECO Data Recovery in Florida, the recovery effort will hinge on how technically savvy Lanza was - whether or not he knew to break, scratch or drill holes in his drive platters.","– A computer found at Adam Lanza's home had been smashed and the hard drive damaged with a hammer or screwdriver, and investigators now say they have been unable to recover data from it that could shed light on the motive for the Connecticut school shooting, reports the New York Times. The computer was among large amounts of evidence seized from the home Lanza shared with his mother as part of a painstaking investigation that is expected to take months, ABC reports. Experts had earlier told ComputerWorld that the recovery effort would depend on whether Lanza knew enough to break, scratch, or puncture the drive platters. ""If the drive's platters aren't smashed they can put them into another drive and read them,"" the CEO of forensics data recovery firm Kessler International says. ""But if he broke the platters, the likelihood of data recovery is slim to none.""

 Chiribiquete National Park, the largest protected area in Colombia, is the confluence point of four biogeographical provinces: Orinoquia, Guyana, Amazonia, and North Andes. As such, the National Park guarantees the connectivity and preservation of the biodiversity of these provinces, constituting itself as an interaction scenario in which flora and fauna diversity and endemism have flourished. One of the defining features of Chiribiquete is the presence of tepuis (table-top mountains), sheer-sided sandstone plateaux that outstand in the forest and result in dramatic scenery that is reinforced by its remoteness, inaccessibility and exceptional conservation. Over 75,000 figures have been made by indigenous people on the walls of the 60 rock shelters from 20,000 BCE, and are still made nowadays by the uncontacted peoples protected by the National Park. These paintings depict hunting scenes, battles, dances and ceremonies, as well as fauna and flora species, with a particular the worship of the jaguar, a symbol of power and fertility. The indigenous communities, which are not directly present on the site, consider Chiribiquete as a sacred place that cannot be visited and that should be preserved unaltered. ||||| Mysterious stone spheres dot the Pre-Colombian Chiefdom Settlements of the Diquis in Costa Rica, which is now a World Heritage site. 
 
 Enigmatic archaeological sites in Costa Rica dotted with mysterious stone spheres are among six new spots newly designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 
 
 The stone sphere sites, on the Diquis Delta in southern Costa Rica, join places like the Great Wall of China and Yellowstone National Park on the list of 1,007 sites designated as World Heritage Sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The organization lists places that are ""of outstanding universal value,"" based on criteria such as representing a masterpiece of creative genius, recording testimony of a vanished civilization, or containing exceptional natural beauty. 
 
 The U.N.'s World Heritage Committee, currently meeting in Doha, Qatar, announced the additions to the list today (June 23). Other than the Diquis Delta sites, the new honorees include the architectural remnants of a medieval Eurasian city, spectacular landscapes in Vietnam and India, a wildlife sanctuary in the Philippines and a site offering geological evidence of the meteorite collision that killed off the dinosaurs. [See Photos of the New World Heritage Sites] 
 
 The new sites are: 
 
 1. Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex, the Russian Federation: Along the banks of the Volga River, south of Kazan, Tatarstan, is an archaeological site containing the remnants of the medieval city of Bolgar. Built in the seventh century by a civilization called the Volga-Bolgars, Bolgar remained an important town until the 15th century, according to UNESCO. In the 1200s, it was the capital of the Golden Horde, the northwestern region of the Mongol Empire. The Volga-Bolgars converted to Islam in A.D. 922, and the site remains a destination for pilgrimages by Tatar Muslims today. 
 
 2. Pre-Colombian Chiefdom Settlements with Stone Spheres of the Diquis, Costa Rica: Consisting of four archaeological sites in the Diquis Delta, this new site encompasses the archaeological remains of human civilization before Europeans arrived in Costa Rica. The sites date to between A.D. 500 and 1500 and include burial sites, paved areas and mounds, according to UNESCO. Most intriguing, however, are the stone spheres that dot the sites. These spheres range in size from 2.3 feet to 8.4 feet (0.7 to 2.57 meters) in diameter, and many remain in the locations where they were placed centuries ago. No one knows how the stones were made — or why. [The 7 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth] 
 
 3. Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex, Vietnam: The stunning landscape on the south side of the Red River delta in Vietnam earned this area a place on the UNESCO list. Dramatic limestone peaks and mountainside caves define this region of so-called karst topography. (Karst landscapes are formed when easily dissolvable rocks such as limestone erode into impressive shapes, typically pockmarked with caves.) The caves contain artifacts of human settlement dating back 30,000 years. Today, the site also includes Hoa Lu, the capital of Vietnam in the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as villages, temples and farms.

 4. Great Himalayan National Park, India: This national park in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh is rich in both beauty and biodiversity. Located in the western Himalayan Mountains, the park's landscapes include low, wet plains, high, dry deserts, mountain peaks and major rivers. Threatened species, including the endangered snow leopard and red-headed vulture, call this park home. This site is extremely important for biodiversity conservation, according to UNESCO. 
 
 5. Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary, Philippines: The iconic Philippine eagle and the striking white-and-red Philippine cockatoo make their homes in this species-rich sanctuary, which runs north-south along the Pujada Peninsula of the Philippines. At least 11 endangered vertebrates live in the range, along with dozens of species that can be found nowhere else on Earth. 
 
 6. Stevns Klint, Denmark: The striking white chalk cliffs on Denmark's island of Zealand aren't just beautiful. They're paleontological wonders. These cliffs are made of rocks set down at the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Tertiary 65 million years ago. A layer of ash likely marks the spot in time when a meteorite crashed half a world away in Mexico, filling the atmosphere with sun-obscuring dust and probably killing off the dinosaurs. This 9-mile-long (15 km) stretch of cliffs is the longest, best-exposed geological site showing this boundary between eras, according to UNESCO. 
 
 In addition to the six new sites, UNESCO expanded three existing World Heritage sites. These expanded regions include the South China Karst site, which will now be 124 acres (50,000 hectares) larger. This site, on the list since 2007, encompasses a stunning karst landscape in four provinces in southern China. 
 
 The second extension was granted to the Białowieża Forest on the border of Belarus and Poland, which has been a World Heritage Site since 1979. Here, primary forest provides shelter for the European bison, which was once hunted to extinction in the wild. Now reintroduced, the bison is Europe's largest land animal. 
 
 Finally, UNESCO extended the Dutch and German Wadden Sea World Heritage Site, which has been on the list since 2009. This expanse of wetlands and mud flats sits in the southeastern North Sea and is home to hundreds of thousands of birds, as well as seals and other species.

Original article on Live Science. ||||| A vast wetland in Botswana, a prehistoric cave in France and an ancient land formation in the US are among a host of new sites that have been added to the Unesco world heritage list over the last few days, pushing the total number to 1,007. 
 
 The Okavango Delta in Botswana became the 1,000th site to be inscribed on the UN cultural agency's coveted list, which has been active since 1978 and commands strict rules for conservation from host nations. Botswana's unique inland delta, which does not flow into a sea, was described by Unesco as ""an exceptional example of the interaction between climatic, hydrological and biological processes … home to some of the world's most endangered species of large mammal."" 
 
 Its addition comes after almost a decade of advocacy from conservationists and scientific researchers. Speaking to the Guardian, Dr Steve Boyes, scientific director of the Wild Bird Trust who has worked as a wilderness guide in the Okavango, described the news as highly important, but ""long overdue"". 
 
 ""The region has Africa's largest elephant population and is considered a sanctuary for white and black rhinoceros,"" he says. ""The listing will serve as a celebration of this unique wilderness as well as a call to action. All of this will be for nothing if Angola or Namibia decide to develop dams, weirs and mines along the Okavango river – so now begins the much bigger job of preserving the unprotected Angolan catchment. By 2025, we will know whether the Okavango Delta will survive into the distant future.""

 The Grotte Chauvet in the Ardeche, France – home to the earliest known and best preserved figurative drawings in the world and described as an ""exceptional testimony of prehistoric art"" – was also added to the list. The cave, which remained cut off by a rockfall for 20,000 years until its discovery in 1994, contains over 1,000 images dating back to the Aurignacian period (30,000-32,000 years ago). While the closely guarded cave is off-limits to visitors, a replica is due to open in 2015. 
 
 ""Its state of preservation and authenticity is exceptional as a result of its concealment over 23 millennia,"" Unesco said. 
 
 Other inclusions, which consist of both cultural and natural sites, are the vineyard landscape of Piedmont in Italy, which has been a historic site for wine making since the fifth century BC, a series of properties in the city of Bursa, Turkey, that demonstrate the social and economic functions of the Ottoman empire, and the Great Himalayan national park, a stunning yet fragile ecosystem that is home to many endangered species and will now receive close monitoring and observation of its biodiversity.

 Burma made its entry on to the list for the first time when the Pyu ancient cities were awarded heritage status. The trio of brick, walled and moated cities of Halin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra include excavated palace citadels and burial grounds as well as monumental brick Buddhist stupas. 
 
 Another notable addition is the prehistoric earthworks of Poverty Point in Louisiana, USA. The complex of ancient mounds and ridges were created for residential and ceremonial purposes between 3,700 and 3,100BC. The site was praised by Unesco as: ""A remarkable achievement in earthen construction in North America that was not surpassed for at least 2,000 years."" 
 
 The decision, which was welcomed by the US Department of State, comes a year after the US lost its Unesco voting rights along with Israel. The US has had far less influence over Unesco decisions since withdrawing its financial contributions to the organisation in 2011 after the Palestinian government was granted full membership.

 Both Israel and Palestine had sites added to the list this week. The Palestinian village of Battir and its ""cultural landscape"" – currently under threat from the Israeli separation barrier – was added to the list on Friday, while the caves of Maresha and Bet Guvrin in Israel, an area of vast chalk caves in the Judean lowlands, gained world heritage status on Sunday. 
 
 Other sites awarded Unesco world heritage status this year include Qhapaq Nan, a vast Inca road system in Peru, and the fossil rich coastal cliff site of Stevns Kilt in Denmark, which offers ""exceptional evidence of the impact of the Chicxulub meteorite that crashed into the planet about 65 millions years ago."" 
 
 In order to be selected for the list, sites must be considered of outstanding universal value. Cultural sites are judged against a set of criteria such as whether it represents ""a masterpiece of human creative genius"" while the criteria for natural sites includes whether it ""contains superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty"". 
 
 More sites are expected to be added over the next two days as delegates at the world heritage committee work their way through the 40 sites up for consideration for special status during the organisation's 38th session held in Doha, Qatar. ||||| Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. Our cultural and natural heritage are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Places as unique and diverse as the wilds of East Africa’s Serengeti, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Baroque cathedrals of Latin America make up our world’s heritage. What makes the concept of World Heritage exceptional is its universal application. World Heritage sites belong to all the peoples of the world, irrespective of the territory on which they are located. 
 
 The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is embodied in an international treaty called the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972.

52,"LONDON (Reuters) - The parents of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard on Tuesday accused a London hospital of preventing their son from coming home to die, the latest harrowing confrontation in a legal battle that has raised emotions far and wide. 
 
 Great Ormond Street Hospital’s lawyer told the High Court it had moved “heaven and earth” to allow 11-month-old Charlie to go home, but this was impossible for practical reasons. 
 
 The judge said transferring Charlie to a hospice for his last moments -- a move supported by the hospital -- appeared the most realistic option. 
 
 The plight of Charlie, who suffers from a rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness, has been at the center of a bitter dispute between his parents and the hospital. 
 
 The case has triggered a debate on social media and in the press about whether doctors, judges or parents should decide a child’s fate. U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis are among many people who have weighed in with views. 
 
 Staff at Great Ormond Street, a hospital so revered in Britain that it was featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, have received death threats and abuse. 
 
 “Emotions are as high in this case as they could be in any,” said the presiding judge, Nicholas Francis. 
 
 He gave Charlie’s legal team until Wednesday to see if they could find an intensive care team willing to look after Charlie at his home or at a hospice for several days, in accordance with the parents’ wishes. 
 
 Related Coverage UK hospital says baby Charlie Gard's care cannot be provided at home 
 
 “I will make my final decision tomorrow unless something completely new comes up,” he said. A court hearing is scheduled for 1300 GMT on Wednesday. 
 
 Charlie requires a ventilator to breathe and cannot see, hear or swallow. His parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, resigned themselves to letting him die after the most recent set of scans showed his condition had deteriorated to the point no recovery was possible. 
 
 The couple want Charlie to be taken to their home or to the home of a close relative or friend for his last moments until his life support system is switched off. 
 
 Their lawyer, Grant Armstrong, told the London High Court that Great Ormond Street was placing “obstacle after obstacle” in the way of the parents’ wish.

 The hospital’s lawyer, Katie Gollop, denied this. 
 
 ”Nothing could be further from the truth,“ she said. ”The hospital has moved heaven and earth to make this possible for them. 
 
 “DREADFUL CIRCUMSTANCES” 
 
 The court heard that a team of two to three intensive care doctors and four to six intensive care nurses would be required along with the equipment, including a ventilator that could not fit through the front door of Charlie’s home.

 “Charlie is a child who requires highly specialized treatment. His care cannot be simplified. It must be provided in a specialist setting by specialists,” Gollop wrote in a document setting out the hospital’s position for the court. 
 
 She said the hospital had searched “the length and breadth of the country” for an intensive care specialist willing to oversee the care at home, but in vain. This was partly because of the risk of Charlie dying unexpectedly. 
 
 “That would be a disaster,” said Francis, as Charlie’s mother shook her head in disagreement. 
 
 The judge said it appeared the only realistic option was for Charlie to be taken to a hospice where his ventilation tube would be removed shortly afterwards. The parents had wanted four days with Charlie before his death, Gollop said. 
 
 Tuesday’s proceedings were the latest in an agonizing series of court hearings. 
 
 Charlie’s parents had wanted to take him to the United States to undergo an experimental treatment never before tried on anyone with his condition, against the advice of Great Ormond Street doctors. Britain’s courts, backed by the European Court of Human Rights, refused permission, saying it would prolong his suffering without any realistic prospect of helping him. 
 
 The details of Tuesday’s hearing suggested that the relationship between the parents and the hospital had broken down completely. The hospital said the parents had rejected an offer of mediation. 
 
 “Today, palliative care consultants at the hospital have had a lengthy, difficult and (sadly but understandably in the dreadful circumstances) unconstructive meeting with the parents,” the hospital’s legal document said. 
 
 “There remains no agreed plan.” ||||| Charlie Gard: judge to decide on parent's 'last wish' that son can die at home 
 
 A judge will decide on Wednesday whether to grant the “last wish” of Charlie Gard’s parents and allow their son to go home to die. 
 
 
 
 A day after Connie Yates and Chris Gard ended their opposition to the removal of their critically ill baby’s life support system, the couple returned to court on Tuesday to ask that Great Ormond Street hospital’s objections to him being allowed to go home be overruled. 
 
 During another tense hearing, the court heard the objections related to the impracticality of providing the intensive care 11-month-old Charlie is receiving in hospital at home for the “period of days” his parents want him kept alive. 
 
 Timeline Charlie Gard Show Hide Birth Charlie Gard is born a “perfectly healthy” baby at full term and at a “healthy weight”. First symptoms His parents notice he is less able to lift his head and support himself than other babies of a similar age. Doctors discover that he has a rare inherited disease – infantile onset encephalomyopathy mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). 
 
 Hospital Charlie has become lethargic and his breathing is shallow. He is transferred to Great Ormond Street hospital for children in London on 11 October. 
 
 Crowdfunding A crowdfunding page is set up to help finance trial therapy in the United States. Request to high court Great Ormond Street hospital bosses ask the high court judge, Mr Justice Francis, to rule that life-support treatment should stop. First ruling The judge says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment after analysing the case at a hearing in the family division of the high court. 
 
 Appeal Charlie’s parents ask three court of appeal judges to consider the case but less than three weeks later their appeal is dismissed. Supreme court ruling Charlie’s parents lose their fight in the supreme court. European court of human rights The case proceeds to the European court of human rights but a week later it is announced that the European judges have refused to intervene. A Great Ormond Street spokeswoman says there will be “no rush” to change Charlie’s care and says there will be “careful planning and discussion”. More time It is thought that Charlie’s life-support is due to be switched off but his parents say that Great Ormond Street doctors have agreed to “give us a little bit more time” with Charlie. They ask for privacy “while we prepare to say the final goodbye”. Interventions Pope Francis and the US president, Donald Trump, intervene; the former calling for the couple to be allowed to “accompany and treat their child until the end”, saying he has followed the case with “affection and sadness”. Vatican hospital Bambino Gesu, the Vatican’s children’s hospital in Rome, offers to take Charlie in. Return to high court Charlie’s parents return to the high court and ask Mr Justice Francis to carry out fresh analysis of the case. The judge says he will consider any new evidence. Dr Michio Hirano The New York neurology professor who offered to treat Charlie travels to London to examine the little boy, discuss the case with Great Ormond Street doctors and other clinicians and examine fresh scans. New scan The lawyer representing Great Ormond Street says the new scan makes for “sad reading”. Abuse Great Ormond Street chairwoman Mary MacLeod says doctors and nurses have been subjected to abuse in the street and received thousands of threatening messages. Charlie’s parents had previously urged people not to send abuse to Great Ormond Street staff. The end of the legal fight The judge’s decision was initially expected the next day but a lawyer representing Charlie’s parents say they are ending their legal fight over his treatment. 
 
 But Grant Armstrong, the lawyer for Yates and Gard, said he was at pains to understand why the hospital sought to deny them their “last wish”. 
 
 He said: “We struggle with the difficulties which the hospital has placed in the way of the parents’ wish to have a period of time probably a relatively short period of time … before the final act in Charlie’s short life.” 
 
 The infant’s parents abandoned their fight to allow him to be flown to the US for experimental treatment on Monday, having determined it was no longer viable. 
 
 But Armstrong said the couple had been forced to return to the high court in London on Tuesday for the “most difficult, emotional part of the case, [the] circumstances in which Charlie’s passing will be conducted”. 
 
 He claimed that, having agreed in principle in April that it would be possible for Charlie to be flown to the US for treatment, it made no sense for Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh) to say the child could not be taken to the family home in west London or that of one of their relatives – the parents’ two preferred options. 
 
 But Katie Gollop QC, for Gosh, said the flight to the US would have required a specialist intensive care team, which would not be available in a home setting for days on end. 
 
 She said the hospital was willing to fulfil the parental wishes if it was “practical, possible and safe, and in Charlie’s interests so that he comes to no harm”. 
 
 Victoria Butler-Cole, the lawyer instructed by Charlie’s guardian, said the options with respect to him dying at home were withdrawing ventilation within “a matter of hours” or after “a period of days”. 
 
 But she said the latter option was unrealistic because it would require “replicating intensive care outside an intensive care unit”, including a team of three doctors. 
 
 Gosh said it was unable to provide such a team or source one from anywhere in the country. The court heard it was difficult to get medical professionals to provide such care at home because of the risk of complications and the fact that they would not be covered by insurance. 
 
 Speaking after the hearing, Yates pleaded for any paediatric intensive care doctor to come forward to help them. She said: “We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we’ve been through to deny us this.” 
 
 Gollop said Gosh had identified a hospice that was willing to take Charlie, which she said had been difficult given the publicity surrounding the case. But, as Yates wept and held her head in her hands, Armstrong said that although that was preferential to Charlie dying in hospital it would still be seen as “brutality” if he were only there for a few hours. 
 
 Describing it as “the most difficult, painful process for the parents”, Mr Justice Francis urged the parties to resolve their differences outside the courtroom. 
 
 Quick guide Charlie Gard and mitochondrial disease Show Hide What is wrong with Charlie Gard? Charlie has a very rare mitochondrial disease caused by a genetic defect inherited from his parents. The official diagnosis is infantile onset encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, referred to generally as “MDDS”. What is mitochondrial disease? Mitochondria supply energy to the cells in the human body. Mitochondrial failure leads to cellular injury and cell death. When multiple cells fail, the body’s organs are damaged and shut down. These diseases are usually fatal and kill children, although sometimes they don’t show up until adulthood. Where they don’t kill, they cause serious permanent brain damage. What is the damage to Charlie? Charlie is in intensive care at Great Ormond Street hospital in London, the leading children’s hospital in the UK. Life support machines are keeping him alive. The hospital says that he has severe brain damage, cannot move or breathe by himself, is deaf and has epilepsy. It says his heart, liver and kidneys are also affected. His eyelids cannot stay open and because of the weakness of the muscles, his eyes point in different directions and the damage to the brain will not allow his sight to develop. 
 
 As it became apparent there was no prospect of that happening, he said given what he had heard about the need for an intensive care team, were he deciding the issue on the civil standard of proof he would rule out the prospect of Charlie being ventilated for days, whether in a hospice or at home. 
 
 But he went on to say that “given the gravity of the situation and the need to be as human as I can” he would give Charlie’s parents more time to make their case and make a final decision, in the absence of any unexpected developments, on Wednesday afternoon. 
 
 At the end of the often acrimonious hearing, during which Butler-Cole told the court that the latest disagreement was a reflection of what happens when there was “such a fundamental breakdown in communications”, Armstrong, who was in tears in court on Tuesday, angrily confronted Gollop. ||||| The mother of Charlie Gard has returned to the High Court as she and her husband fight for the terminally-ill baby to be allowed home to experience ""tranquility"" before he dies. 
 
 Lawyers told a judge that Connie Yates and Chris Gard want a choice in ""the circumstances in which Charlie's passing will be conducted"" a day after they abandoned legal action over treatment for their son. 
 
 Barrister Grant Armstrong, who represents the couple, said their ""final wish"" is to take Charlie home and indicated that Great Ormond Street Hospital doctors thought such a move would be problematic.","– Charlie Gard's death seems inevitable, but what is yet to be decided is how it will occur, with the infant's parents and London's Great Ormond Street Hospital still at odds. A lawyer says Connie Yates and Chris Gard, who on Monday ended their legal battle to move their 11-month-old son to the US for experimental treatment of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, want to take Charlie home where he can die in ""tranquility"" after ""a short period of time,"" report the Telegraph and Reuters. In court on Tuesday, however, the lawyer cited ""difficulties the hospital has placed in the way of the parents' wish,"" per the Guardian, which notes Charlie had been expected to be taken off life support at the hospital within a few days. A rep countered that the hospital would be willing to grant the parents' request if ""practical, possible, and safe, and in Charlie's interests so that he comes to no harm."" However, she says Charlie's parents have proposed no plan and the hospital is unable to provide a medical team to care for Charlie for the amount of time requested at home; the exact time requested isn't known, but Charlie's parents previously said the boy wasn't expected to live to see his first birthday on Aug. 4. The hospital rep also says Charlie's parents have refused mediation offers ""for reasons Great Ormond Street will never know."" After hearing from both sides in High Court on Tuesday, the presiding judge suggested a settlement would be appropriate.","<pad> Great Ormond Street Hospital’s lawyer told the High Court it had moved “heaven and earth” to allow Charlie to go home, but this was impossible for practical reasons.</s>",0.15306122196845068,0.02264150748479903,0.1224489770704915

 Since his failed attempt at the Republican presidential nomination, Cain has branched out into the media world, showing up regularly on Fox News and making plans to host his own radio show. But clearly, none of those things compare to the genius that is to be ""Cain TV,"" a web network that launches on July 4. Cain is following in the footsteps of Glenn Beck, but, judging from the trailer, GBTV has slightly higher production values than Cain TV.

 Words reading ""Cain TV Is Real American Everything!"" flash across the screen. Then we see, in succession: 
 
 ""COMMENTARY"": This consists of a man mumbling negative things about Sandra Fluke. 
 
 ""STREET SMARTS WITH LEWIS BROWN"": 'I'm Lou from Hollywood,"" Lou from Hollywood says, ""and my mouth don't write checks that my ass can't cash."" He proceeds to bash Hillary Clinton. 
 
 ""DOCUMENTARIES"": Terrorists at the Mexican border! 
 
 A cartoon that shows Ronald Reagan lecturing Barack Obama about the redistribution of wealth. 
 
 ""I WANT YOUR MONEY"": ""a controversial look at government spending."" (This features a cartoon Obama as Uncle Sam.) 
 
 ""A Uniquely American Look At Hypocrisy"": Al Gore. The Kennedys. Noam Chomsky. Michael Moore. All hypocrites. All, presumably, ready for a Cain-esque seeing-to. 
 
 ""FAMILY"": A CGI cartoon about a dinosaur who finds a red white and blue egg in her nest. Out of it hatches a little dinosaur named Tex. ""I love my family, this land and Thanksgiving each fall!"" Tex says. 
 
 ""FUNNY STUFF"": A man named Kivi tells us, ""I'm going to make fun of you. And I'm really funny."" He then dances to banjo music. 
 
 A cartoon where high taxes and regulations make the boss move a company overseas. ""Oh, I hate capitalism,"" one of the workers says. 
 
 A guy asks people on the street if Saddam Hussein is alive. One person thinks he is.

 LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former Republican U.S. presidential candidate Hermain Cain, known for unconventional and conservative views, plans to launch his own TV-style network on the Web, Cain says in a video posted online at CainTV.com. 
 
 CainTV is expected to hit the Internet on Wednesday, July 4, Independence Day holiday in the United States, with a range of programs about politics, economics, border control and street smarts that promise to be “real American.” 
 
 “Hello, I’m Herman Cain. They think we are stupid,” Cain says at the end of the video before the phrase appears: “We are not stupid.” 
 
 “We the people are coming, and we want our power back,” Cain says. 
 
 Cain, 66, a former lobbyist and one-time chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza restaurants in the United States, ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination but suspended his campaign in December last year when he was accused of sexual harassment. 
 
 Still, he remains a favorite of some conservatives who like his off-the-cuff style and policies seeking to reduce government and put power in the hands of people. His most famous plan was his “9-9-9” program to significantly change the U.S. tax code. 
 
 One show promoted in the video, “Street Smarts with Lewis Brown” appears to look at politics from the perspective of an everyday person.

 The big five news organizations have passed on offering former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer a job as an exclusive paid contributor, network sources confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday. 
 
 Since Spicer exited the White House, his representatives have been holding individual conversations about the possibility of President Donald Trump's former flack joining one of the major TV networks, which include CBS News, CNN, Fox News, ABC News and NBC News. 
 
 But ""they won't touch him,"" said a media industry executive familiar with those conversations. 
 
 “The news organizations might use him on roundtables, but [a paid exclusive contributor job] is not happening,” the executive added. 
 
 A number of network insiders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their business relationships said none of the networks were interested in hiring Spicer because of a ""lack of credibility."" 
 
 Representatives of the five news networks all declined to comment. Spicer and Robert Barnett, his representative, also declined to comment. 
 
 CNN had already said it wasn’t interested in him ahead of planned conversations, while Axios reported on Sept. 7 that Fox News would not be offering Spicer a TV contract. Fox News has previously hired the former White House press secretaries Ari Fleischer and Dana Perino. On Tuesday, sources with knowledge of the decisions confirmed that CBS News, ABC News and NBC News also would not offer him an exclusive role. 
 
 A person familiar with Spicer’s ongoing talks said that while conversations had not concluded, network punditry wasn’t the most important measure of success and that Spicer may want more freedom to work for multiple outlets. There are also talks about a nonscripted reality show in the mix, said one person familiar with the situation. 
 
 Meanwhile, there could also be interest in Spicer from other outlets. 
 
 Spicer announced he was leaving the White House in July after news broke that Trump had appointed voluble Wall Street executive Anthony Scaramucci as communications director, and he formally departed in August. (Scaramucci was ousted after just 10 days after his appointment was announced.) One of Spicer’s first moves was to hire Barnett, the veteran Washington politics and media lawyer. 
 
 Spicer already has a role as a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School, and is signed with Worldwide Speakers Group for paid speaking engagements. The company website touts Spicer's ability to discuss ""the people, philosophies and policies that matter most to the citizens of the U.S. and businesses around the world.” 
 
 On Sunday, Spicer surprised the Emmy Awards audience by rolling out on a podium and describing the size of the crowd — a nod to both actress Melissa McCarthy's portrayal of him on ""Saturday Night Live"" and a reference to Spicer’s incorrect contention that the president had attracted the “largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,” in January. 
 
 When asked by The New York Times after the show if he regretted the way he had treated the press and their reporting on inauguration crowd size, he responded, “Of course I do, absolutely.” 
 
 Spicer reportedly turned down an invitation to compete on ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars” in August. ||||| Sean Spicer and Chelsea Manning are headed back to school. Sort of. 
 
 Mr. Spicer, President Trump’s former White House press secretary, and Ms. Manning, a former United States soldier who served seven years in prison for leaking classified information, were named visiting fellows at the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday. 
 
 Needless to say, their politics differ considerably. 
 
 Mr. Spicer, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, objected when President Obama commuted Ms. Manning’s 35-year prison sentence in January. He called it “disappointing” and said ""it sends a very troubling message when it comes to the handling of classified information.” 
 
 Ms. Manning does not appear to be too fond of Mr. Spicer, either. Her appointment drew criticism on Wednesday, and when Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor, said, “I think I’ll forego I.O.P. events this fall,” Ms. Manning replied: “Awesome! Can you ask Sean Spicer to do the same?” ||||| ""I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night - the worst ever,"" President Donald Trump tweeted late Tuesday. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Trump counterpunches Emmy Awards over 'bad' ratings 
 
 President Donald Trump jabbed back at the Emmy Awards' ""bad"" ratings on Twitter on Tuesday night, after the show featured a string of derisive jokes aimed at the White House. 
 
 ""I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night - the worst ever,"" President Trump tweeted late Tuesday, his first comments on the program since it aired Sunday night. 
 
 Story Continued Below 
 
 About 11.4 million viewers tuned in to see the 69th annual Emmy Awards on Sunday, just barely outpacing the 11.3 million that tuned in for 2016, an all-time low for the ceremony. The program ran against a “Sunday Night Football” matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the Atlanta Falcons, which drew in 18.5 million viewers. Overall, the Packers-Falcons game was the highest-rated show of the week; the Emmys finished fourth. 
 
 The awards show, hosted by progressive darling and late-night host Stephen Colbert, saw numerous zingers flung at the president and his administration, most prominently by Colbert himself, who quipped that Trump's presidency might have been avoided had he won an Emmy for his prior work on ""Celebrity Apprentice."" 
 
 ""Why didn’t you give him an Emmy?"" Colbert asked the star-studded crowd. ""I tell you this, if he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn’t have run for president. So in a way this is all your fault.""

 Sunday's iteration of the awards ceremony was also notable for giving several politically oriented TV programs, like the presidential comedy ""Veep"" and the dyspotic ""Handmaid's Tale,"" top honors, moves widely seen as emblematic of a tense political climate. Alec Baldwin, meanwhile, notched the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy for his imitations of Trump on ""Saturday Night Live"" — another program the president has mocked. 
 
 Trump has repeatedly trashed the Emmys in the past. In 2014, Trump panned then-host Seth Meyers of NBC, whose performance he deemed ""terrible,"" adding on Twitter: ""Host Seth Meyers bombed!""

 The show also saw a return to the spotlight for former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer, who rolled out on a podium and mocked his now-infamous first outing at the press podium where he disputed graphic evidence disproving the administration's claim to have turned out the ""largest audience"" ever to a presidential inauguration. 
 
 “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” said Spicer, standing behind the lectern Melissa McCarthy used during her impersonations of him on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” “Both in person and around the world.” 
 
 The president also appeared to praise his political base for being smarter that those tuning into Sunday's broadcast. 
 
 ""Smartest people of them all are the 'DEPLORABLES,'"" Trump added on Tuesday. ||||| Stephen Colbert had the idea to invite Sean Spicer up on stage at the Emmys on Sunday night. He and his producers knew there would be blowback. And there's been a whole lot. 
 
 But Colbert thought it would be funny and surprising, and that's what mattered most. 
 
 Spicer scored points for comedy but sparked a raging debate: Should Colbert and the Emmys have given Spicer a platform to rehabilitate an image so badly tarnished by his brief stint working as President Trump's spokesman? 
 
 Was Spicer ""in on the joke?"" Was he essentially admitting to lying to the American people from behind the White House podium? 
 
 As the debate went on late Sunday night, Colbert was celebrating his first gig hosting the Emmys at a late-night party in Los Angeles. Spicer was there too, taking selfies with celebrities and gawkers. He seemed to revel in the attention.

 Spicer resigned from his job as White House press secretary in July and formally left the administration in August. Now he is hitting the speaker circuit, landing consulting gigs and looking for a potential TV commentator job. He will be a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics this fall. 
 
 Many Democrats and some anti-Trump Republicans are offended that Spicer -- who peddled misinformation on behalf of his boss -- is being embraced by institutions like Harvard. 
 
 ""Harvard and the Emmys based on 7 months lying in the WH,"" former Obama foreign policy adviser Ben Rhodes tweeted. ""America is not exactly a meritocracy and false equivalence trumps reality."" 
 
 Some might see his Emmys appearance as an audition -- similar to his sit-down with Jimmy Kimmel on ABC last week. 
 
 He stood behind a faux podium and told Colbert, ""This will be the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period -- both in person and around the world,"" poking fun at his false assertion about crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. 
 
 Spicer's insistence that Trump had a record crowd, despite photographic evidence to the contrary, was the first of many incidents that eroded Spicer's credibility and made him into a punchline on ""SNL."" 
 
 His ""SNL"" impersonator, Melissa McCarthy, was in the audience during Sunday night's bit, furthering the idea that Spicer was winking at his reputation. 
 
 The Emmys surprise came together just a few days before Sunday's telecast. Colbert wondered aloud if Spicer might play along, and one of his ""Late Show"" producers then pitched it, according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the skit. 
 
 Spicer was already in Los Angeles for Kimmel's show last Wednesday. He briefly flew back east, to his home near Washington, then returned to Los Angeles for a secret dress rehearsal before the broadcast. 
 
 The auditorium was almost entirely emptied before Spicer practiced his lines, the source said, so that his participation wouldn't leak ahead of time. 
 
 The reveal went off without a hitch. From the live broadcast, it looked like the auditorium full of mostly liberal Hollywood celebrities lapped it up. There were laughs and lots of shocked faces. 
 
 Within minutes, however, a wave of criticism crested on social media. Journalists, activists and celebrities said they didn't think it was funny to treat Spicer's mendacious behavior like a throwaway laugh line. 
 
 The actor Zach Braff tweeted: ""I'm not ready to laugh 'with' Sean Spicer. I think he is an evil, opportunistic liar that hurt our country."" 
 
 The MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell commented that the Emmys ""helped Spicer pump up his 'lecture' fees, which is all that matters to him now."" 
 
 While many of the objections came from liberals, some conservatives also made arguments against the skit. 
 
 ""I know people who were offered opportunities to lie for Donald Trump and quietly declined. Harvard & The Emmys calling the wrong folks,"" former Jeb Bush spokesman Tim Miller tweeted. 
 
 Among the counter-arguments: It was just a joke. And besides, wasn't Spicer actually admitting to his and Trump's dishonesty through comedy? 
 
 Colbert is an outspoken opponent of President Trump, and he doesn't fret about the perception that he's ""normalizing"" Spicer. ""Donald Trump normalized Spicer,"" a source involved in the production said. 
 
 Spicer himself told The Hollywood Reporter that he hadn't considered the criticism his appearance might get. ""I was more worried about the logistical reactions,"" he told the magazine after the show. ""I've never wheeled a podium before. The one I'm used to is pretty stationary."" 
 
 Both sources who spoke with CNN on Monday morning marveled at the way Spicer was mobbed by Emmys attendees both at the awards show and at the parties afterward. 
 
 ""He could barely eat at the Governor's Ball, he was so popular,"" one of the sources said. 
 
 President Trump went from the entertainment world -- a hit show on NBC -- to politics. Now Spicer, a longtime spokesman for the Republican National Committee, is going in the other direction. 
 
 The Hollywood Reporter's Chris Gardner described Spicer in the auditorium lobby during the show, ""posing for pics, drinking beer, soaking up all attention after onstage appearance.""","– The Emmys helped Sean Spicer ""rebrand,"" according to CNN—but apparently not enough. The five major news networks have passed on the opportunity to have the former White House press secretary as an exclusive paid contributor, reports NBC News. Spicer's representatives had brought the proposal to CBS News, CNN, Fox News, ABC News, and NBC News, but none were receptive, NBC reports, citing insiders who referred to Spicer's ""lack of credibility."" That doesn't mean Spicer won't be gracing your TV screens shortly. Insiders tell NBC that major networks may be willing to host him, just not exclusively. There might also be a Spicer reality show in the works, one source says. Spicer has already signed with Worldwide Speakers Group to manage his paid speaking engagements. He also has a gig as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, the New York Times previously reported. But even Harvard is taking flak. ""I know people who were offered opportunities to lie for Donald Trump and quietly declined. Harvard & The Emmys calling the wrong folks,"" Tim Miller, a former Jeb Bush spokesman, tweeted, per CNN. President Trump, meanwhile, took to Twitter late Tuesday to bash the Emmy ratings, which he called ""the worst ever,"" reports Politico. The show drew 11.4 million viewers, slightly more than the all-time low of 11.3 million in 2016.","<pad> – The big five news organizations have passed on Sean Spicer's offer of a paid contributor job, NBC News reports.

 When Micheal Brown was in elementary school, he watched his mom earn a college degree that expanded her options and launched her career. Now, the Lamar High School senior is ready for college himself — and thanks to her example and a 4.68 GPA, he has more options than he ever imagined. 
 
 Brown, a 17-year-old from Houston’s Third Ward, applied to 20 colleges and universities, including four Ivy League schools. He’s been accepted by every one, with a full ride to each and more than $260,000 in scholarships. 
 
 “It’s surprising I was accepted to all of them,” Brown said Sunday, a few days after the last of the acceptance emails rolled in. But his principal and counselors are not surprised at all.

 Beyond the sky-high GPA, Brown is involved in a long list of extracurricular activities, including debate. He volunteers. And the future political science major is politically involved — most recently, he worked on Mayor Sylvester Turner’s election campaign. 
 
 Brown hasn’t made a final decision yet, but he has narrowed his list to seven schools. “In no particular order,” they are: Northwestern, Georgetown, Princeton, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and Stanford. 
 
 Every time a message from a college popped up, Brown said, “I got nervous, because I don’t think anyone ever wants to be rejected.”

 But every time, the schools said yes — from Stanford to Princeton, Amherst to Vanderbilt, Johns Hopkins to the University of Texas at Austin. 
 
 It’s not privilege or money that put Brown on the radar of so many selective schools. 
 
 “If you look strictly at statistics and demographics, then the cards were stacked against him,” said Lamar principal James McSwain. The teen’s success is an example, he said, of what can happen “when the forces line up the right way” — when kids are given opportunity, support and good direction. 
 
 The Houston ISD student has benefited from several college prep programs, including EMERGE, which started in HISD and has now spread to Spring and Spring Branch ISDs. EMERGE offers workshops, guidance, college visits and test prep to help kids from underserved communities find their way to some of the best schools in the country. 
 
 Low-income kids have trouble finding their own way to top colleges, said EMERGE founder Rick Cruz. “The kids have a drive — they have the desire — but they don’t necessarily know how to access these types of opportunities.” 
 
 Brown says he got serious about college toward the end of his ninth-grade year. 
 
 “I got very serious about finding ways to get extra-involved in my community and be prepared for college admissions when I got older,” he said. He “fell in love” with debate his sophomore year, got involved in political activism — it was simply a matter of “finding what I enjoy doing and doing those things well.” 
 
 Norman Clark II, an EMERGE academic program director, started working with Brown in his junior year. From the beginning, he saw a focused, smart student with a strong sense of who he was and where he wanted to go. 
 
 “He was already on that top-tier track,” Clark said. “But this program sort of helped to expedite the process.” 
 
 Brown gives his mom, Berthinia Rutledge-Brown, much of the credit for his success. 
 
 “After she got divorced, she decided she needed to get a better job,” he said. Rutledge-Brown enrolled at Houston Community College and worked hard to become a licensed counselor when Brown was 8 or 9 years old. 
 
 “That’s the first time I understood what going to college might look like,” he said. “And seeing how important it was to my mom was important to me. I don’t even think she really knew that I saw, that it had an impact on me — but it did.” 
 
 She’s still showing him how to strive, Brown said; she now works two jobs as a chemical dependency counselor. 
 
 “The best lesson she taught me was through her actions and her working hard and dedicating herself — just doing what she tells me I should do.” 
 
 Brown is not the first area teen to excel at college admissions. Just last year, Alief ISD student Amina Mabizari was accepted by seven of the Ivy League’s eight schools. 
 
 McSwain said these stories are extreme examples of how students across the area are “making something of themselves” and finding opportunity. 
 
 “Education is the great equalizer in this country,” he said. “It enables you to move up and down socially. Education enables you to become something that maybe you never dreamed you could become.” 
 
 Brown predicts that his final college decision will be between Harvard and Stanford. He’ll visit both campuses and make a decision by the May 1 deadline. But Clark, the EMERGE program director, doesn’t want him to rush. 
 
 “He could throw a dart at any of the schools and he’s going to be just fine, so there’s no pressure coming from me,” Clark said. “He has a track record of making great decisions. Now it’s up to Micheal.” ||||| (CNN) Micheal Brown stared at the acceptance letter in front of him: It said yes. 
 
 So did the next one. And the one after that. 
 
 The 17-year-old from Houston applied to 20 of the best universities in the US. He was admitted to every single one with a full ride and $260,000 in additional scholarship offers. 
 
 ""It's something I'm proud of because I see my hard work paying off, determination paying off, sacrifices paying off,"" the student told CNN. 
 
 Of those 20, he listed his top eight choices as: Harvard, Princeton, Northwestern, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, Georgetown and Vanderbilt. 
 
 Currently a senior at Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Micheal has been heavily involved in his school's debate team, mock trial and student government for years. He has also volunteered for political campaigns, citing his interest to ""the moment I saw Barack Obama get elected."" 
 
 He is set on majoring in political science, but is also considering a second degree in economics. 
 
 The first letter 
 
 When he received his first acceptance in December, he chose to do it at a friend's house to relieve the pressure of being around his whole family. 
 
 ""My family had high expectations and maybe didn't realize how competitive the process is,"" he said. 
 
 But he still invited his biggest supporter to come along -- his mom. 
 
 Berthinia Rutledge-Brown filmed as Micheal stood in shock by the computer while his friends excitedly rallied around him. 
 
 Stanford, of course, said yes. 
 
 ""After sixth grade, Mike was in control of his education,"" recalled the proud mom. ""He was focused, he knew what he wanted and he made his own decisions."" 
 
 A mother's dedication 
 
 Rutledge-Brown lost three babies before becoming pregnant with Micheal. Once she finally had a son, she poured all of her energy into giving him the very best that she possibly could. 
 
 He only received one B during his entire academic career, which she said was very difficult for the goal-getter. 
 
 On March 28, Micheal opened the last four admissions decisions that would mark his 20-school streak. 
 
 His mom, who works two jobs as a licensed chemical dependency counselor, took the afternoon off to be with him. 
 
 They are both still in shock about the college and scholarship offers. 
 
 Urging others to dream big 
 
 But he didn't want to talk about his own accomplishments alone. 
 
 ""For me, it's important to highlight that I'm not the only student of color who is achieving,"" the teenager noted. 
 
 Micheal, far right, stands with friends Eric Muthondu and Sammantha Garcia during the Subiendo Academy at University of Texas Austin. All three are first-generation college students that have been accepted to Harvard. 
 
 He has met countless friends through organizations like QuestBridge Emerge Fellowship and Breakthrough Collaborative , which match students from low-income communities with higher education opportunities. 
 
 In fact, Micheal has at least one friend at every single Ivy League school thanks to these initiatives. He stressed the importance of using his platform to show other kids that they can dream big, too. 
 
 ""I want people to be informed and get access to these same programs,"" he said. 
 
 The high achiever will spend the next 30 days touring additional schools before he makes his final choice on May 1. 
 
 And he's not taking a break until the fall. 
 
 This summer, he'll spend two weeks traveling around cities that have historically fought for racial justice as part of Rustic Pathways' ""Race in America"" program.

 “I cried because I realized that there was a chance that my child would get the education he deserves — the one I could not afford to pay for,” she said. 
 
 Her son, it turns out, has several options — and they will all be free. 
 
 Last week Ms. Rutledge-Brown’s son, Micheal Brown, opened the last of his big envelopes, and put an exclamation point at the end of an impressive streak: Mr. Brown, 17, got into all 20 highly selective colleges he applied to, all of which offered him a full ride through a combination of merit- and financial-based scholarships and grants.

58,"Animals are endowed with the capacity to repair injuries. In this study, we found that, upon amputation, the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita rearranges existing body parts and recovers radial symmetry within a few days. This unique strategy of self-repair, which we call symmetrization, requires mechanical forces generated by the muscle-based propulsion machinery. We observed a similar strategy in a number of other jellyfish species. This finding may contribute to understanding the evolutionary pressures governing biological self-repair strategies. Beyond biology, this finding may inspire a mechanically driven, self-organizing machinery that recovers essential geometry without regenerating precise forms. 
 
 Abstract 
 
 What happens when an animal is injured and loses important structures? Some animals simply heal the wound, whereas others are able to regenerate lost parts. In this study, we report a previously unidentified strategy of self-repair, where moon jellyfish respond to injuries by reorganizing existing parts, and rebuilding essential body symmetry, without regenerating what is lost. Specifically, in response to arm amputation, the young jellyfish of Aurelia aurita rearrange their remaining arms, recenter their manubria, and rebuild their muscular networks, all completed within 12 hours to 4 days. We call this process symmetrization. We find that symmetrization is not driven by external cues, cell proliferation, cell death, and proceeded even when foreign arms were grafted on. Instead, we find that forces generated by the muscular network are essential. Inhibiting pulsation using muscle relaxants completely, and reversibly, blocked symmetrization. Furthermore, we observed that decreasing pulse frequency using muscle relaxants slowed symmetrization, whereas increasing pulse frequency by lowering the magnesium concentration in seawater accelerated symmetrization. A mathematical model that describes the compressive forces from the muscle contraction, within the context of the elastic response from the mesoglea and the ephyra geometry, can recapitulate the recovery of global symmetry. Thus, self-repair in Aurelia proceeds through the reorganization of existing parts, and is driven by forces generated by its own propulsion machinery. We find evidence for symmetrization across species of jellyfish (Chrysaora pacifica, Mastigias sp., and Cotylorhiza tuberculata). ||||| View Images Moon jellyfish (pictured at the Vancouver Aquarium) can restore their symmetry within four days.

 In the spring of 2013, biologist Michael Abrams had cut two arms off a young jellyfish when he witnessed something he'd never seen before. 
 
 ""He started yelling... 'You won't believe this, you've got to come here and see what's happening,'"" recalls his Ph.D. advisor Lea Goentoro , a biologist at Caltech in Pasadena. 
 
 The team expected that Abrams' moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) had regrown its limbs, since many other marine invertebrates —including the polyp stage of moon jellyfish—regenerate themselves this way. (See "" Pictures: 5 Animals That Regrow Body Parts ."") 
 
 Instead, the moon jelly had rearranged its six remaining arms until they were evenly placed around the body. Muscles in the jellyfish's body had pushed and pulled on the remaining arms until they were once again evenly spaced. Being symmetrical is crucial for moon jellyfish movement. 
 
 The scientists had stumbled upon a phenomenon completely new to science, which they call ""symmetrization."" Because jellyfish often suffer from injuries—sometimes inflicted by unsuccessful predators—symmetrization is an important method to heal themselves. 
 
 ""This is an amazing study and a fantastic piece of detective work,"" says Sara Lindsay , a marine biologist at the University of Maine, who was not involved with the study. 
 
 Flexing Muscles 
 
 Goentoro and colleagues could have easily missed their discovery: They had originally set out to study limb repair in Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the immortal jellyfish . While they waited for specimens to arrive, the scientists practiced their experimental techniques on the much more common moon jelly. 
 
 After observing the jellyfish putting themselves back together, ""I repeated the experiments several times because I thought I might have made a mistake,"" Abrams says. (See jellyfish pictures from the National Geographic archives .)

 Once he had reassured himself that the jellyfish really was rearranging its arms to restore symmetry—a process which takes between 12 hours to 4 days—Abrams and his team had to figure out how the animal manages such a feat. 
 
 After several false starts, the researchers focused on the jellyfish's musculature. Giving the moon jellies a muscle relaxant made them unable to complete the symmetrization process. On the other hand, when the team increased the muscular pulses of the juvenile jellyfish, the process occurred faster than usual. 
 
 This suggests that the muscles push against each other to get the arms as widely spaced as possible. 
 
 ""It's like squeezing one side of a stress ball and you get a protrusion on the other side,"" says Goentoro, whose study appeared June 15 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
 
 He started yelling... 'You won't believe this, you've got to come here and see what's happening.' Lea Goentoro, Caltech biologist 
 
 Back on Track 
 
 Restoring symmetry is crucial to the marine animals: Asymmetrical jellyfish have difficulties propelling themselves through the water and feeding properly. A jellyfish can lose a limb due to predators.

 It's like a car: Remove one wheel and you won't be able to drive it. But if you shift the remaining wheel from the side of the vehicle into the center, the car will once again be able to move about, the researchers say. 
 
 ""This isn't replacing lost parts, it's replacing their function. That's pretty cool,"" Lindsay says. 
 
 Goentoro adds that understanding the newly discovered phenomenon could provide new insight for scientists studying regenerative medicine. (Related: ""Will We Ever Regenerate Limbs?"") 
 
 ""We hope it will inspire new technology for biomaterials—not by regenerating what was lost, but by restoring function,"" she says.","– When Caltech biologist Michael Abrams cut two arms off a young jellyfish in 2013, he figured it would do what many marine invertebrates do—grow new ones. But no. ""[Abrams] started yelling... 'You won't believe this, you've got to come here and see what's happening,'"" his PhD adviser Lea Goentoro tells National Geographic. Reporting this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Abrams says he watched the jellyfish, which relies on being symmetrical to move about, not regenerate the missing arms but rather rearrange its remaining six limbs so that they were symmetrical again. The phenomenon, dubbed symmetrization, has never before been observed in nature, and Abrams was floored. The jellyfish was using its own muscles to push and pull on its remaining six arms to space them out evenly again. (They confirmed this by observing that muscle relaxants made the jellies unable to rearrange their arms, while increasing muscular pulses allowed them to rearrange their arms faster.) And the discovery was accidental; Abrams and his team had only been cutting into the common moon jellyfish to practice for their future study on what are called immortal jellyfish, which had yet to arrive in the lab. They've since observed symmetrization in moon jellies many times, and it takes anywhere from 12 hours to four days to complete.

 WASHINGTON — Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who provided journalists a trove of classified documents, retained a well-known Washington defense lawyer last summer in hopes of reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors that would allow him to return to the United States and spare him significant prison time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The lawyer, according to people familiar with the investigation, is Plato Cacheris, who has represented defendants in some of the highest-profile cases involving Espionage Act charges, including the convicted spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen and the convicted leaker Lawrence Franklin. 
 
 But nearly a year after Mr. Cacheris became involved, no agreement appears imminent, and government officials said the negotiations remained at an early stage. 
 
 The officials and others who discussed the case and Mr. Cacheris’s involvement in it spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the talks. 
 
 Mr. Snowden, who now lives in Moscow, where he received temporary asylum, was charged last year with multiple violations of the Espionage Act. He faces up to 30 years in prison, and prosecutors could easily add more counts. 
 
 In a phone call, Mr. Cacheris said only: “It’s not something that I want to discuss, so I have no comment.” 
 
 Mr. Snowden’s revelations about the breadth and intrusiveness of the N.S.A.’s surveillance prompted the first major reconsideration of the government’s surveillance powers since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. President Obama has said he wants to stop the N.S.A.’s collection of every American’s phone records, a program that was the subject of the first news article based on Mr. Snowden’s documents. But Mr. Obama and other administration officials have said Mr. Snowden should return to the United States to face prosecution. 
 
 Mr. Snowden has said that he wants to live somewhere other than Russia, but that American diplomatic pressure is preventing him from traveling or obtaining asylum elsewhere. Still, as long as he can live indefinitely under asylum in Russia, he appears unlikely to strike a deal that would require a lengthy prison sentence. 
 
 “Snowden is interested in returning home,” said Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who also represents Mr. Snowden. “He is and always has been on America’s side. He would cooperate in extraordinary ways in the right circumstances. But he does not believe that the ‘felon’ label is the right word for someone whose act of conscience has revitalized democratic oversight of the intelligence community and is leading to historic reforms.” 
 
 Prosecutors have signaled no interest in giving Mr. Snowden credit for the surveillance debate he started. 
 
 “He is accused of leaking classified information, and there is no question his actions have inflicted serious harms on our national security,” said Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman. He said Mr. Snowden was not a whistle-blower. 
 
 Any deal could depend on what information Mr. Snowden could give in return.

 In December, Richard Ledgett, who was then the National Security Agency official leading the response to the leaks and has since become the agency’s deputy director, floated the idea of a deal in which Mr. Snowden would receive leniency in exchange for returning documents in his possession that he had not disclosed. 
 
 “I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high,” he said. “It would be more than just an assertion on his part.” 
 
 It is not clear whether Mr. Ledgett was suggesting an outcome in which Mr. Snowden persuaded journalists to destroy or return the documents, or whether the government believed Mr. Snowden had kept back documents to use as leverage. 
 
 Mr. Snowden has repeatedly said he did not bring any documents to Russia. He recently told Vanity Fair that there was no “doomsday cache” in his possession, saying, “Who would set up a system that incentivizes others to kill them?” 
 
 Even if he has no documents to return, Mr. Snowden could also help the N.S.A. by providing an accounting of what he took. Despite government claims that Mr. Snowden may have taken 1.7 million documents, Mr. Snowden also told Vanity Fair that figure is “a scare number based on an intentionally crude metric: everything that I ever digitally interacted with in my career.” 
 
 Mr. Ledgett confirmed to Vanity Fair that the N.S.A. did not know what he had taken. 
 
 Some leaks cases have ended with charges less than a felony, and Mr. Wizner’s remarks suggest that Mr. Snowden wants something similar. Thomas Drake, a former N.S.A. executive accused of leaking about waste and mismanagement to The Baltimore Sun, was charged under the Espionage Act with mishandling classified documents. He settled his case in 2011 for a misdemeanor guilty plea and served no prison time. 
 
 Several other leak cases under the Obama administration have resulted in deals for roughly two or three years in prison. At the far end of the spectrum, Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, who leaked documents to WikiLeaks, was sentenced by a military court last year to 35 years in prison. 
 
 Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and a Columbia University law professor, said the first step toward a deal is hiring someone like Mr. Cacheris — “a lawyer whom the government can trust and has familiarity with.” 
 
 Mr. Cacheris previously represented Mr. Franklin, a Pentagon analyst who was prosecuted under the administration of George W. Bush for leaking classified information about Iran to pro-Israel lobbyists, who in turn were accused of passing it to journalists. 
 
 Mr. Franklin pleaded guilty in 2005 and was initially sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison. In 2009, a judge reduced the sentence to 10 months of community confinement. 
 
 In 2001, Mr. Cacheris represented Mr. Hanssen, an F.B.I. agent charged with spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. He negotiated a plea deal for a life sentence, sparing Mr. Hanssen the death penalty and allowing his wife to collect part of his pension. 
 
 In 1994, Mr. Cacheris represented Mr. Ames, a Central Intelligence Agency officer charged with being a Russian agent. Mr. Cacheris negotiated a deal for a life sentence for Mr. Ames and a lighter sentence for Mr. Ames's wife for aiding his spying. 
 
 But Mr. Snowden’s negotiations will face steep hurdles, Mr. Richman said, because even if he can offer something, the government will want a punishment that deters future leakers. 
 
 “If there isn’t a deal,” Mr. Richman said, “it’s an unfortunate but relatively stable thing for him to be in Russia for the rest of his life with an American indictment standing against him.” ||||| According to The New York Times, last summer, as Edward Snowden maneuvered around the globe seeking asylum, the former NSA contractor retained a lawyer famous for handling cases involving the Espionage Act. The lawyer, Plato Cacheris, has been working on a plea deal that would allow Snowden to return stateside, but those talks are still in a very early stage. 
 
 Cacheris would not comment to the Times about the case, but Ben Wizner, a lawyer for the ACLU also representing Snowden said, “He would cooperate in extraordinary ways in the right circumstances. But he does not believe that the ‘felon’ label is the right word for someone whose act of conscience has revitalized democratic oversight of the intelligence community and is leading to historic reforms.” 
 
 Among Cacheris’s past clients is Robert Hanssen, the FBI agent who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia in 2001.

60,"Anthony Bosch will reveal motives of Alex Rodriguez and the extent of their relationship in a '60 Minutes' interview on Sunday. 
 
 Desperate to regain the lofty status he once held as the game’s best player, Alex Rodriguez turned to a shady Miami drug dealer in 2010 and the two began a doping program that would include clandestine meetings, complicated regimens and injections of steroids, insulin and supplements, and ultimately, a historic suspension from the game he sought to rule. 
 
 The CBS news program “60 Minutes” will air the results of its nine-month investigation into the Biogenesis doping scandal Sunday night, including interviews with the chief witness against Rodriguez, Anthony Bosch, and MLB’s chief operating officer, Rob Manfred. 
 
 Among the bombshell revelations in the report is an exchange between Bosch and reporter Scott Pelley in which Bosch helps shed light on the motives of the player once considered a lock for Cooperstown and a challenger to the game’s most hallowed statistic, the all-time home run record of 762, currently owned by Barry Bonds. 
 
 BOSCH: “Alex cared. Alex wanted to know. He would study the product. He would study the substances. He would study the dosages, because he wanted to achieve all his human performance or in this case, sports performance, objectives. And the most important one was the 800 home run club.” 
 
 PELLEY: “The 800 home run club?” 
 
 BOSCH: “Which was only going to have one member. Alex Rodriguez.” 
 
 Robert Sabo/New York Daily News 'Alex cared,' Bosch tells reporter Scott Pelley during the segment. 'He would study the product. He would study the substances.' 
 
 The “60 Minutes” report will also delve into the relationship between Rodriguez and Bosch, whose validation of as many as 500 Blackberry messages between the men was the linchpin of MLB’s case and a large basis of arbitrator Fredric Horowitz’s ruling. Bosch knew Rodriguez’s proclivities, his habits, his behavior, his desire to win — and not get caught. 
 
 The Daily News has also obtained text messages that describe a secretive Rodriguez and an accommodating Bosch, who often delivered the substances to Rodriguez at his home or his hotel. 
 
 “Try to use service elevators. Careful. Tons of eyes,” Rodriguez told Bosch in one Blackberry BBM message the day before he hit his 23rd grand slam, tying Lou Gehrig’s record in June 2012 in Atlanta. 
 
 In a spring training game in April 2012, in which he drove in three runs, A-Rod texted Bosch with what they both appeared to believe was good news. 
 
 A-ROD: “Really good. Explosive.” 
 
 ERIK S. LESSER/EPA Bosch says that Rodriguez's most important objective was 'the 800 home run club... which was only going to have one member.' 
 
 BOSCH: “Go with same protocol.” 
 
 The “60 Minutes” segment also reveals how much it cost Rodriguez to do business with Bosch — $12,000 a month, according to the report — and says that Bosch personally injected Rodriguez because “Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject.” 
 
 Pelley and the show’s investigative team also delve into the shadowy underworld surrounding Bosch, including the cast of characters who sold Biogenesis documents to Rodriguez and, ultimately, Major League Baseball. 
 
 In Pelley’s interview, Bosch says Rodriguez’s associates intimidated him to try to prevent him from cooperating with MLB in its investigation, a claim Manfred took seriously. 
 
 “The concerns seemed credible, particularly given that he identified individuals that we had our own concerns about,” Manfred told Pelley, who pressed Manfred about the arrangement MLB made with Bosch to pay his legal fees and provide him with security in exchange for truthful information. “The credibility of any witness is determined by…looking the individual in the eye, listening to the story he tells and then lining it up with the other evidence. And frankly, nobody came in and contradicted what Mr. Bosch said.” ||||| By turning to Tony Bosch to help them make a case against Alex Rodriguez in the Biogenesis investigation, Major League Baseball has become a safe house. Bosch feared for his life, CBS reporter Scott Pelley of ""60 Minutes"" says he was told, because associates of A-Rod threatened Bosch's life after failing to bribe him. So he turned to MLB for protection. 
 
 Bosch also told ""60 Minutes,"" Pelley says, that he developed and administered a PED program, supplying six banned substances to Rodriguez and personally injecting him sometimes because A-Rod feared needles. 
 
 Arbitrator Fredric Horowitz ruled Saturday that Rodriguez must sit out all of the 2014 season, including any postseason the New York Yankees might play. Rodriguez had appealed MLB's original suspension of 211 games, the longest in league history short of a lifetime ban. Rodriguez claims he hasn't used PEDs in a decade. 
 
 A ""lengthy interview"" with Bosch will be broadcast in full Sunday night that gets into ""all of the specifics"" of Bosch's relationship with Rodriguez. Here are the details to expect, Pelley says: 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bosch claims that associates of Rodriguez attempted to bribe him to stay quiet. When that didn't work, he says they attempted to get him out of the country, and when that didn't work, he says, he started getting death threats. 
 
 He was afraid for his life, he tells us in the interview, and that drove him into the arms of Major League Baseball. Baseball told him that they would protect him, would give him security and would defend him legally. 
 
 It's hard to imagine Major League Baseball turning into a witness relocation program, harboring Bosch and ""protecting"" him from associates of A-Rod who allegedly threatened his life. Did the commissioner open up his Milwaukee home to Bosch to keep him out of harm's way from A-Rod's alleged hitmen? It sounds absurd, but what about this story doesn't? Also: If MLB is paying Bosch's way, it's clear that it's OK with him speaking to CBS. Bosch is telling the story it wants told, that A-Rod would do anything to save his hide, to be used against him later if necessary. 
 
 Bosch tells CBS a different story than he did earlier in a previous interview. Bosch denied to ESPN using his Biogenesis clinic to supply PEDs to MLB players, saying media reports about him weren't true. Instead, he claimed to be just a nutritionist. The New Times of Miami broke the story about a year ago that A-Rod and other MLB players got PEDs from Biogenesis, a now-shuttered clinic in South Florida that advertised itself as a chemical fountain of youth. Later, Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers was linked to the clinic, and it resulted in him serving a 65-game suspension at the end of the 2013 season. 
 
 Back in August, ""60 Minutes"" reported that A-Rod had leaked Biogenesis documents implicating Braun and others to the media, including Yahoo Sports. 
 
 Of course, when A-Rod goes to court, he's going to try and make Bosch look like the worst witness in history. It might not be enough to get A-Rod's suspension overturned — and it didn't sway Horowitz much — but Bosch has shown that he can't exactly be trusted. 
 
 And there's still at least one or two pieces of this puzzle missing. Assuming what Bosch says is true, are we to believe A-Rod couldn't conjure enough money to bribe him? Perhaps Bosch believes that MLB can help protect him from prosecution in U.S. courts, but it's hard to figure how MLB would have any sway there. 
 
 Meanwhile, with A-Rod saying he's still going to spring training at Tampa in five weeks— and the Yankees still owing him three more seasons and $61 million — it's anybody's guess what happens next in this soap opera.

 Follow @AnswerDave ||||| 60 Minutes will offer the first look at the details in the doping case of Yankee slugger Alex Rodriguez, including interviews with Major League Baseball's chief witness against him, Anthony Bosch - who says he injected Rodriguez with banned substances - and the league's COO Rob Manfred. Scott Pelley's report will be broadcast Sunday, Jan. 12 (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. 
 
 Rodriguez's 211-game suspension from MLB was lowered by an arbitrator today to 162 games, plus any 2014 playoff games. He has denied using banned drugs as a Yankee and has never tested positive for a banned substance since he joined the New York team. But Bosch's charges, many used in MLB's decision to suspend Rodriguez, include that: 
 
 -He personally delivered banned substances, including testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1 and human growth hormone to Rodriguez at least a dozen times and Rodriguez paid him $12,000 a month in cash. 
 
 -He personally injected Rodriguez because ""Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject."" 
 
 -Rodriguez's mission was to hit 800 home runs and that the Yankee slugger asked him for what he gave MLB superstar Manny Ramirez, a former Bosch client 
 
 -Text messages obtained by 60 Minutes between him and Rodriguez indicate that at times they communicated daily about the substances the slugger took on his ""protocol"" 
 
 -Says Rodriguez associates intimidated him to try to prevent him from cooperating with MLB in its investigation of the Yankee third baseman. 
 
 MLB's Manfred tells Pelley that he believes the threats Bosch says he received could be legitimate. ""The concerns seemed credible, particularly given that he identified individuals that we had our own concerns about."" 
 
 But Bosch once denied he ever gave anyone performance enhancing drugs. Manfred and MLB dropped a lawsuit against him and are now paying for security guards and have agreed to cover his legal fees in return for his cooperation. In Rodriguez's own lawsuit against MLB, he charges that this arrangement is essentially a $5 million bribe, which Manfred says is ""absolutely untrue."" 
 
 Pressed by Pelley that the security and legal fee arrangement is plenty of incentive for Bosch to lie, potentially undermining his credibility, Manfred responds, ""The credibility of any witness is determined by … looking the individual in the eye, listening to the story he tells and then lining it up with the other evidence,"" he tells Pelley. ""And frankly, nobody came in and contradicted what Mr. Bosch said."" 
 
 Rodriguez turned down numerous requests for an interview with 60 Minutes.","– Refusing to accept bribes from Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez is dangerous business, according to Tony Bosch. The man who allegedly supplied Rodriguez with PEDs and cooperated with a Major League Baseball investigation into the matter tells 60 Minutes that he received death threats after Rodriguez associates failed to bribe him, reports CBS News and Yahoo Sports. Among his other allegations: Bosch would sometimes administer the drugs to Rodriguez: ""Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject."" The drugs included human growth hormone and testosterone, which Bosch delivered to A-Rod personally at least a dozen times. Bosch's payment: $12,000 monthly, in cash. A-Rod's goal was to hit 800 home runs and surpass what the New York Daily News calls ""the game's most hallowed statistic,"" Barry Bonds' 762 home runs. Bosch turned to MLB for protection after receiving the death threats. A-Rod's lawsuit against MLB says Bosch's protection program is basically a $5 million bribe, which league COO Rob Manfred calls ""absolutely untrue."" The 60 Minutes segment looks closely at damning text messages exchanged between Bosch and the slugger.

61,"Humane Society Objects To Plan To Kill Geese Living in Two County Parks 
 
 Montgomery Parks says it has tried nonlethal methods, but geese population has continued to grow 
 
 By Aaron Kraut 
 
 Two Canada geese in a Montgomery County park Montgomery Parks 
 
 The Humane Society of the United States is calling on Montgomery Parks not to go forward with a plan to round up and kill as many as 300 geese in a Silver Spring park and at the popular Lake Needwood recreation area in Rockville. 
 
 David Petersen, natural resources specialist with Montgomery Parks, said the department is facing an overpopulation of Canada geese, which damage playing fields and water quality, leave droppings filled with bacteria, and can be aggressive toward park guests—especially in the spring while protecting their nests. 
 
 He said recent counts have found between 80 and 120 of the geese at Martin Luther King Jr. Recreational Park, the 95-acre park in Silver Spring where Parks staff and a contractor will round up geese for transportation to a processing facility starting either late this month or early July. 
 
 The roundup must wait until the geese have begun molting, or losing their flying feathers, Petersen said. The same process will happen at Lake Needwood, where he said counts have found between 20 and 50 geese. 
 
 The program as approved allows for the removal of up to 300 geese, though Petersen said he expects the number of geese to be rounded up and killed to be between 100 and 150. The goose meat from the processing plant will be donated to the Maryland Food Bank. It will be the first time Montgomery Parks has used the method of collecting the birds and taking them to a processing facility. 
 
 “This hasn’t been something that we’re jumping to do,” Petersen said. “The problems at these parks go back years and years. We’ve been doing other management efforts, but again as we’ve seen other entities successfully use this technique, it kind of just surfaced as the next step.” 
 
 Lynsey White Dasher, director of humane wildlife conflict resolution with the Humane Society, said the lethal method for dealing with geese is inhumane and often ineffective. 
 
 “These round up and killing programs for geese are not effective because they simply leave open empty attractable habitat,” Dasher said, “and that habitat will be refilled by geese coming in from nearby areas.” 
 
 She encouraged Montgomery Parks to implement a program of other techniques throughout the year, including egg addling, hiring companies with dogs to chase the geese away and allowing grass and vegetation to grow higher immediately around lakes and ponds. 
 
 Via Montgomery Parks, the two locations where the geese roundups are set to take place. 
 
 Geese are known to prefer lakes and ponds with mowed grass edges, since it allows them to more easily look out for predators during the molting season. That’s part of the reason why geese are known to frequent parks with athletic playing fields and golf courses, Petersen and Dasher said. 
 
 Petersen said Parks has tried those other techniques, including egg addling, in which people paint over goose eggs with corn oil so the eggs can’t hatch. The Humane Society considers that method more humane than rounding up adult geese and killing them. 
 
 He also said the department has repeatedly tried to get park patrons to stop feeding the animals, something else that attracts them to the areas. 
 
 “We do want to recognize that [Montgomery Parks] seems to be making some effort, but we certainly feel they could expand these humane efforts and we would be happy to help them design and implement a humane Canada geese management program,” Dasher said. 
 
 Petersen said Parks expects the roundup program to significantly decrease the geese populations in the two parks, though he left open the possibility the department would have to conduct similar programs in the future. 
 
 “It absolutely reduces the population,” Petersen said. “That’s been shown not only around the region, but around the country. This has been used for decades as a way to reduce the impacts. I don’t foresee the same number or more geese coming back the following season.” 
 
 The operation has approval from Parks Director Michael Riley and a permit required by the federal government. Parks staff and its contractor will use small, temporary fences to round up the geese, which will then be put into crates and transported to the processor, where they will be slaughtered and the meat packaged for the food bank. 
 
 Petersen said the project will cost Parks about $20 per goose. ||||| Montgomery County, Maryland, believes they have an uncommon solution to a bird problem in their county parks. 
 
 Montgomery Parks plans to round up between 100 to 150 geese that have been creating safety issues in the facilities and humanely euthanize them. The animals will be processed and the meat will be donated to the Maryland Food Bank. 
 
 “These geese are year-round residents and create multiple issues for park users and staff. The excessive feces they leave, up to one pound daily, is not only unsightly but causes unsanitary conditions around bodies of water, docks, pathways, athletic fields and lawn areas,” Dave Petersen, Natural Resources Specialist for Montgomery Parks, said in a press release. 
 
 The park service has already tried different, non-lethal methods to get rid of the geese, including a ban on feeding them, habitat manipulation, fencing and repelling devices. Those methods have worked in some parks, but other parks, including the Martin Luther King Jr., Recreational Park and Rock Creek Regional Park, continue to have a problem with too many geese. 
 
 A federally permitted wildlife contractor will do the geese removal. WTOP Radio reported The Humane Society of the United States has voiced its concern over the plans and would prefer the park system exhaust every non-lethal type of management. 
 
 “For us, it’s the first time we’ve used this method, but it is by no means unprecedented in our area,” Peterson told WTOP. ||||| Geese will be humanely euthanized, processed and donated to the Maryland Food Bank. 
 
 SILVER SPRING, MD—Montgomery Parks, part of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission is launching a geese removal project at two park sites, Martin Luther King, Jr. Recreational Park and Rock Creek Regional Park. The project will take place this June and up to 300 geese will be removed and humanely euthanized. The animals will then be processed for human consumption and the meat donated to the Maryland Food Bank. 
 
 “These geese are year-round residents and create multiple issues for park users and staff. The excessive feces they leave, up to one pound daily, is not only unsightly but causes unsanitary conditions around bodies of water, docks, pathways, athletic fields and lawn areas,” said Dave Petersen, Natural Resources Specialist for Montgomery Parks. 
 
 Other negative impacts from the geese include turf damage, shoreline erosion, aggressive and potentially dangerous behavior during nesting season, and public safety hazards on roads. 
 
 The Department of Parks has already implemented a number of measures to reduce negative impacts from geese, including a ban on feeding them, habitat manipulation, exclusion fencing, egg-oiling / addling and repelling devices. While these methods have proven beneficial at some park locations, they have not been sufficient to alleviate the impacts at Martin Luther King, Jr., Recreational Park and Rock Creek Regional Park. 
 
 The geese removal is being conducted by a federally permitted wildlife contractor in cooperation with Montgomery Parks’ Natural Resources Stewardship staff. Similar removal efforts have been conducted on both public and private land throughout the region.

62,"HESPERIA — A tragic accident that claimed a young Hesperia mother and one of her three sons, and left another still missing, has left family members ""devastated"" and ""heartbroken,"" they told the Daily Press on Friday. 
 
 “It's one of those things where you feel like you're telling somebody else's story,” said Natalia Garcia, 19, of Pomona. “You're telling friends and family who are calling what happened and then you sit back and think about how your 1-year-old nephew is freezing.” 
 
 As San Bernardino County Sheriff's’ dive team members continued their search for 2-year-old Noah Abbott until about 2 p.m. Friday, loved ones paid their respects. Noah's mother, Christina Eileen Estrada, 31, of Hesperia, and his brother Jeremiah Robert Abbott, 3, were killed when their red Volkswagen convertible crashed through a fence on Main Street and into the California Aqueduct on Thursday night. 
 
 Candles of all sizes, stuffed animals and bouquet of flowers were placed along the fence where the crash occurred. While some formed a prayer circle as the dive team searched for Noah’s body, others held each other in a long embrace as they grieved. 
 
 Garcia, who is a cousin of the family, told the Daily Press authorities told the family the Volkswagen was traveling west on Main Street but it's still unknown what caused it to crash into the aqueduct. The investigation continues. 
 
 She also described Estrada as a mother who ""loved her kids with all her heart"" and the three children as ""loving boys who loved their momma and loved their daddy."" 
 
 “When they told us they couldn’t resume the search and we had to wait until morning it was hard,” Garcia said. “There was just nothing we could do and we had to let the professionals do their job.” 
 
 Noah’s great-grandmother of Apple Valley, who declined to give her name, said she received a call from Noah’s father, Kevin Abbott, around 10 p.m. Friday night and said she “was heartbroken to hear the news.” 
 
 “My husband and I will stick around here as long as we can and will just be thankful once they recover Noah's body,” she said. “It's really heartbreaking to know that he hasn't been recovered.” 
 
 San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner officials said Estrada was pronounced dead at the scene at 7:47 p.m. after emergency personnel pulled her from the icy water. 
 
 Emergency personnel also pulled Jeremiah from the water and transported him to Desert Valley Hospital. He was pronounced dead in the emergency department at 10:32 p.m., authorities said. 
 
 Noah’s other brother, Elijah Estrada, 10, was taken to Loma Linda University Medical Center, where he is continuing to recover. Witnesses at the scene said they helped rescue the boy after he was ejected from the Volkswagen. 
 
 Elijah was reported to be ""doing well,"" according to his uncle, Steven Abbott. 
 
 ""We're just glad he's doing good and appears to be in good health,"" Abbott told the Daily Press. 
 
 Abbott said the family was ""devastated"" and ""heartbroken,"" but planned to stay at the aqueduct until Noah was found. 
 
 ""Kevin's having a hard time right now,"" Garcia said. ""He's been put in a position where he's now a single father, so we're looking for any support we can get."" 
 
 Garcia said the family has created two GoFundMe accounts, one by herself and one by Abbott, to help the father, Kevin Abbott, who is also an Iraq War veteran. 
 
 ""We're not asking for money, we're asking for support, whatever that may be,” Steven Abbott said. “Even if it's a prayer, we'll take that all day.""

Christina was unfortunately pronounced dead on the scene, and Jeremiah, after two hours of unsuccessful resuscitation, has also unfortunately passed away. With this much loss, our family is not only suffering emotionally but financially. Keven, the husband and father, is an Iraqi veteran who has fallen on hard times and has the burden of planning multiple funerals for the ones he loved most. He has to bury his wife and children, yet still run a household and take care of his other kids. If God puts it in your heart to donate, please know that all is appreciated and words do not explain how much every penny matters. Other ways to help the family include prayers (a lot of them) and even sharing this link so that it may reach far and wide. Thank you so much and may God bless you all!** any questions regarding the fund may be forwarded to nataliagarcia1724@gmail.com

The bodies of Christina Estrada, 31, and another son, Jeremiah, 3, were previously recovered, but Noah remains missing and presumed dead. The family's attention now turns to the lone survivor, Elijah Estrada, 10, who was released from a hospital over the weekend. He had been ejected from the red Volkswagen convertible, and witnesses say they helped pull him from the water, where he had been holding on to flotation buoys. Elijah's uncle, Steven Abbott, tells the Victorville Daily Press that the boy is doing well and appears to be in good health. Relatives kept a vigil at the aqueduct in Hesperia amid a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers, and stuffed animals as police searched for Noah in the water and by air. Authorities ended the search because of unsafe conditions from a strong current and poor visibility. Two GoFundMe accounts (here and here) have been set up to help Kevin Abbott, the husband and father, pay funeral expenses.

 Top scientists from a variety of fields say they are about as certain that global warming is a real, man-made threat as they are that cigarettes kill. 
 
 They are as sure about climate change as they are about the age of the universe. They say they are more certain about climate change than they are that vitamins make you healthy or that dioxin in Superfund sites is dangerous. 
 
 They'll even put a number on how certain they are about climate change. But that number isn't 100 percent. It's 95 percent. 
 
 And for some non-scientists, that's just not good enough. 
 
 There's a mismatch between what scientists say about how certain they are and what the general public thinks the experts mean, experts say. 
 
 That is an issue because this week, scientists from around the world have gathered in Stockholm for a meeting of a U.N. panel on climate change, and they will probably issue a report saying it is ""extremely likely"" _ which they define in footnotes as 95 percent certain _ that humans are mostly to blame for temperatures that have climbed since 1951. 
 
 One climate scientist involved says the panel may even boost it in some places to ""virtually certain"" and 99 percent. 
 
 Some climate-change deniers have looked at 95 percent and scoffed. After all, most people wouldn't get on a plane that had only a 95 percent certainty of landing safely, risk experts say. 
 
 But in science, 95 percent certainty is often considered the gold standard for certainty. 
 
 ""Uncertainty is inherent in every scientific judgment,"" said Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Thomas Burke. ""Will the sun come up in the morning?"" Scientists know the answer is yes, but they can't really say so with 100 percent certainty because there are so many factors out there that are not quite understood or under control. 
 
 George Gray, director of the Center for Risk Science and Public Health at George Washington University, said that demanding absolute proof on things such as climate doesn't make sense. 
 
 ""There's a group of people who seem to think that when scientists say they are uncertain, we shouldn't do anything,"" said Gray, who was chief scientist for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency during the George W. Bush administration. ""That's crazy. We're uncertain and we buy insurance."" 
 
 With the U.N. panel about to weigh in on the effects of greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of oil, coal and gas, The Associated Press asked scientists who specialize in climate, physics, epidemiology, public health, statistics and risk just what in science is more certain than human-caused climate change, what is about the same, and what is less. 
 
 They said gravity is a good example of something more certain than climate change. Climate change ""is not as sure as if you drop a stone it will hit the Earth,"" Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said. ""It's not certain, but it's close."" 
 
 Arizona State University physicist Lawrence Krauss said the 95 percent quoted for climate change is equivalent to the current certainty among physicists that the universe is 13.8 billion years old. 
 
 The president of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, Ralph Cicerone, and more than a dozen other scientists contacted by the AP said the 95 percent certainty regarding climate change is most similar to the confidence scientists have in the decades' worth of evidence that cigarettes are deadly. 
 
 ""What is understood does not violate any mechanism that we understand about cancer,"" while ""statistics confirm what we know about cancer,"" said Cicerone, an atmospheric scientist. Add to that a ""very high consensus"" among scientists about the harm of tobacco, and it sounds similar to the case for climate change, he said. 
 
 But even the best study can be nitpicked because nothing is perfect, and that's the strategy of both tobacco defenders and climate deniers, said Stanton Glantz, a medicine professor at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its tobacco control research center. 
 
 George Washington's Gray said the 95 percent number the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will probably adopt may not be realistic. In general, regardless of the field of research, experts tend to overestimate their confidence in their certainty, he said. Other experts said the 95 percent figure is too low. 
 
 Jeff Severinghaus, a geoscientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said that through the use of radioactive isotopes, scientists are more than 99 percent sure that much of the carbon in the air has human fingerprints on it. And because of basic physics, scientists are 99 percent certain that carbon traps heat in what is called the greenhouse effect. 
 
 But the role of nature and all sorts of other factors bring the number down to 95 percent when you want to say that the majority of the warming is human-caused, he said.

 A landmark report says scientists are 95% certain that humans are the ""dominant cause"" of global warming since the 1950s. 
 
 The report by the UN's climate panel details the physical evidence behind climate change. 
 
 On the ground, in the air, in the oceans, global warming is ""unequivocal"", it explained. 
 
 It adds that a pause in warming over the past 15 years is too short to reflect long-term trends. 
 
 The panel warns that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all aspects of the climate system. 
 
 To contain these changes will require ""substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions"". 
 
 Image caption Projections are based on assumptions about how much greenhouse gases might be released 
 
 After a week of intense negotiations in the Swedish capital, the summary for policymakers on the physical science of global warming has finally been released. 
 
 The first part of an IPCC trilogy, due over the next 12 months, this dense, 36-page document is considered the most comprehensive statement on our understanding of the mechanics of a warming planet. 
 
 It states baldly that, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes in the climate system are ""unprecedented over decades to millennia"".

 Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface, and warmer than any period since 1850, and probably warmer than any time in the past 1,400 years. 
 
 ""Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and that concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,"" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of IPCC working group one, who produced the report. 
 
 Speaking at a news conference in the Swedish capital, Prof Thomas Stocker, another co-chair, said that climate change ""challenges the two primary resources of humans and ecosystems, land and water. In short, it threatens our planet, our only home"". 
 
 Since 1950, the report's authors say, humanity is clearly responsible for more than half of the observed increase in temperatures. 
 
 Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Rajendra Pachauri said he was confident the report would convince the public on global climate change 
 
 But a so-called pause in the increase in temperatures in the period since 1998 is downplayed in the report. The scientists point out that this period began with a very hot El Nino year. 
 
 ""Trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends,"" the report says. 
 
 Prof Stocker, added: ""I'm afraid there is not a lot of public literature that allows us to delve deeper at the required depth of this emerging scientific question. 
 
 ""For example, there are not sufficient observations of the uptake of heat, particularly into the deep ocean, that would be one of the possible mechanisms to explain this warming hiatus."" 
 
 ""Likewise we have insufficient data to adequately assess the forcing over the last 10-15 years to establish a relationship between the causes of the warming."" 
 
 However, the report does alter a key figure from the 2007 study. The temperature range given for a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, called equilibrium climate sensitivity, was 2.0C to 4.5C in that report. 
 
 In the latest document, the range has been changed to 1.5C to 4.5C. The scientists say this reflects improved understanding, better temperature records and new estimates for the factors driving up temperatures. 
 
 What is the IPCC? In its own words, the IPCC is there ""to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts"". The offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate. These are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments. The IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis. 
 
 In the summary for policymakers, the scientists say the rise in ocean waters will proceed at a faster rate than we have experienced over the past 40 years. Global mean sea level rise for 2081−2100, the document says, is projected to be between 26cm (at the low end) and 82cm (at the high end), depending on the greenhouse emissions path this century. 
 
 The scientists say ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for 90% of energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010. 
 
 For the future, the report states that warming is projected to continue under all scenarios. Model simulations indicate that global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to 1850. 
 
 Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, from Imperial College London, told BBC News: ""We are performing a very dangerous experiment with our planet, and I don't want my grandchildren to suffer the consequences of that experiment."" 
 
 Follow Matt on Twitter. ||||| STOCKHOLM — The world’s top climate scientists on Friday formally embraced an upper limit on greenhouse gases for the first time, establishing a target level at which humanity must stop spewing them into the atmosphere or face irreversible climatic changes. They warned that the target is likely to be exceeded in a matter of decades unless steps are taken soon to reduce emissions. 
 
 Unveiling the latest United Nations assessment of climate science, the experts cited a litany of changes that were already under way, warned that they were likely to accelerate and expressed virtual certainty that human activity is the main cause. “Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time,” said Thomas F. Stocker, co-chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations-sponsored group of scientists that produced the report. “In short, it threatens our planet, our only home.” 
 
 The panel, in issuing its most definitive assessment yet of the risks of human-caused warming, hoped to give impetus to international negotiations toward a new climate treaty, which have languished in recent years in a swamp of technical and political disputes. The group made clear that time was not on the planet’s side if emissions continued unchecked. 
 
 “Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,” the report said. “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” 
 
 The new report is a 36-page summary for world leaders of a 900-page report that is to be released next week on the physical science of climate change. That will be followed by additional reports in 2014 on the most likely impacts and on possible steps to limit the damage. A draft of the summary leaked last month, and the final version did not change greatly, though it was edited for clarity. 
 
 Going well beyond its four previous analyses of the emissions problem, the panel endorsed a “carbon budget” for humanity — a limit on the amount of the primary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, that can be produced by industrial activities and the clearing of forests. No more than one trillion metric tons of carbon could be burned and the resulting gases released into the atmosphere, the panel found, if planetary warming is to be kept below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above the level of preindustrial times. That temperature is a target above which scientists believe the most dangerous effects of climate change would begin to occur. 
 
 Just over a half-trillion tons have already been burned since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and at the rate energy consumption is growing, the trillionth ton will be burned sometime around 2040, according to calculations by Myles R. Allen, a scientist at the University of Oxford and one of the authors of the new report. More than three trillion tons of carbon are still left in the ground as fossil fuels. 
 
 Once the trillion-ton budget is exhausted, companies that wanted to keep burning fossil fuels would have to come up with ways to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground. In the United States, the Obama administration is moving forward with rules that would essentially require such technology, which is likely to be costly, for any future coal-burning power plants; the president’s Republican opponents have accused him of waging a “war on coal.” 
 
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a worldwide committee of hundreds of scientists that issues major reports every five or six years, advising governments on the latest knowledge on climate change. 
 
 The group has now issued five major reports since 1990, each of them finding greater certainty that the world is warming and greater likelihood that human activity is the chief cause. The new report finds a 95 to 100 percent chance that most of the warming of recent decades is human-caused, up from the 90 to 100 percent chance cited in the last report, in 2007. 
 
 But the new document also acknowledges that climate science still contains uncertainties, including the likely magnitude of the warming for a given level of emissions, the rate at which the ocean will rise, and the likelihood that plants and animals will be driven to extinction. The scientists emphasized, however, that those uncertainties cut in both directions and the only way to limit the risk is to limit emissions. 
 
 Climate-skeptic organizations assailed the new report as alarmist even before it was published. 
 
 The Heartland Institute, a Chicago organization, issued a document last week saying that any additional global warming would likely be limited to a few tenths of a degree and that this “would not represent a climate crisis.” 
 
 One issue much cited by the climate doubters is the slowdown in global warming that has occurred over the past 15 years. The report acknowledged that it was not fully understood, but said such pauses had occurred in the past and the natural variability of climate was a likely explanation.","– The UN's climate change panel for the first time charted the upper limit of acceptable global carbon emissions today—and we're already halfway to it. Based on an internationally agreed upon goal of keeping temperatures within 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of their pre-industrial levels, humanity can only allow gas from 1 trillion tons of burned carbon to enter the atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its report, according to the New York Times. We're on pace to hit that ceiling in 2040. The much-anticipated report was released this morning following a furious night of editing, but the substance of it hasn't changed much since a draft was released in August.

 SEOUL (Reuters) - Thousands gathered in Pyongyang for the opening of the “Arirang” mass games, an annual spectacle celebrating North Korea’s leaders and history, even as their nation suffers from chronic food shortages and asks other nations for aid. 
 
 Nearly two million died from hunger in the 1990s, and shortages loom again following a severe winter and flooding this year. A U.N. report said in March that more than 6 million people are in urgent need of outside assistance.

65,"Donating breast milk after her son's death, mother helps another baby survive 
 
 Aiding other children can help moms through their grief, some experts say 
 
 She remembers going into another room to pump and weeping as the bottle filled, knowing the milk was no longer for her 7-week-old Phil. Instead, it would go to other babies struggling to survive. Peszat continued to pump for another week and donated that milk, as well as a freezer full of 4-ounce bottles she'd been saving for the son who never came home. 
 
 After Elizabeth Peszat's newborn took his last breath in the neonatal intensive care unit, her breasts swelled with milk despite her grief. 
 
 Elizabeth and Phil Peszat hold a photo of their son, Phil, who died last year when he was 7 weeks old. Elizabeth Peszat donated the breast milk that she continued to pump after his death. (Phil Velasquez, Chicago Tribune) 
 
 ""It was still, in a way, comforting that other babies could use the milk even though Phil couldn't have it anymore,"" said 32-year-old Peszat of Hawthorn Woods, tearing up as she recalled the Feb. 5, 2013, death of her firstborn. 
 
 Lactation after infant loss has historically been a taboo subject in the halls of many hospitals. Medical professionals for so long had little guidance on how to approach that moment when milk comes in as a mother mourns her stillborn, or the pain in continuing to pump when there's no longer a baby to feed. But hospitals in recent years have been folding more lactation support into counseling for bereaved mothers, helping to ease postpartum mourning and adding to the coffers of milk banks around the country. 
 
 Thirty-four bereaved mothers donated milk in this part of the Midwest last year, compared to two in 2006, according to the Indiana Mothers' Milk Bank, which was established in 2005 and covers Illinois and four other states. 
 
 Some grieving moms like Peszat say they find comfort in donating their milk, for it extends their ability to mother after their baby is gone. 
 
 A few days after baby Phil died, Gladys Garcia Limmo of Des Plaines was rushed to the same hospital and gave birth to twin boys at 23 weeks and four days. Elijah James lived only about six hours, dying after an emergency baptism. 
 
 But Levi John, weighing just over a pound, was nourished by breast milk from a feeding tube and grew stronger in the neonatal intensive care unit at Advocate Children's Hospital in Park Ridge. Some of that milk, identified only by numbers on the bottles, came from Peszat. 
 
 Levi John turned 1 Saturday. He weighs more than 15 pounds. 
 
 Limmo, 38, believes the donor milk helped her baby persevere. 
 
 ""I am so thankful for the one who gave the milk,"" she said. 
 
 'A way of bonding' 
 
 Peszat and her husband, Phil, met as counselors at a youth camp in Lake Geneva, Wis., and married about five years ago. 
 
 ""This was definitely the person I wanted to mother my child,"" Phil Peszat remembers thinking as they dated. 
 
 Baby Phil was born Dec. 19, 2012, at 23 weeks and five days' gestation. 
 
 At 1 pound, 7 ounces, he had an arm thinner than his mother's pinkie. His hair was a striking shade of strawberry blond. Relatives said he had his mom's chin. 
 
 Peszat said her first drops of milk brought her joy. She triumphantly brought a bit of thick colostrum to the hospital, to be fed to baby Phil through a nasal tube. 
 
 She remembers the nurses cheered. Breast milk is considered the perfect blend of water and fat and protein and carbohydrates, laced with the antibodies of the mother, in a recipe that mysteriously alters based on the needs of the baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2012 stated unequivocally that all preterm infants should receive only breast milk, either from the mother or pasteurized donor milk. ||||| There are many kinds of women who deserve to be honored on Mother's Day. Many nurture and care for their own children. Some, like Amy Hanson, 30, also helped nourish the children of others. 
 
 Preeclampsia had forced Amy to have an emergency C-section on March 15, 2015, delivering Adalyn Rose ""Addie"" Hanson at 27 weeks and 5 days gestation at Rush University Medical Center. The micropreemie weighed not quite a pound-and-a-half and was immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. For the first days of her daughter's short life, Amy was only able to see her via Facetime. 
 
 So the Chicago mother started pumping, the rhythm of the machine and flow of breast milk connecting mom and baby when no other connection was possible. Amy, who also works as a pharmacist at Rush, had heard of the difficulties of nursing and wasn't sure pumping alone would work. She was a little surprised when her milk came in without a baby present to suckle. 
 
 ""It's still incredible that your body knows and that it happens so soon,"" she said. 
 
 Addie was just 12 inches long with dark hair, her chin and toes resembling those of her father, Jeff Hanson.

 ""Her diaper was the size of a Splenda packet, so small,"" Amy recalled, smiling at the memory of gingerly changing the newborn when they reunited. 
 
 Amy tried to put Addie on her breast when she was about a month old, but she was still too weak and couldn't nurse much. 
 
 So the mother kept pumping, in part to pass along her immunity through the milk, hoping it might make up for the third trimester in the womb her daughter had been denied. 
 
 Every two to three hours, six to eight times a day, Amy kept filling 4-ounce bottles, too focused on her baby's survival to keep track as the leftovers accumulated in a freezer at Rush. 
 
 Addie held on in the NICU for 160 days, a little over five months. 
 
 ""She never turned that corner of getting better,"" Amy said. ""The whole big picture was that she just wasn't meeting the milestones that her lungs needed to meet."" 
 
 On Aug. 23, Amy held Addie for the last time, reciting Psalm 23: ... Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me ... 
 
 ""I read that to her and she passed away,"" Amy said. ""She passed away probably within the hour."" 
 
 Even after the burial at Sts. Peter and Paul Cemetery in Naperville, Amy continued making milk for a few weeks, until it finally tapered off to a trickle. 
 
 So the mother stopped pumping. It was time.

 In the back of her mind, Amy said she always knew she would donate the extra milk if her daughter couldn't come home, believing it would help another baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2012 advocated that preterm infants receive only breast milk from either the mother or pasteurized donor milk, citing protection against infection as well as long-term health benefits. Preterm milk like Amy's is particularly nutritious for those tiniest of patients in the NICU. 
 
 Amy said she was stunned when a lactation consultant revealed just how much she had pumped: First she saw one large crate packed with more than 50 4-ounce bottles. Then she realized there were 21 more crates. She ended up donating 5,000 ounces — almost 40 gallons of milk — enough to feed about 22 preemies for a month, according to nurses at Rush. 
 
 The hospital held a small ceremony at the NICU in February to commemorate the donation as well as to remember Addie. 
 
 The first human milk bank in Illinois, which began pasteurizing in January, has had more than 90 donors so far, said Summer Kelly, executive director of Mothers' Milk Bank of the Western Great Lakes in Elk Grove Village, which serves Illinois and Wisconsin. Nine of them were bereaved mothers, including Amy, whose donation was divided between the new Illinois milk bank and one in Ohio. 
 
 Approaching a grieving mother about milk donation can be a delicate task, said Kelly, a former obstetrics nurse and NICU lactation consultant. But she said most women are grateful for the chance to make that choice, even if they decline to donate or decide to suppress their milk. Many say making this most intimate donation helps them heal. 
 
 ""They just absolutely can't bear the thought of throwing the milk away,"" she said. ""And they want to help other babies, that's very universal among bereaved mothers.""

 Amy and Jeff never took down the pink elephant-themed nursery they'd prepared for Addie. 
 
 At first they were a little afraid to try and have another baby, with a 20 to 40 percent risk of recurring preeclampsia shrouding future pregnancies. But Amy said her fear was eclipsed by the joy of the prospect of motherhood, another chance to hold and feed and care for a child. 
 
 ""I loved being a mom,"" she said, tearing up. 
 
 The Hansons are expecting another baby girl, due July 23. The pregnancy has been healthy with no troubling symptoms. 
 
 They plan to tell her all about her big sister Adalyn Rose, whose milk helped feed so many other babies fighting for survival.

 Twitter @angie_leventis ||||| “I decided to donate Bryson’s milk and turn my tragedy into a blessing,” states Amy Anderson, from Caribou, Maine. 
 
 In the fall of 2010, Anderson lost her son Bryson at 20 weeks gestation. Trusting her intuition, she disregarded her physician’s advice to “bind your breasts and take Sudafed.” Instead, she began to pump the breast milk that would have nourished Bryson. 
 
 “At the time, I didn’t know what I would do with the milk, but I knew I needed to stop trying to prevent my body from lactating,” remembers Anderson. 
 
 She began to research and quickly discovered there was a great need for donor breast milk, especially with regard to the best practices of care employed to save the lives of prematurely born babies. 
 
 As we celebrate the holiday season, and in honor of the newly opened breast milk bank at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the following interview with Anderson provides important reflections on gratitude and grief. 
 
 Furthermore, Anderson’s experience of being discriminated against at work when seeking to have breastfeeding laws apply to her situation necessitates the need for legislative change. Certainly, lactating surrogates and bereaved mothers who pump breast milk deserve not only respect but also legal protection. 
 
 Amy, tell me about yourself. 
 
 I live in Caribou, Maine -- up north by the Canadian border. I married my high-school sweetheart. We have two living children (ages 8 and 2-and-a-half) and four “angel babies” in between them. Currently, I am a work-at-home mom. I also volunteer online for Mothers’ Milk Bank Northeast (MMBNE) while working toward completing my certification as a breastfeeding consultant. 
 
 ""I pumped for 8 months to the day. Just imagine how many lives his nearly 92 gallons of milk saved!"" -- Amy Anderson 
 
 
 
 Tell me about your son Bryson. 
 
 We lost our third child, whom we named Bryson, in 2010. We discovered at 15 weeks gestation that our son had a lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO). Tragically, the morning before our appointment to finally schedule his surgery, Bryson died in utero. His heart couldn’t handle the pressure that was building up in his bladder. I delivered his body at the age of 20 weeks. 
 
 I am so sorry to hear about your loss. Your son died right before the fall and winter holiday season, right? 
 
 Yes. Bryson’s body was delivered on Oct. 30, and the holidays that year were simply unbearable. My grief was heavy, and while I found comfort in expressing milk in his name, no one in my family dared to talk about my baby. However, that is actually what I needed the most. 
 
 A mother’s love is a mother’s love regardless of whether or not her child lives or dies. 
 
 What inspired you to begin pumping breast milk following Bryson’s death? 
 
 No one prepared me for what would happen to my breasts after Bryson was born. In fact, I was told that it was way too early for breast milk to be produced by my body. But this was a horrible misconception. Within a couple days after delivering Bryson, my milk came in. My rock-hard chest was throbbing, and milk saturated everything. No one suggested the option of donating Bryson’s milk. 
 
 I knew I wasn’t supposed to pump, as breastfeeding is based on a supply-and-demand relationship. But I was in horrid pain, so I decided to pump “just a little” to relieve my body. Six ounces of colostrum milk were expressed during a couple minutes of that first pumping session. I felt such relief. 
 
 As I expressed the milk, a real sense of calm descended. I felt a powerful closeness to my Bryson, which reminded me how much I loved the breastfeeding relationship I had shared with my eldest son. Pumping milk in Bryson’s memory felt so very right. All life has meaning, and my son’s life was no different. I decided to embrace his life’s purpose. 
 
 Tell me more about “his life’s purpose.” 
 
 At first, I couldn’t understand why Bryson was taken. I would hear of parents who didn’t want their children, who would beat them, and nothing made sense. Yet, through pumping and donating his milk, I came to see that Bryson’s death held a blessing in disguise. 
 
 Because Bryson was so early, my milk was deemed “preterm breast milk” and was very nutrient-rich. In fact, it was considerably healthier than full-term breast milk, as my body made it to sustain the life of a significantly premature baby. It is normal practice for the milk bank to combine the milk of three or more donors, but they kept Bryson’s milk separate and gave it to the highest of high-needs babies. It really was off the charts how phenomenal his milk was. I pumped for eight months to the day. Just imagine how many lives his nearly 92 gallons of milk saved! 
 
 How do you hold space for both your grief and gratitude? 
 
 The grief of losing my son is a reflection of the love I have for him. I couldn’t give my love or milk to Bryson, as he wasn’t there in the physical sense. Yet I was able to express my love for him through expressing and donating his milk. It was very healing both physically and emotionally. 
 
 While there are definitely still tears, my heart fills with mother’s pride as I share his story. Through my grief, I have found gratitude, and my sense of gratitude continues to multiply. I’ve learned to always look for the blessing in a situation, though it quite possibly is disguised. Honestly, I could, and will, talk about his legacy forever. 
 
 What specific benefits do premature babies receive through donor breast milk? 
 
 I wanted to do everything I could by donating Bryson’s milk to help families avoid the heartbreak of baby loss. As I researched, I learned about necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is an excruciatingly painful bowel disease that causes parts of the intestines to die. NEC is the second-leading cause of death for premature babies. 
 
 According to the NEC Society, the use of a human milk diet [mother's own milk or donor milk] can lower the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis by 79 percent. As Diane L. Spatz [Ph.D., RN-BC] writes: “In the NICU, human milk must be viewed as a medical intervention that is just as important as IV nutrition or a ventilator.” 
 
 Premature babies suffer when given formula, which is incredibly unhealthy for their immature digestive system. Human breast milk is by far the better option. It absolutely saves lives. In this sense, donating breast milk isn’t so different from organ donation. Bereaved lactating women can offer irreplaceable life-saving nutrients in honor of their precious angel babies. 
 
 You pumped for eight months and worked outside of the home during this time. As a lactating bereaved mother, how were you treated? 
 
 My former employer insisted that rights protected under the Break Time for Nursing Mothers law didn’t pertain to my situation. 
 
 “Your baby is dead,” the administrators told me. 
 
 These words stung like a second grief. Whether or not I had a baby, I was a lactating woman with physical needs. 
 
 The terminology in our federal law relating to the rights of breastfeeding mothers at work is a real problem. Federal law stipulates that breaks to express milk only apply to “nursing mothers” who pump “for her nursing child.” While I wasn’t expressing milk for a living, nursing child of my own, I was expressing milk for many high-risk infants who may otherwise die without a supply of healthy donor milk. 
 
 While I have completely moved forward from this workplace experience, I am dedicated to changing the terminology of the federal law to be formally inclusive of all lactating women. Currently, bereaved and surrogate mothers who chose to express breast milk can be excluded from the protection of the federal mandate due to the terminology used. However, all lactating women deserve the same rights. 
 
 In addition to contacting our legislators about this topic, what more can be done to support bereaved mothers? 
 
 I am trying to encourage professionals involved in caring for pregnant women to discuss lactation following birth -- including lactation after loss. I realize that donating through grief is not right for everyone. But for bereaved women to make an informed choice about the matter, they first need to know that pumping and donating their baby’s milk is an option. 
 
 Amy, I’ve so enjoyed speaking with you, and I thank you for your time. Do you have any final thoughts to share before we conclude? 
 
 As Bryson’s mother, it is such an honor to have this opportunity to bring support and advocacy to mothers faced with lactation following the devastation of baby loss. Equally as important is the education of individuals about the benefits of this unique form of organ donation that can be completely life-changing for the many precious recipients of donor milk.

 Breastfeeding is great for all newborns, but it's even more important if your baby arrives early. That's because your body will automatically produce milk that's specially designed to nourish your premature baby, with extra calories, vitamins, and protein. What's more, the live cells in breast milk that protect babies from infection can be even more important for premature babies: Preemies face a higher risk of infection because their immune systems are particularly immature. You will find artificial formulas and supplements made just for preemies, but they can't provide the antibodies and other protective factors that are in your breast milk and are so beneficial to a fragile premature infant. 
 
 Whether or not your baby is ready to nurse at your breast right away will depend on his gestational age and overall health. At many hospitals it's standard practice to start off feeding very premature babies expressed breast milk through a nasogastric (NG) tube (known as gavage). This is to make sure the baby gets as much nourishment as possible if he's too immature to suckle from breast or bottle. 
 
 You'll work closely with the hospital staff overseeing your baby's care on a plan to feed your pumped breast milk to your baby. Many preemies simply aren't ready to start breastfeeding in the hospital right away, and won't be released until they've started to gain weight from breast- and/or bottle-feeding. 
 
 Once your baby is able to start nursing at the breast, be prepared to nurse frequently, although preemies may not take in much milk at each feeding until they're closer to term. For this reason, you'll need to pump after feedings to keep up your milk production as well as have milk for any necessary supplementary feedings. You may need to use different breastfeeding holds for your preemie. Hospital staff, including lactation professionals, may be helpful when you start breastfeeding. 
 
 What challenges could I face? 
 
 If your baby is too immature to breastfeed right after birth, your initial challenge will be to stimulate and maintain your milk supply. The most efficient and convenient way to do this is to use a hospital-grade pump with a double collection kit (a hospital nurse or lactation consultant will get one for you and show you how to use it). You'll also eventually want to rent one to use for the first several weeks at home, until you're sure your baby is feeding well at your breast. 
 
 Once your baby is ready to move on to the breast, learning how to latch on and suck can be difficult. Most babies don't develop the suck-swallow-breathe reflex that's critical for feeding until about week 32 in the womb, eight weeks before they're considered full-term. It can also be challenging to figure out whether your baby is getting enough by breast alone if you're used to supplementing feedings. 
 
 A common rule in taking care of preterm babies is to limit how much they cry, on the theory that crying wastes precious energy better devoted to growing. Of course, it's harder to care for a baby when you can't wait for him to cry out to say he's hungry or uncomfortable. You'll have to learn to anticipate your baby's hunger, which takes time. 
 
 How can I solve these problems? 
 
 You can start by tuning in to your baby's cues. To minimize crying and maximize intake, you must figure out when your baby wants to eat, and when he'll be ready for the next feeding. This isn't easy because premature babies tend to be quieter when asking for food than their full-term peers. Wakefulness may be the only clue that he's getting hungry, instead of the full-throated wail heard in most nurseries. 
 
 You'll also want to continue to pump after you nurse to make sure you're keeping up your supply. You may want to hire a lactation consultant to help you check your baby's weight gain, or consider renting an electronic scale so you can weigh your baby before and after nursing sessions to see how much he's taking in. 
 
 Aim for feeding your baby at least every three hours or so, about eight feedings every 24 hours. This schedule is flexible, and if he seems hungry only two hours after eating, by all means let him try again. It's also okay to wake him up to nurse. In fact, disturbing a nap may actually trigger the suckling instinct. 
 
 The life of a preterm baby is little more than eating and sleeping, and when your baby's not eating, you need to think about how to get him to eat. This may mean, for example, unwrapping him, or even taking off his clothes to stimulate his need for comfort, and for suckling. 
 
 Where can I get more help? 
 
 La Leche League International (LLLI) is a great place to direct all your breastfeeding-related questions, and they'll probably be able to introduce you to other moms who are nursing premature children. You may want to hire a lactation consultant to help you through the early weeks. Doctors and nurses will certainly be able to answer a lot of your questions, but you may need more hands-on help. LLLI also has books and other resources for moms of preterm babies.","– Pre-eclampsia forced Amy Hanson to have an emergency C-section at just over 27 weeks gestation. Her daughter, Adalyn ""Addie"" Rose, measured just 12 inches long. ""Her diaper was the size of a Splenda packet, so small,"" Hanson tells the Chicago Tribune. In the first days of Addie's life, Amy was only able to see her via FaceTime. Still, she began pumping, ""the rhythm of the machine and flow of breast milk, connecting mom and baby when no other connection was possible,"" the Tribune writes. Addie died after 160 days in the NICU; a few weeks later, Hanson pumped for the last time, then gave away all her excess milk: 5,000 frozen ounces—that's nearly 40 gallons—or enough to feed about 22 preemies for a month, nurses say. And it's the perfect food for them, per BabyCenter, which explains the mother's body in these cases produces milk with ""extra calories, vitamins, and protein."" The executive director of the newly opened Mothers' Milk Bank of the Western Great Lakes tells the Tribune that nine bereaved mothers have given since January.

She donated the milk she had pumped, telling the Tribune in 2014 that it was ""comforting"" that other babies could use what her son couldn't. One of those babies was Levi John Limmo, who, born at about 23 weeks, went on to survive.

66,"Thirty years ago this month the U.S. and other industrialized countries signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. It was a “milestone for all people and our planet,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who highlighted the positive impacts of the Montreal Protocol on human health, poverty eradication, climate change, and protecting the food chain at an anniversary celebration. 
 
 The Earth’s ozone layer would have collapsed by 2050 with catastrophic consequences without the Montreal Protocol, studies have shown. In the world we avoided thanks to the Protocol the UV Index measure during a Washington, DC or Los Angles mid-summer day would be at least 30 by 2070. Anything over 11 is considered extreme. There would have been an additional 280 million cases of skin cancer, 1.5 million skin cancer deaths, and 45 million cataracts in the United States, according to the U.S. EPA. 
 
 Further, climate change would have been far worse by mid-century because the chemicals that “eat” ozone are also super-greenhouse gases, thousands of times more potent than CO2. And that would have meant the potential intensity of hurricanes and cyclones would have increased three times, another study found. 
 
 The combined impacts of UV levels that could literally burn skin in five minutes and hotter, stormier weather is something no one would want to live in or wish for their grandchildren, said Rolando Garcia, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. 
 
 Our global climate would be at least 25 per cent hotter today without the Protocol, said Garcia, a co-author of two world-avoided studies. That additional heat energy would have provided “fuel“ for today’s extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and droughts. By 2070 the world would have been 4.5 degrees F (2.5 degrees Celsius) hotter, a level most experts agree is disastrously high. 
 
 “In 1987 I don’t think anyone knew about the full climate implications,” said Garcia. “The Protocol saved our bacon a little bit.” 
 
 Ozone Politics 
 
 The ozone layer acts like a shield reducing the amount of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation to safer levels. By the late 1970s scientists proved chemicals used in fridges, air conditioners, and aerosol cans were damaging this ozone shield. But the chemical industry argued the science was uncertain, and more research was needed. Then, in 1985, a gigantic hole appeared in the ozone layer over Antarctica, allowing dangerous levels of UV radiation to reach the surface. By 1987 the Montreal Protocol was created to reduce the amounts of those chemicals. 
 
 Industry lobbied the Ronald Reagan White House and tried to get the Senate to deny ratification of the Protocol, warning of dire economic impacts resulting from a phase-down of their products. 
 
 “It was just as bad as the fossil fuel industry has been on climate change,” said David Doniger, Director, Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

 And yet the U.S. was one of the first countries to ratify the Protocol and have been a leader on the revisions that sped up the phase-outs of ozone-destroying chemicals, Doniger said. Industry soon developed new products and got on board with the phase-out of the old chemicals. 
 
 The Protocol now has 197 countries participating and resulted in the phase-out of 99 percent of nearly 100 ozone-depleting chemicals. It’s often considered the most successful international environmental treaty in history. 
 
 ""Thirty years ago the world proved it can come together and tackle a global problem with global resolve,” said Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). 
 
 “The Montreal Protocol is as necessary today as it was in the 1980s,” Solheim said. 
 
 Unfinished Business 
 
 The ozone layer is expected to recover by 2050 but the Protocol has two major pieces of unfinished business. Some countries in the developing world haven’t yet phased out ozone-damaging chemicals like R-22, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) found in many refrigeration and air conditioning systems. They’ll require financial support to do so, which the Protocol provides under its Multilateral Fund. 
 
 The Multilateral Fund will need to be replenished for the next three years at the upcoming Montreal Protocol conference in November. The U.S. usually provides about 20 percent of the funding, but “the Trump Administration has been completely silent on this so far,” said Doniger. 
 
 This funding is crucial to help poor countries not only eliminate the last ozone-damaging chemicals but also to leapfrog cheap replacement chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). While HFCs are safe for ozone, they are a powerful greenhouse gas, a thousand times worse than CO2. In 2016, after nearly ten years of negotiations, more than 150 countries agreed to reduce their use by 85 percent in the coming decades. 
 
 The use of HFCs for air conditioning and refrigeration is growing at a fast pace in developing countries, particularly China and India, Doniger said. That’s in part because climate change is producing more and longer deadly heat waves and driving up summer temperatures. 
 
 This HFC phase down is known as the Kigali Amendment to the Protocol and would have a big impact on climate change, cutting global warming up to 0.9 degrees F (0.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century, according to the UNEP. 
 
 That’s a big deal because even limiting global warming to under 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees Celsius) will still cut Africa’s agricultural yields by 40 percent, putting 50 percent of the continent’s population at risk of undernourishment. ||||| Illegal production of CFC-11 in China has a climate impact equivalent to 16-20 coal power plants, the Environmental Investigation Agency estimates 
 
 By Megan Darby 
 
 Chinese factories are illegally producing chemicals that damage the ozone layer and the climate. 
 
 That was revealed in a survey of manufacturers carried out by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and corroborated by the New York Times on Monday. 
 
 The EIA identified eight companies in four provinces that were using CFC-11 in the production of plastic foams, which are most commonly used for building insulation. It is one of a group of chemicals banned under the 1987 Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer. 
 
 “These and other well placed sources in the Chinese chemical industry strongly suggest that this is a wider practice,” said the agency’s Avipsa Mahapatra. 
 
 The green watchdog estimates up to 70% of Chinese rigid foam production uses CFC-11, which has a global warming effect as well as depleting ozone. By the EIA’s calculation, this illegal activity has a climate impact equivalent to 16-20 coal power stations. 
 
 Its findings go a long way to explain mysteriously high levels of the pollutant detected by air monitors, in data published in Nature last month.

 A factory owner in Xingfu, Shandong province, told the NYT he only found out CFC-11 was bad for the atmosphere last year – and it was cheaper than the substitutes. 
 
 As he spoke to the reporter, Zhang Wenbo was ordered by officials to close his refrigerator plant, in a crackdown across the town. Evidence of other illegal production hotspots has been passed to the Chinese authorities. 
 
 Climate Home News previously reported that the Montreal Protocol’s scientific assessment panel is due to examine rogue emissions and report to national representatives by the end of the year. 
 
 Production of chlorofluorocarbons, which were also used as coolants, was fully banned in developed countries from 1996. The developing world was given until 2010 to phase out usage, with financial support to switch to substitutes. 
 
 In the 1990s and early 2000s, a certain amount of black market activity was exposed, but the discovery of widespread illegal activity so long after the deadline shocked experts. 
 
 “It is outrageous that industrial climate-killers banned several years ago continue to be produced, used and emitted at this scale in an industry where better technology is easily available. This could undermine not just the slowly healing ozone but also the global efforts to battle climate change,” said Mahapatra. 
 
 Approved substitutes for CFC-11 also have a global warming effect, but it is much less strong. The intermediate option, HCFC-141b, has around a sixth the global warming potential, and cleaner options are available. 
 
 In 2016, countries agreed to amend the Montreal Protocol to tackle the climate impact of HFCs, which have replaced CFCs in many applications. Phasing them out could prevent up to 0.5C of warming this century, scientists estimate. 
 
 The latest exposé shows why the deal needs to have teeth, said Mahapatra. “EIA has been calling for tougher measures to deal with illegal production and trade. These findings prove once again that ​enforcement is not a luxury but necessary to the success of the Montreal Protocol.” 
 
 Republish this article","– Across the world, someone has been illegally producing an ozone-destroying gas banned more than 30 years ago. Now, investigators and the New York Times may have pinpointed the culprit behind the CFC-11 chlorofluorocarbon: factories making foam insulation in remote parts of China. Putting CFC-11 in the insulation, which is used in buildings and refrigerators, isn't as costly as legal alternatives, and some factory owners were surprisingly frank with the Times about their usage. ""Of course, we chose the cheaper foam agent,"" one factory owner, whose plant has since been shut down, says. ""That's how we survived."" The Environmental Investigation Agency, an independent watchdog, says it found at least eight factories in China using CFC-11 to make foam. The EIA estimates up to 70% of foam production there uses the chemical, per Climate Home News. An expert tells the Times that factories using CFC-11, a violation of 1987's Montreal Protocol, are often smaller operations (some don't even have names) that move around rural outposts to avoid detection; if they do get caught, they simply shrug and pay any fines, if they're not shut down. A study published in Nature in May stressed the issues that this unexpected jump in CFC-11 emissions could pose, namely pushing back the full recovery of the ozone layer by at least 10 years (the target date was originally for the middle of this century). The head of the UN's Environment Program tells the Times that the renewed CFC-11 production is ""an environment crime"" that requires immediate action. ""We have to dig deeper,"" Erik Solheim says in a statement. ""Based on the scale of detected emissions, there is good reason to believe the problem extends beyond these uncovered cases.""

67,"It took only 60,000 years to kill more than 90 percent of all life on Earth, according to the most precise study yet of the Permian mass extinction, the greatest die-off in the past 540 million years. 
 
 The new timeline doesn't reveal the culprit behind the die-off, though scientists have several suspects, such as volcanic eruptions in Siberia that belched massive quantities of climate-changing gases. But pinning down the duration of the Permian mass extinction will help researchers refine its potential trigger mechanisms, said Seth Burgess, lead study author and a geochemist at MIT. 
 
 ""Whatever caused the extinction was really rapid, or the biosphere reached some critical threshold,"" Burgess told Live Science. ""Having an accurate timeline for the events surrounding the mass extinction and the interval itself is extremely important, because it gives us an idea of how the biosphere responds."" 
 
 The findings were published today (Feb. 10) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
 
 Radioactivity and extinctions 
 
 The Permian mass extinction marks the end of the Permian geologic period, which ended approximately 252 million years ago. More than 96 percent of marine life and 70 percent of land species perished. By comparison, 85 percent of life died off during the dinosaur-killing extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years ago. [Wipe Out: History's Most Mysterious Extinctions] 
 
 ""This is one of the fundamental inflection points in the trajectory of life on Earth,"" Burgess said. ""It set the stage for the [rest] of evolution."" 
 
 The best record of the Permian ""great dying"" is in Meishan, China. In past decades, hundreds of geologists collected and analyzed rocks in Meishan that date from before, during and after the Permian extinction. Researchers analyzed these rocks to better understand what caused the Permian event. Volcanic ash beds interlaced with Meishan marine rocks have tiny minerals called zircons that can be precisely dated with geochemical techniques, and the marine rocks carry scores of fossils that record the die-off and resurgence of life. 
 
 Burgess and his co-authors improved the Meishan rock ages with the latest high-resolution, uranium-lead zircon dating techniques. Zircon traps minute amounts of naturally occurring radioactive uranium inside its crystal structure. Uranium decays into lead, and counting the ratio of the two elements provides an age estimate for the zircons. 
 
 The new dates show that the mass extinction started 251.941 million years ago (plus or minus 37,000 years) and ended at 251.880 million years ago (plus or minus 31,000 thousand years). The extinction's end also marks the start of the Triassic period, and coincides with the first fossil appearance at Meishan of a toothy, eel-like creature called Hindeodus parvus (a conodont, the source of the earliest teeth found in the fossil record). 
 
 Finding the killer(s) 
 
 The new timeline also provides greater accuracy for the environmental blows linked with the mass dying. For example, previous work has found an increase in carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, before the mass extinction began. In the Permian rocks, atmospheric carbon dioxide shifts are recorded as changes in the ratio of carbon isotopes. 
 
 The new study suggests the increase in carbon dioxide was sudden and short-lived, Burgess said. ""It precedes the extinction by 20,000 years or so, and lasts 10,000 or 15,000 years. It was very short-duration event,"" he said. 
 
 But there are other potential tipping points for extinction beyond atmospheric greenhouse gases. For example, sea surface temperatures also rose about 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) over a period beginning before the extinction and continuing into the early Triassic. And the sudden carbon dioxide increase may have made the oceans more acidic. (A similar effect is happening in the present age due to carbon dioxide concentrations that have been rising because of man-made sources since the 1850s.) [Top 10 Ways to Destroy Earth] 
 
 ""An accurate and high-precision age model gives us a reliable sounding [board] against which we can start comparing all of the other things that started happening with the mass extinction,"" Burgess said. 
 
 The research team is now applying the same age-dating technique to one of the main Permian mass extinction suspects, volcanic rocks from the Siberian Traps, one of the largest volcanic outpourings on Earth.

Multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what's now known as the end-Permian extinction, including an asteroid impact, massive volcanic eruptions, or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events.

 Now researchers at MIT have determined that the end-Permian extinction occurred over 60,000 years, give or take 48,000 years—practically instantaneous, from a geologic perspective. The new timescale is based on more precise dating techniques, and indicates that the most severe extinction in history may have happened more than 10 times faster than scientists had previously thought. 
 
 ""We've got the extinction nailed in absolute time and duration,"" says Sam Bowring, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. ""How do you kill 96 percent of everything that lived in the oceans in tens of thousands of years? It could be that an exceptional extinction requires an exceptional explanation."" 
 
 In addition to establishing the extinction's duration, Bowring, graduate student Seth Burgess, and a colleague from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology also found that, 10,000 years before the die-off, the oceans experienced a pulse of light carbon, which likely reflects a massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This dramatic change may have led to widespread ocean acidification and increased sea temperatures by 10 degrees Celsius or more, killing the majority of sea life. 
 
 But what originally triggered the spike in carbon dioxide? The leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread, long-lasting volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps, a region of Russia whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma. To determine whether eruptions from the Siberian Traps triggered a massive increase in oceanic carbon dioxide, Burgess and Bowring are using similar dating techniques to establish a timescale for the Permian period's volcanic eruptions that are estimated to have covered over five million cubic kilometers. 
 
 ""It is clear that whatever triggered extinction must have acted very quickly,"" says Burgess, the lead author of a paper that reports the results in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ""fast enough to destabilize the biosphere before the majority of plant and animal life had time to adapt in an effort to survive."" 
 
 Pinning dates on an extinction 
 
 In 2006, Bowring and his students made a trip to Meishan, China, a region whose rock formations bear evidence of the end-Permian extinction; geochronologists and paleontologists have flocked to the area to look for clues in its layers of sedimentary rock. In particular, scientists have focused on a section of rock that is thought to delineate the end of the Permian, and the beginning of the Triassic, based on evidence such as the number of fossils found in surrounding rock layers. 
 
 Bowring sampled rocks from this area, as well as from nearby alternating layers of volcanic ash beds and fossil-bearing rocks. After analyzing the rocks in the lab, his team reported in 2011 that the end-Permian likely lasted less than 200,000 years. However, this timeframe still wasn't precise enough to draw any conclusions about what caused the extinction. 
 
 Now, the team has revised its estimates using more accurate dating techniques based on a better understanding of uncertainties in timescale measurements. 
 
 With this knowledge, Bowring and his colleagues reanalyzed rock samples collected from five volcanic ash beds at the Permian-Triassic boundary. The researchers pulverized rocks and separated out tiny zircon crystals containing a mix of uranium and lead. They then isolated uranium from lead, and measured the ratios of both isotopes to determine the age of each rock sample. 
 
 From their measurements, the researchers determined a much more precise ""age model"" for the end-Permian extinction, which now appears to have lasted about 60,000 years—with an uncertainty of 48,000 years—and was immediately preceded by a sharp increase in carbon dioxide in the oceans. 
 
 'Spiraling toward the truth' 
 
 The new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps that released volatile chemicals, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and oceans. With such a short extinction timeline, Bowring says it is possible that a single, catastrophic pulse of magmatic activity triggered an almost instantaneous collapse of all global ecosystems. 
 
 To confirm whether the Siberian Traps are indeed the extinction's smoking gun, Burgess and Bowring plan to determine an equally precise timeline for the Siberian Traps eruptions, and will compare it to the new extinction timeline to see where the two events overlap. The researchers will investigate additional areas in China to see if the duration of the extinction can be even more precisely determined. 
 
 ""We've refined our approach, and now we have higher accuracy and precision,"" Bowring says. ""You can think of it as slowly spiraling in toward the truth.""

","– Roughly 252 million years ago, an extreme animal die-off occurred: 70% of land animals and 96% of marine life were obliterated, in what's known as the Permian mass extinction. What scientists still don't exactly know is why (an asteroid? volcanic eruptions?), but they now know how long it took. And the answer is ... really, really fast. MIT researchers say the extinction period's duration clocked in at 60,000 years, plus or minus 48,000 years. As Phys.org puts it, that's ""practically instantaneous, from a geological perspective."" To get your geological periods and catastrophic disasters straight: The die-off signified the end of the Permian period and launched the start of the Triassic; the mass die-off of the dinosaurs happened much later, 66 million years ago at the Cretaceous period's close, when LiveScience reports 85% of life was wiped out. The researchers came to their conclusion by using cutting-edge dating techniques on tiny minerals known as zircons found in rocks in Meishan, China, that date to the period. But the rocks also held carbon dioxide data; from there, the researchers determined that a surge of the gas occurred 10,000 to 20,000 years before the die-off: Ocean acidification may have have occurred, and sea temps could have jumped as much as 50 degrees. But what was the source of the increased carbon dioxide that marked the beginning of the end? MIT researchers are now dating rocks from the Siberian Traps to determine if volcanic eruptions there could have been the culprit.","<pad> The study is the most precise yet of the Permian mass extinction, the greatest die-off in the past 540 million years.</s>",0.10638297682209145,0.030888029333492422,0.10638297682209145
68,"Watching “Pee-wee’s Big Holiday,” a Netflix movie receiving a limited theatrical release, brought to mind the sensation evoked by Paul Reubens’ stage revival of the character several years ago: An initial rush of nostalgia and enthusiasm, which by the end had given way to silliness fatigue, and the question, “When will this be over?” That’s not a slam of the Pee-wee Herman experience, really, as much as a reminder that some things are best consumed in smaller doses than a 90-minute movie, much like those little root-beer barrels that Reubens’ perpetual child so adores. 
 
 Produced by Reubens with Judd Apatow, and co-written by the star with Paul Rust, who’s featured in Apatow’s Netflix series “Love,” “Big Holiday” is hardly a big idea. It is, rather, a collection of little ones, with Pee-wee having a chance encounter with a kindred spirit, played by Joe Manganiello, getting invited to a party and impulsively leaving his little town of Fairville for New York, despite his assertion in the early going, “I don’t want to go anywhere or try anything new.” 
 
 The subsequent road trip includes, but isn’t limited to, thieves, a stopover in Amish country, and what amounts to an extended farmer’s daughter joke. And, this being a Pee-wee adventure, there’s no shortage of word play, puns and loud, piercing screams.

 The producers have asked that reviewers not disclose certain plot points, which is odd, since the cited “spoilers” are almost wholly irrelevant. (They have also asked that the project be included in feature film coverage as opposed to television, which seems like a virtually meaningless distinction, given the likely consumption of this product, and the distribution pattern – streaming day and date online with its theatrical bow.) 
 
 The biggest surprise, frankly, might be that the funniest person here is frequently Manganiello. Indeed, the mere visual juxtaposition of the towering “Magic Mike” star and Reubens in the same frame together is practically a special effect in itself. 
 
 That said, unlike in “The Muppets” – which might be the franchise’s closest cousin spiritually speaking – there aren’t really a lot of celebrity cameos. Instead, first-time director John Lee (a veteran of Comedy Central’s “Inside Amy Schumer” and “Broad City”) simply bounces from episode to episode, until Pee-wee finally reaches his destination, and the movie, both sweetly and somewhat mercifully, runs out of time. 
 
 To his credit, Reubens remains as deft at bringing his man-sized child to life as he ever was, a staggering 35 years after inventing him. But it’s perhaps no accident that one of Pee-wee’s most treasured incarnations – beyond the 1985 movie “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure,” directed by Tim Burton – might be the more concentrated Saturday-morning TV show that adults and college kids greedily consumed, while their children and younger siblings identified the title character as one of them. 
 
 Pee-wee’s grasp of childhood has always been central to his charm. What’s more elusive is discerning a rhyme or reason to Netflix’s nascent movie strategy, which is obviously derived in part from the service’s closely held metrics – in this context, basically making new versions of stuff people already like to watch, like Adam Sandler movies – although how precisely the numbers add up on a project such as this is anybody’s guess. 
 
 “Pee-wee’s Big Holiday” is a harmless but not especially vital or necessary addition to that portfolio. As for those who would accuse a critic of being a party pooper for this assessment, the only appropriate response would be: “I know you are, but what am I?” ||||| ""Pee-wee's Big Holiday."" Netflix 
 
 When Paul Reubens created the Pee-wee Herman character in the early 1980s as a stage act, audiences instantly fell in love with not just the exterior — tight-fitting gray suit, red bow tie, unusual voice — but his childlike admiration for life and all its quirkiness. 
 
 Pee-wee then became a household name when Reubens structured the act as a children's TV show, then teamed with Tim Burton to make the classic ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure."" 
 
 With Netflix seemingly eager to bring back just about anything we're nostalgic for from the past few decades — ""Full House,"" ""Gilmore Girls"" — it jumped at the chance to make a new Pee-wee movie with Reubens and producer Judd Apatow. 
 
 And I'm here to tell you that ""Pee-wee's Big Holiday"" is as much fun as the first Pee-wee movie. (Let's just pretend ""Big Top Pee-wee"" never existed, OK?) 
 
 This time, Pee-wee is settled in the quaint 1950s-ish town that he's lived in his whole life. But then actor Joe Manganiello shows up — his name in the movie is Joe Manganiello — on his motorcycle and completely wows Pee-wee with his cool style. This motivates Pee-wee to do something he's never done in his life: leave town and take a holiday. 
 
 Joe Manganiello is the movie's secret weapon. Netflix 
 
 That's right, in this Pee-wee universe, he never went to the Alamo to find his bike, like he did in ""Big Adventure."" 
 
 But as with ""Big Adventure,"" Pee-wee embarks on a hilarious road trip that leads to strange encounters. Just a couple — that won't spoil anything as they are featured in the trailer — involve three female bank robbers who are dressed like they came straight out of ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" and a team of unique hairstylists. 
 
 There's a lot of fun in the silly gadgets featured throughout, from how Pee-wee wakes up every morning to the items of a traveling salesman Pee-wee gets a ride from. 
 
 In many ways, Reubens, who cowrote the screenplay with ""Love"" creator and star Paul Rust, uses the structure of ""Big Adventure"" to tell the story. There's a silly opening dream sequence, the road-trip storyline, and the goal of the trip, which is wackier this time around than finding his bike. 
 
 And then there's just Reubens' strange brand of humor that works as well today as it did in the '80s. I defy you not to laugh out loud during the balloon bit. 
 
 Yet the secret weapon of the movie, its modern touch, is Manganiello. He is extremely funny and has a chemistry with Reubens that you'd never think would work until you see it on the screen for yourself. 
 
 ""Pee-wee's Big Holiday"" is available to stream on Netflix starting on Friday. ||||| You can put a date on Pee-wee Herman’s peak popularity, but you can’t tie him to a particular time period. Inspired by the kiddie-TV hosts of the 1950s, Paul Reubens created Pee-wee in the ’80s, and gave the character a fascination with junk-store kitsch from practically every era of American pop culture. (Who else was showing their Batman Credit Card to David Letterman in 1984?) But there’s always been an edge of the new, now, and avant garde to the character as well, whether it’s trusting the design of his TV digs to Jimbo cartoonist Gary Panter or inviting Grace Jones to his Christmas party. So if Pee-wee Herman is to make a cinematic comeback in the 21st century, he might as well do it on Netflix, which puts Pee-wee’s Big Holiday—the first movie starring the character since 1988’s Big Top Pee-wee—on a cutting edge that people also use to watch Friends reruns. 
 
 
 
 But that distribution model also means that typing “Pee-wee” into the search bar brings up a Big Adventure and a Playhouse right alongside Big Holiday. The new film—directed by Wonder Showzen’s John Lee, produced by Judd Apatow, and co-written by Reubens with Love’s Paul Rust—doesn’t shy from comparisons to Pee-wee’s first, Tim Burton-helmed big-screen outing. The parallels are right there in the title, but the films also follow roughly the same structure, a hero’s journey that breaks Pee-wee out of his idiosyncratic small-town routine and sends him on an epic road trip. Pee-wee’s Big Holiday is a comeback vehicle, but it’s also an attempt to reprise one of the funniest movies ever made. To a large degree, it succeeds. 
 
 Big Holiday returns Pee-wee to the highways and byways for a shaggier, less rigorously paced adventure, finding frequent and long-lasting laughs along the way. At 63, Reubens’ physical and vocal range isn’t what it once was, but he still gives Pee-wee (and Big Holiday) an undeniable energy. Dulled though his tics and twitches might be, Reuben’s face still sparks to life in close-up, like a child discovering all the many ways to twist and contort the human features. It’s clear that Pee-wee and his weird, wonderful world continue to amuse and excite Reubens, and his Big Holiday collaborators share the sentiment. Lee’s direction doesn’t have the unmistakable personal stamp of a Burton, though that just gives more authorial control to the main character. Pee-wee’s Big Holiday is the Pee-wee movie that really makes its possessive apostrophe count. 
 
 When the film opens, Pee-wee has no interest in traveling beyond the borders of Fairville, a backlot burg that looks like a time capsule and runs like clockwork. (Everything’s so predictable in Fairville, the local diner even has color-coded hairnets that correspond to the days of the week.) While he’s slinging hash at that diner, Pee-wee strikes up a bond with a mysterious stranger (Joe Manganiello in the role he was born to play: “Joe Manganiello”), who encourages his new friend to “live a little,” and eventually hands him his ticket out of town: an invitation to Manganiello’s birthday party, all the way across the country in New York City. Between Fairville and the Big Apple, there are reptiles (and reptile puns), farmer’s daughters itching to get hitched, an Amish idyll, and a trio of bank robbers (Alia Shawkat, Stephanie Beatriz, and Jessica Pohly) that represent the closest thing Big Holiday has to antagonists. 
 
 If there’s anything tying together the detours and roadblocks that comprise Big Holiday, it’s the film’s big, bold, screaming celebration of human difference. Pee-wee sticks out from his square Fairville surroundings in the same way the character has always stuck out from the entertainment mainstream, and the characters he encounters on the road live similarly outsider existences, like a traveling salesman (Patrick Egan), a quartet of traveling hair stylists (Darryl Stephens, Dionne Gipson, Anthony Alabi, and Sonya Eddy), or an eccentric heiress (Diane Salinger, providing Big Holiday’s most poignant link to Big Adventure). The concept is made explicit in his first encounter with the bank robbers, but it runs beneath the surface of the entire film. Pee-wee is searching for other Pee-wees. 
 
 The film is littered with Easter eggs for the Pee-wee faithful, but it’s a bit of an homage to cinematic weirdos, too. The bank robbers appear to be refugees from a Russ Meyer movie (Pohly’s character takes some styling tips from Tura Satana in Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!), and there’s a touch of John Waters to the unmannered performances and the non-Hollywood looks of the supporting cast. Outside of the film’s potential Large Marge moment—a bit of gloopy CGI that’s raring to traumatize the youngest members of the streaming generation—that lack of polish is where Lee’s touch is most evident. Amid the fantasia that Reubens has spent decades crafting, the director coaxes a strange sort of naturalism out of the cast, which both complements and corresponds to Pee-wee’s manic energy. 
 
 Reubens and his collaborators appreciate the allure of the familiar, but they also understand its limitations. When Big Holiday mimics Big Adventure, it’s in an “any note you can reach, I can go higher” fashion: Its Rube Goldberg contraptions spill out of the Herman residence and into the streets of Fairville, and though Mark Mothersbaugh’s instrumental score resembles Danny Elfman’s compositions for Big Adventure, it ups their Raymond Scott quotient. There’s no frame as singularly stirring as Pee-wee’s nocturnal encounter with the Cabazon Dinosaurs; instead, that epic scale is translated to extended comic set-pieces that boldly challenge the “funny, then not funny, then way funnier than it was before” limits of The Rake Effect. Big Holiday may be a sequel in spirit only, but it definitely subscribes to the “like the first, but bigger” philosophy of other big-screen follow-ups. 
 
 From the slow-motion fantasy sequences where Joe Manganiello dons his own version of Pee-wee’s glen-plaid getup, to the finale where the ensemble members gather around their TVs to support the man-child who’s had an effect on each of their lives, Big Holiday is ultimately a testament to the lasting power of Reubens’ signature character. Like Fairville, he exists outside of time, and new generations of Pee-wee fans will be able to stream Big Holiday as part of the same, flat-circle pop-culture timeline as Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and Pee-wee’s Playhouse. For those who’ve stuck with the character after all this time, the movie is an unexpected bonus—one that, cheekily, encourages breaking out of comfort zones every once in a while.","– Pee-wee Herman is back in his first movie since 1988's Big Top Pee-wee—and this time he's coming to us via Netflix.

 The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating several companies for exorbitant drug price increases, including embattled Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals. 
 
 Shkreli became notorious after his company Turing hiked the price of Daraprim, the only approved drug for a rare and sometimes deadly parasitic infection, by 5,000 percent. Since then, Shkreli has been deluged with criticism from patients, politicians and the media, with some labeling him the ""most hated man in America."" 
 
 Last month, the 32-year-old former hedge fund manager was arrested in New York and charged with securities fraud and conspiracy related to another pharmaceutical company he previously ran called Retrophin. Shkreli pleaded not guilty and was released on $5 million bail. He resigned as CEO of Turing, which he founded and ran. 
 
 He could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday evening. 
 
 The House committee issued the demand January 11 under chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, according to a copy obtained by the Associated Press on Wednesday. 
 
 ""I have been trying for the better part of a year to get information from Martin Shkreli about his outrageous price increases, and he has obstructed our investigation at every turn,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, the committee's ranking Democrat. 
 
 Turing and Valeant Pharmaceuticals both previously refused requests for documents from Cummings and other Democrats. 
 
 The committee is also seeking testimony from Turing's chief commercial officer, Nancy Retzlaff, Valeant Pharmaceutical's interim CEO, Howard Schiller, and experts from government and the private sector. Calls placed to New York-based Turing were not immediately returned. 
 
 A spokeswoman for Laval, Quebec-based Valeant confirmed that Schiller will testify next week. He was named interim CEO earlier this month after the company's chairman and CEO, J. Michael Pearson, was hospitalized for severe pneumonia. 
 
 Concerns about sky-high drug prices have been building for years but boiled over last fall after news reports about Turing, Valeant and a handful of other drugmakers hiking prices of old drugs many times over their prior cost. 
 
 Valeant drew Congress' interest following its purchase of the life-saving heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel. The company, known for gobbling up smaller drugmakers to get their products and then slashing jobs and research programs, jacked up the drugs' prices shortly after buying them from Marathon Pharmaceuticals in February, tripling one and raising the other six-fold. 
 
 Daraprim, which Turing acquired in August, is the only approved drug for a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. 
 
 Amid mounting criticism from patients, doctors and politicians, Shkreli pledged to lower Daraprim's price, but later reneged and instead offered hospitals a 50 percent discount — still amounting to a 2,500 percent increase. Patients normally take most of the weeklong treatment at home, so they still face the 5,000 percent price increase, though Turing is offering financial aid to those who can't afford the drug. 
 
 Both Turing and Valeant have also received multiple subpoenas from federal prosecutors seeking information about drug pricing and other business practices. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

 WASHINGTON — Martin Shkreli, reviled former chief executive officer at Turing Pharmaceuticals, has invoked the Fifth Amendment in refusing to produce documents subpoenaed by a Senate committee investigating drug-pricing practices, the panel's chairwoman said Wednesday. 
 
 Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on Twitter that the investigation by the Senate Special Committee on Aging could be hindered without Shkreli's cooperation. 
 
 “Absent a valid justification for the grounds for invoking the Fifth Amendment, Mr. Shkreli’s assertion could hinder our investigation.” — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) January 20, 2016 
 
 Word of Shkreli's refusal to cooperate with the Senate investigation came after it was reported that House lawmakers have issued a subpoena to compel Shkreli to appear at a congressional hearing next Tuesday. 
 
 An aide to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform confirmed the news to the Associated Press. The committee is investigating several companies for exorbitant drug price increases. ||||| As for Tuesday’s hearing in the House, also scheduled to testify are Howard B. Schiller, the interim chief executive of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Nancy Retzlaff, chief commercial officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals, the drug company that Mr. Shkreli formerly ran. 
 
 Mr. Schiller and Ms. Retzlaff are expected to appear voluntarily. Mr. Schiller was appointed by Valeant’s board to temporarily run the company after J. Michael Pearson, its chief executive, was hospitalized late last year with a severe case of pneumonia. Valeant has also been criticized for its pricing policies and is facing a federal inquiry as well as congressional scrutiny. 
 
 “Mr. Schiller looks forward to testifying and sharing with the committee how Valeant works to make its drugs available to the millions of patients who depend on them,” said Laurie W. Little, a spokeswoman for Valeant. 
 
 At a JPMorgan Chase health care conference last week, Mr. Schiller said he anticipated being called to testify before Congress and added, “you survive these things and then you move on.” 
 
 It is not known if Mr. Shkreli will attend the committee hearing with any lawyers. On Monday, one of his lawyers notified a federal judge in Brooklyn that Mr. Shkreli was replacing his entire legal team at Arnold & Porter and seeking to hire new counsel to represent him in the pending criminal securities fraud case.

 When asked about the hearing and whether he would attend, Mr. Shkreli wrote in an email, “I made it clear that you are not to contact me ever again.” 
 
 But in a posting on Twitter later in the day, Mr. Shkreli wrote: “House busy whining to health care reporters about me appearing for their chitchat next week. Haven’t decided yet. Should I?” 
 
 There may be no legal risk to Mr. Shkreli in testifying about large price increases in the drug industry. The federal securities charges against him involve accusations that he defrauded investors in two former hedge funds he ran and are unrelated to accusations of price gouging by Turing.

 Its decision to increase the price of the drug Daraprim a month after the company acquired it spurred outrage last fall from some politicians and media commentators. On Twitter, some people branded him the “bad boy of pharma.” Immediately after acquiring the rights to Daraprim, which has been used for decades to treat a life-threatening parasitic infection, Turing raised the price to $750 a tablet from $13.50. 
 
 But rather than be shamed by the outrage, Mr. Shkreli seemed to revel in it and defended the decision. Over the next several months, he frequently justified the price increase on Twitter and appeared in many news articles. 
 
 He has maintained his public persona even after prosecutors in Brooklyn filed a criminal complaint in mid-December. 
 
 In advance of Tuesday’s hearing, Turing and its interim chief executive, Ron Tilles, were asked to produce documents relating to Daraprim from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2015, according to a copy of a Jan. 6 letter sent by the committee. The letter, signed by Representatives Jason Chaffetz, a Republican of Utah and the committee’s chairman, and its top Democrat, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, also asked for “copies of all documents previously produced” in response to requests from other government agencies. 
 
 Mr. Cummings, in a statement, said he looked forward to the hearing and having a chance to speak to Mr. Shkreli. “He claims publicly that he wants to explain to Congress how drug pricing works,” Mr. Cummings said. “On Tuesday, he will get his chance.”","– Martin Shkreli ""loves to talk,"" notes the New York Times, but the ex-Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO has taken the Fifth as a Senate committee looks into drug-pricing practices—and his refusal to hand over subpoenaed documents could impede the probe, NBC News reports. ""Absent a valid justification for the grounds for invoking the Fifth Amendment, Mr. Shkreli's assertion could hinder our investigation,"" Maine Sen. Susan Collins, chair of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, tweeted Wednesday. To which Shkreli responded later Wednesday night: ""@SenatorCollins I have valid justification. Are you serious? I have constitutional rights. No wonder trust in the US Government is at a low."" This development comes just days before Shkreli's subpoena-mandated appearance Tuesday at a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which is looking into several companies accused of excessively hiking prices, the AP reports. ""I have been trying for the better part of a year to get information from Martin Shkreli about his outrageous price increases, and he has obstructed our investigation at every turn,"" Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings said in a statement Wednesday, per CNNMoney. Shkreli dished about the upcoming hearing on Twitter Wednesday, posting a pic of what appeared to be the House subpoena and striking back at Cummings. ""House busy whining to healthcare reporters about me appearing for their chit chat next week. Haven't decided yet. Should I? @RepCummings,"" he tweeted. ""He claims publicly that he wants to explain to Congress how drug pricing works. On Tuesday, he will get his chance,"" Cummings said in his statement. When asked by the Times if he would be at Tuesday's hearing, Shkreli emailed, ""I made it clear that you are not to contact me ever again.""

 The encounter, at Route 16 and Galen Street around 11:20 a.m. Wednesday, unfolded in full view of people waiting at an MBTA bus stop near the border with Newton. 
 
 Carlos Gonzalez-Moreno said he was waiting to board a T bus when he saw the truck stop — and stay there, even though other drivers began blowing their horns in apparent frustration.

 Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan, whose office is helping to investigate the incident, said at a press conference Watertown police responded to a 911 call for a road-rage incident. She said the woman who was struck was pronounced dead at the scene. 
 
 Relatives identified her as Benita Horner, 68, and the man who allegedly stabbed the driver as her son, Philip. The two were described as very close, sharing an apartment in a complex for seniors in Belmont. 
 
 The district attorney’s office declined to confirm either identity Wednesday night. 
 
 Ryan said the suspect stabbed the tow-truck driver approximately five times in the torso. The driver was in critical condition in a Boston hospital, she said.

 Ryan said the suspect, in police custody, was taken to a hospital. She would not say what prompted the man’s hospitalization. The incident is under investigation by Watertown and State Police, she said. 
 
 The violence stunned witnesses in a busy corner of Watertown. 
 
 “The son went crazy,” said Zeidan Taha, the manager at Watertown Taxi, who was among the first to call police. 
 
 Taha said the woman was crossing the street with her son when she was run over by the tow truck and suffered a catastrophic head injury. 
 
 The son was furious, screaming in the street, Taha said. He confronted the tow-truck driver with a knife, he said.

 “The guy kept stabbing him and chasing him all over, around the truck,” said Taha, adding the victim suffered wounds in the stomach and back. 
 
 The driver repeatedly told the angry man, “I didn’t see her! I didn’t see her!,” he said. 
 
 Sheryl Leonard, who is Benita Horner’s stepdaughter, described her as a doting mother and grandmother. 
 
 “She really loved her son,’’ she said. “I can’t imagine him seeing what happened to her today.” 
 
 Growing up in Watertown, Leonard recalled Horner’s love of cooking. Pepper steak and fried chicken were among the culinary highlights, she said. 
 
 “She was a great cook,” she said. 
 
 Leonard, 53, now lives in Maryland, where she is raising Philip’s son. 
 
 Mark Horner, Philip’s half-brother and Benita’s stepson, said Benita’s priority in recent years was talking care of Philip. Horner, who lives in North Attleborough, said he had not seen Benita in about five years. 
 
 “It’s a sad thing,” the North Attleborough resident said over the phone on Wednesday night. “We feel bad for the tow truck driver and his family. Hopefully he makes it.” 
 
 Portions of Route 16 — also known as Watertown Street — were closed while police investigated. Horner’s body, which appeared to have landed underneath the wheels of the truck, was covered with a white sheet. 
 
 Yellow police tape was strung up around the intersection and yellow evidence markers dotted the sidewalk. One was placed next to what appeared to be blood stains. 
 
 “This was a bad scene over here,” Watertown Police Chief Michael Lawn said.

 Johnny Depp has just filed legal docs citing new evidence that he never beat then-wife Amber Heard ... a claim she made during their acrimonious divorce. 
 
 Depp filed the docs in the U.K., where he's suing The Sun for defamation in connection with an article calling him ""wife-beater."" The article referenced an altercation between Depp and Heard on May 21, 2016 at their downtown L.A. home. Amber says he threw a phone at her face and then pummeled her and she took photos of her injuries. 
 
 Depp's new documents include witness statements, saying they saw Amber in the apartment building on May 21 and saw no red marks or bruising on her face. One witness says she didn't see the mark until 6 days later. 
 
 Amber also took photos of broken glass in the apartment, claiming Johnny hurled glass and shattered it in the unit. One of the witnesses states in his declaration, ""There was no smashed glass that I noticed in the apartment at the time."" 
 
 Amber has adamantly stuck by her version of events, and Johnny has implied she injured herself after the fact and took pictures. 
 
 He also cites in the documents 2 cops who responded on May 21 and gave 2 depositions stating they saw no injuries on Amber. The cops claim Amber said nothing had happened. 
 
 Again, the new filings were in connection with his defamation lawsuit against The Sun.

 Lawton/FilmMagic UFC fighter Tito Ortiz and porn queen Jenna Jameson pose for photos in February. 
 
 Porn queen Jenna Jameson's baby daddy was charged Monday with beating her up at the Southern California home they share. 
 
 Ultimate Fighting Championship star Tito Ortiz, 35, father of Jameson's 13-month-old twin boys, was hauled off to jail in handcuffs from the Huntington Beach house and charged with felony domestic violence. 
 
 Jameson, 36, said she was ""completely shocked"" that the 6-foot-3, 210-pound Ortiz would assault her. 
 
 ""Tito is a loving, sweet man. I've always supported him,"" said the former XXX-rated leading lady. ""For him to lash out at me is shocking."" 
 
 Asked if she was going to press charges, the buxom beauty responded, ""Oh, yeah!"" 
 
 ""You have to press charges,"" said Jameson, who is 5-feet-7 and weighs 110 pounds. ""This isn't something you can just get over."" 
 
 Jameson's father, Lawrence Massoli, an ex-Las Vegas cop, said his daughter immediately got a restraining order against Ortiz. 
 
 As three cops placed Ortiz in the back of a squad car, the mixed martial arts brawler denied being abusive to Jameson. 
 
 ""No,"" he said curtly when asked by a TMZ.com cameraman if he was being arrested for domestic violence. 
 
 Massoli said he was at the house, which Ortiz owns, when the abuse occurred and called 911. 
 
 Jameson, with her right arm wrapped in a medical brace, said it was the first time Ortiz hit her. 
 
 ""I feel completely betrayed,"" Jameson told reporters outside the house. 
 
 Asked about her injuries, she said, ""My arm's okay. I'm tough."" 
 
 She declined to disclose what sparked the abuse, but said, ""It wasn't minor."" 
 
 Police went to the two-story Spanish-style home after getting Massoli's 911 call of a ""disturbance"" at 9:53 a.m. 
 
 Ortiz, a former Ultimate Fighting light heavyweight champ, was booked at the Huntington Beach Jail. He was expected to be released last night on $50,000 bail. 
 
 The charges have jeopardized his career. ""We're going to be fair, but we could cut him,"" Ultimate Fighting boss Dan White told TMZ. ""Other than going on a killing spree, being accused of domestic violence is the worst thing you can have going for you."" 
 
 Jameson - the star of such porn classics as ""I Dream of Jenna"" and ""Hell on Heels"" - has her own home in Hollywood, but spends most of her time at Ortiz's house. 
 
 Ortiz and Jameson began dating after meeting on MySpace.com in 2006, shortly after she divorced her second husband, on-screen sex partner Jay Grdina. 
 
 In January 2008, Jameson announced she was retiring from porn performing, but would continue to run her $30 million-a-year Internet porn company, ClubJenna.com. 
 
 Jameson gave birth March 16, 2009, to Ortiz's twin sons, Jesse Jameson and Journey Jette. She revealed this month she is launching a singing career.

 Shocked members of a Florida church gathered Monday to mourn the loss of eight people who died hours earlier when their church van crashed in rural Southwest Florida. 
 
 Ten other people were injured in the crash of the van, from the Independent Haitian Assembly of God church in Fort Pierce. 
 
 ""This is very sad — a tragedy,"" Philippe Dorce, who said his father-in-law and a cousin died in the crash, told the Palm Beach Post. 
 
 Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Greg Bueno said the van ran through a stop sign early Monday before crossing all lanes of US 27 near Moore Haven, near the banks of Lake Okeechobee. The van continued onto a grassy shoulder, crashing into a steep canal partially filled with water, Bueno said. 
 
 ""They didn't see that stop sign. They shot right through it,"" Glades County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Duane Pottorff told the Associate Press. ""It was a sad evening."" 
 
 The group was returning to Fort Pierce from a weekend Palm Sunday revival in Fort Myers. Moore Haven, 55 miles east of Fort Myers, is about 80 miles southwest of Fort Pierce, which is located on Florida's east coast. 
 
 The driver, 58-year-old Volsaint Marsaille, and seven passengers were confirmed dead. The other 10 passengers were taken to four local hospitals, with three in a serious condition. A four-year-old passenger was in a stable condition, he said. The injured ranged in age from 4 to 89.

 STRASBOURG, France (AP) — The man authorities say killed three people near a Christmas market in Strasbourg died Tuesday in a shootout with police at the end of two-day manhunt, French authorities said. 
 
 Paris prosecutor's office, which handles terror cases in France, formally identified the man killed in the eastern French city as 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, a Strasbourg-born man with a long history of convictions for various crimes, including robberies. Chekatt also had been on a watch list of potential extremists. 
 
 The news came a couple of hours after Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said a man believed to be Chekatt had been gunned down during a police operation in the city's Neudorf neighborhood. 
 
 Castaner said the suspect opened fire on police Thursday night when officials tried to arrest him. 
 
 ""The moment they tried to arrest him, he turned around and opened fired. They replied,"" Castaner said. 
 
 A local police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said the man who shot at police was armed with a pistol and a knife. 
 
 Strasbourg mayor Roland Ries said police acted on a top from a woman. Local police officer Emmanuel Georg told BFM TV station that three police officers patrolling the neighborhood tried to intercept a suspect corresponding to Chekatt's description as he was about to enter a building. 
 
 ""He opened fired, they responded and managed to shoot him down,"" Georg said. 
 
 A witness to the shootout said he heard shots and rushed to the window to see what was happening. He closed the shutters when he spotted the cornered suspect across the street. 
 
 ""I was very afraid for my children, I told them to go away, and I went to the side,"" Cem Akcakaya told The Associated Press. 
 
 After it was over, he said he saw the man motionless on his back on the pavement, his left arm askew. 
 
 Chekatt is accused of killing three people and wounding 13 on Tuesday night. Castaner said earlier Thursday that three of the injured had been released from hospital and three others were fighting for their lives. 
 
 More than 700 officers were deployed to find Chekatt, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told CNews television. French authorities said Chekatt had 27 criminal convictions, receiving the first at age 13. 
 
 The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online, said the Islamic State group's Amaq news agency was claiming the gunman as a ""soldier"" of the group, although IS claims of responsibility have often been considered opportunistic in the past. 
 
 Security forces, including the elite Raid squad, spent hours searching in the Neudorf neighborhood on Thursday based on ""supposition only"" that Chekatt could have been hiding in a building nearby two days after the attack, a French police official said. Chekatt grew up in Neudorf. 
 
 Chekatt allegedly shouted ""God is great!"" in Arabic and sprayed gunfire from a security zone near the Christmas market Tuesday evening. Authorities said he was wounded during an exchange of fire with security forces and a taxi driver dropped him off in Neudorf after he escaped. 
 
 So far, five people have been arrested and remanded in custody in connection with the investigation, including Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers. 
 
 The Paris prosecutor's office said the fifth, who was arrested Thursday at an undisclosed location, was a member of Chekatt's ""entourage"" but not a family member. 
 
 France has raised its three-stage threat index to the highest level since the attack and deployed 1,800 additional soldiers across the country to help patrol streets and secure crowded events. 
 
 Residents of Strasbourg's Neudorf neighborhood expressed relief. 
 
 ""Everybody's quite happy that the killer has been finally shot. I think now, the city and life can keep going on in Strasbourg,"" resident Pierre Plasse said. 
 
 The people who died in the attack included a Thai tourist, 45-year-old Anupong Suebsamarn, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry. Five of the wounded were in serious condition, the prefecture of the Strasbourg region said. 
 
 French President Emmanuel Macron was in Brussels on Thursday for a European Union summit. EU leaders held a minute of silence for the latest victims of a mass shooting in France. 
 
 Hundreds of people gathered in Strasbourg's 500-year-old cathedral Thursday evening to mourn and seek comfort. 
 
 ""Evil does not prevail,"" Archbishop Luc Ravel said. ""And the message of Christmas has not been contradicted but rather confirmed by Tuesday's dramatic night: Evil and good are both there, but in the end the good will have last word."" 
 
 Strasbourg's usually busy streets were eerily empty Thursday morning, with a heavy police and military presence. Some lit candles and brought flowers to a makeshift memorial at the site of the attack.

74,"Study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, tweeting about vaccines 
 
 Bots and Russian trolls spread misinformation about vaccines on Twitter to sow division and distribute malicious content before and during the American presidential election, according to a new study. 
 
 Scientists at George Washington University, in Washington DC, made the discovery while trying to improve social media communications for public health workers, researchers said. Instead, they found trolls and bots skewing online debate and upending consensus about vaccine safety. 
 
 The study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, as well as marketing and malware bots, tweeting about vaccines. 
 
 
 
 Russian trolls played both sides, the researchers said, tweeting pro- and anti-vaccine content in a politically charged context. 
 
 “These trolls seem to be using vaccination as a wedge issue, promoting discord in American society,” Mark Dredze, a team member and professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins, which was also involved in the study, said. 
 
 “By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases. Viruses don’t respect national boundaries.” 
 
 The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, comes as Europe faces one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, one which has been partly attributed to falling vaccination rates. In the first six months of 2018, there were 41,000 cases of measles across the continent, more than in the entirety of 2017. Meanwhile, the rate of children not receiving vaccines for non-medical reasons is climbing in the US. 
 
 “The vast majority of Americans believe vaccines are safe and effective, but looking at Twitter gives the impression that there is a lot of debate,” said David Broniatowski, an assistant professor in George Washington’s School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
 
 “It turns out that many anti-vaccine tweets come from accounts whose provenance is unclear. These might be bots, human users or ‘cyborgs’ – hacked accounts that are sometimes taken over by bots. Although it’s impossible to know exactly how many tweets were generated by bots and trolls, our findings suggest that a significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas.” 
 
 Russian trolls appeared to link vaccination to controversial issues in the US. Their vaccine-related content made appeals to God, or argued about race, class and animal welfare, researchers said. Often, the tweets targeted the legitimacy of the US government. 
 
 
 
 “Did you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS,” read one Russian troll tweet. Another said: “#VaccinateUS You can’t fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I’m for #vaccination!” 
 
 “Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated anti-vaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord,” researchers concluded. “Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination.”

 Researchers examined a random sample of 1.7m tweets collected between July 2014 and September 2017 – the height of the American presidential campaign that led to Donald Trump’s victory. To identify bots, researchers compared the rate at which normal users tweeted about vaccines with the rate at which bots and trolls did so. 
 
 “We started looking at the Russian trolls, because that data set became available in January,” said Broniatowski. “One of the first things that came out was they tweet about vaccines way more often than the average Twitter user.” 
 
 Broniatowski said trolls tweeted about vaccines about 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, or about once every 550 tweets, versus every 12,000 tweets for human accounts. 
 
 Researchers found different kinds of bots spread different kinds of misinformation. So-called “content polluters” used anti-vaccine messages as bait to entice their followers to click on advertisements and links to malicious websites. 
 
 The study comes as social media companies struggle to clean their houses of misinformation. In February, Twitter deleted 3,800 accounts linked to the Russian government-backed Internet Research Agency, the same group researchers at George Washington examined. In April, Facebook removed 135 accounts linked to the same organization. 
 
 This week, Facebook removed another 650 fake accounts linked to Russia and Iran meant to spread misinformation. Researchers did not study Facebook, though it remains a hub of anti-vaccination activity. 
 
 “To me it’s actually impressive how well-organized and sophisticated the anti-vax movement has become,” said Dr Peter Hotez, the director of the Texas children’s hospital center for vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, and the father of an autistic child. Hotez, who maintains an active Twitter presence, said he struggled to identify whether Twitter accounts were human or bots. 
 
 “There are clearly some well-known anti-vax activists that I know to look out for and I know to block or to mute, but that’s a minority,” said Hotez. “A lot of it just seems to come out of nowhere, and I’m always surprised by that.” 
 
 Q&A What is net neutrality? Show Hide Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) treat everyone’s data equally – whether that’s an email from your mother, a bank transfer or a streamed episode of The Handmaid’s Tale. It means that ISPs don’t get to choose which data is sent more quickly, and which sites get blocked or throttled (for example, slowing the delivery of a TV show because it is streamed by a video company that competes with a subsidiary of the ISP) and who has to pay extra. For this reason, some have described net neutrality as the “first amendment of the internet”. 
 
 
 
 One of the most striking findings, Broniatowski said, was an apparent attempt by Russian trolls to Astroturf a vaccine debate using the hashtag #VaccinateUS. Accounts identified as controlled by the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm backed by the Russian government, were almost exclusively responsible for content emerging under #VaccinateUS. 
 
 Some of the Russian trolls even specifically used a hashtag associated with Andrew Wakefield, the discredited former physician who published fraudulent papers linking vaccines with autism, such as #Vaxxed and #CDCWhistleblower.

 The Guardian requested comment from Twitter and was referred to a blogpost in which the company said its “focus is increasingly on proactively identifying problematic accounts”, and that its system “identified and challenged” more than 9.9m potential spam accounts a week in May 2018. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why has there been a measles outbreak in Europe? 
 
 Social media bots and Russian trolls have been spreading disinformation about vaccines on Twitter to create social discord and distribute malware, US researchers say. 
 
 Troll accounts that had attempted to influence the US election had also been tweeting about vaccines, a study says. 
 
 Many posted both pro- and anti-vaccination messages to create ""false equivalency"", the study found. 
 
 It examined thousands of tweets sent between 2014 and 2017. 
 
 Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a ""wedge issue"", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University. 
 
 ""By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases,"" he said. 
 
 Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said cases of measles in Europe had hit a record high, with experts blaming this surge in infections on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated. 
 
 In the US, the number of children being exempted from immunisation for religious or philosophical reasons is also rising, research published in June found. 
 
 While a majority of Americans believed vaccines were safe and effective, looking at Twitter gave a different impression and suggested that there was a lot of debate about the issue, the disinformation study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health, said. 
 
 ""A significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas,"" said David Broniatowski from George Washington University. 
 
 The researchers reviewed more than 250 tweets about vaccination from accounts linked to the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA). In February the agency was named in a US indictment over alleged election meddling. 
 
 The IRA tweets used polarising language and linked vaccination to controversial statements about race, class and government legitimacy, the researchers said. 
 
 One tweet casting doubt on vaccines that was cited in the study read: ""Did you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS"". 
 
 Another that argued for vaccinations said: ""#VaccinateUS You can't fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I'm for #vaccination!"" 
 
 Meanwhile less sophisticated ""content polluters"" - bot accounts that distribute malware, unsolicited commercial content and disruptive materials - shared anti-vaccination messages much more frequently than average Twitter users, using them as ""bait"" to get people to click on links to malicious websites. 
 
 Social media companies are struggling to find ways to combat disinformation on their platforms. 
 
 Earlier this week Facebook and Twitter said they had suspended or removed accounts linked to Iran and Russia over ""inauthentic"" or ""manipulating"" behaviour. 
 
 In July Twitter was reported to have shut down up to 70m fake and suspicious accounts. 
 
 Health cost of vaccination 'debate' 
 
 Despite science overwhelmingly and indisputably advocating in favour of immunisation, a growing number of parents around the world are resisting medical advice by going their own way. 
 
 Some base their decision on discredited research 20 years ago that erroneously linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) to autism. 
 
 But health officials say the number of people getting the disease measles is rising because of a fall in vaccinations. 
 
 In Europe more than 41,000 people were infected with measles in the first six months of 2018 - nearly double the number of cases for the whole of last year - leading to 37 deaths. 
 
 High rates of measles were seen in Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia and Greece. 
 
 In the US the number of children being exempted from vaccines is also rising. 
 
 In Italy, the upper house of parliament has voted through legislation to abolish the law that makes vaccination mandatory for children before they start school. The amendment will mean parents of unvaccinated children will no longer face fines. ||||| “Don’t get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it.” 
 
 “Do you still treat your kids with leaves? No? And why don’t you #vaccinate them? It’s medicine!” 
 
 With messages like those, Russian internet trolls meddling in the 2016 presidential election also lashed out at Americans debating the safety of vaccines, a new study has found. 
 
 But instead of picking a side, researchers said, the trolls and bots they programmed hurled insults at both pro- and anti-vaccine advocates. Their only intent, the study concluded, seemed to be to raise the level of hostility. 
 
 “You see this pattern,” said David A. Broniatowski , a computer engineer at George Washington University and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. “On guns, or race, these accounts take opposite sides in lots of debates. They’re about sowing discord.”","– You might think twice about heading to Twitter or Facebook to read about vaccinations. ""A significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas,"" says George Washington University's David Broniatowski, author of a new study calling out Russian trolls for seeking to polarize Americans on the issue during 2016 election meddling. Already known to have stirred up issues relating to guns and race, Russia-linked Twitter accounts sent more than 250 tweets offering a pro- or anti-vaccine stance between 2014 and 2017, the BBC reports, citing the study published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. Those identified as trolls tweeted about vaccines 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, according to the study, which notes that #VaccinateUS was ""uniquely identified with Russian troll accounts associated with the [Kremlin's] Internet Research Agency,"" per the Guardian and New York Times. ""You can't fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I'm for #vaccination!"" one such tweet read. ""Don’t get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it,"" read another. ""By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases,"" says researcher Mark Dredze.

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Central Intelligence Agency was involved in a spying operation against Germany that led to the alleged recruitment of a German intelligence official and has prompted renewed outrage in Berlin, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
 
 CIA Director John Brennan has asked to brief key members of the U.S. Congress on the matter, which threatens a new rupture between Washington and a close European ally, one of the officials said. 
 
 It was unclear if and when Brennan's briefing to U.S. lawmakers would take place. The CIA declined any comment on the matter. 
 
 The office of Germany's Federal Prosecutor, based in the western city of Karlsruhe, late last week issued a statement saying that a 31-year old man had been arrested on suspicion of being a foreign spy, and that investigations were continuing. The statement offered no further details. 
 
 German politicians have said that the suspect, an employee of the country's foreign intelligence service, admitted passing to an American contact details concerning a German parliamentary committee's investigation of alleged U.S. eavesdropping disclosed by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency. 
 
 The U.S. officials who confirmed the CIA's role spoke on condition of anonymity, and offered no further details. 
 
 White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined comment on the dispute. ||||| A suspected double agent under arrest in Germany has been spying for the CIA for two years, German intelligence officials investigating the case now believe. 
 
 “All the evidence suggests that he was working for the Americans,” an unnamed senior security official has told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. 
 
 The country's top security official has demanded a full American response to German investigations. ""I expect everyone now to assist quickly in clearing up the accusations - and quick and clear statements, from the USA too,"" Thomas de Maiziere, the Interior minister said. 
 
 Germany's Foreign Ministry summoned the America ambassador on Friday but German authorities have confirmed only that a 31-year-old man is under arrest. 
 
 The first indications that investigators believe a confession by the arrested man is true. If the suspicions against him are confirmed, the case could cause grave damage to US-German relations. 
 
 The arrested man, who is severely disabled, worked in the Foreign Relations department of Germany’s BND intelligence service, where he had access to classified documents and information about agents abroad. 
 
 For the last two years, he has been sending documents to the Americans electronically once a week, according to Bild newspaper. 
 
 In a damning piece of evidence, investigators said they had found an encrypted communication programme hidden on his computer. 
 
 The hidden programme was disguised as a weather app, and activated by searching for a weather forecast for New York. 
 
 The arrested man was able to carry on most communications electronically, but met with an American contact in Austria on two or three occasions, when he received payments of €25,000 in cash. 
 
 Other reports said German intelligence asked their American counterparts for help unmasking their own mole – and the Americans remained silent. 
 
 The man was caught after an anonymous email he sent offering to sell classified information to the Russians was intercepted. 
 
 German intelligence officials posing as Russians tried to entice the man to a meeting, but he refused. 
 
 The Germans then requested American help tracing the sender of the email, but they got not reply. In the meantime, German intelligence successfully identified the man. 
 
 Convinced they were hunting down a Russian agent, they were astonished when he confessed he to spying for the Americans. 
 
 News of the arrest has been greeted with fury in a Germany still reeling from the revelation that the NSA spied on Chancellor Angela 
 
 Merkel’s phone calls, and American officials have conceded that it threatens to undo all their efforts to repair relations. 
 
 Mrs Merkel has yet to comment publicly on the case, but business leaders accomanying her on a trip to China told Spiegel she was “surprised and stunned”. 
 
 Germany’s president, Joachim Gauck, has given an angry TV interview in which he accuses the US of “playing games with our friendship” and says if it is proved the arrested man spied for the Americans, Germany must “say enough is enough, for once”. 
 
 Germany is to demand all joint intelligence staff at the US embassy in Berlin be replaced, according to Bild, and has not ruled out insisting on a change of ambassador.","– The CIA is owning up to involvement in a spying operation that threatens to rankle US-German relations yet again, two US officials tell Reuters.

 AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — The U.S. will reach its target this week of taking in 10,000 Syrian war refugees in a year-old resettlement program, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan said Sunday, after meeting families headed to California and Virginia. 
 
 The resettlement program has emerged as an issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, with Republican nominee Donald Trump alleging displaced Syrians pose a potential security threat. 
 
 Alice Wells, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, said Sunday that keeping Americans safe and taking in some of the world's most vulnerable people are not mutually exclusive. 
 
 ""Refugees are the most thoroughly screened category of travelers to the United States, and Syrian refugees are subject to even greater scrutiny,"" she said. 
 
 Wells said the target of resettling 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S. in the 2016 fiscal year will be reached Monday, as several hundred Syrians depart from Jordan over 24 hours. 
 
 The Jouriyeh family, which attended Sunday's short ceremony, is headed to San Diego, California. 
 
 Nadim Fawzi Jouriyeh, 49, a former construction worker from the war-ravaged Syrian city of Homs, said he feels ""fear and joy, fear of the unknown and our new lives, but great joy for our children's lives and future."" 
 
 Jouriyeh, who suffers from heart problems, will be traveling with his wife, Rajaa, 42, and their four children. Their oldest son, 14-year-old Mohammed, said he is eager to sign up for school in San Diego and hopes to study medicine one day. 
 
 The resettlement program focuses on the most vulnerable refugees, including those who were subjected to violence or torture or are sick. 
 
 Close to 5 million Syrians have fled civil war since 2011. Most struggle to survive in tough conditions in neighboring countries, including Jordan, which hosts close to 660,000 Syrian refugees. 
 
 Only a small percentage of Syrian refugees have been resettled to third countries. Instead, donor countries are trying to invest more in job creation and education for refugees in regional host countries to encourage them to stay there instead of moving onward, including to Europe. 
 
 Wells said the U.S. has taken in more refugees from around the world over the years than all other nations combined. ||||| AMSTERDAM — On April 30, 1941, a Jewish man here in Amsterdam wrote a desperate letter to an American friend, pleading for help emigrating to the United States.

 A volunteer found that plea for help in 2005 when she was sorting old World War II refugee files in New York City. It looked like countless other files, until she saw the children’s names. 
 
 “Oh my God,” she said, “this is the Anne Frank file.” Along with the letter were many others by Otto Frank, frantically seeking help to flee Nazi persecution and obtain a visa to America, Britain or Cuba — but getting nowhere because of global indifference to Jewish refugees.

 This was just posted by @theanonmessage, a twitter account affiliated with Anonymous’ Operation Ferguson, a member of which I interviewed last night. According to @theanonmessage, this recording contains audio excerpts from St. Louis County police dispatch over several hours on August 9, 2014, the day Michael Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer. The dispatcher starts talking about the Brown shooting around the 10-minute mark, while intermittently handling other calls. See below the recording for an updating list of interesting moments, with time stamps included. 
 
 If you want to try to decipher the dispatch codes, here’s a dictionary for that. 
 
 9:35: “Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control . . .” 
 
 10:58: “Now they have a large group gathering there, she doesn’t know any further. . .” 
 
 11:20: “We just got another call stating it was an officer-involved shooting . . .” 
 
 11:30: “Be advised, this information came from the news . . .” 
 
 11:55: “We’re just getting information from the news and we just called Ferguson back again and they don’t know anything about it . . .” 
 
 20:00: “. . .destruction of property . . .” 
 
 21:55: “They are requesting more cars. Do you want me to send more of your cars?” 
 
 43:55: “Attention all cars, be advised that in reference to the call 2947 Canfield Drive, we are switching over to the riot channel at this time . . .” 
 
 Update, 4:40 p.m. ET: I tried to verify the dispatch recordings with St. Louis County Police but their media contact, Brian Shelman, did not answer the phone and his voicemail was full. 
 
 Update 2, 5:05 p.m. ET: Mashable is confirming that the St. Louis County Police Department is “aware of this and currently investigating.” 
 
 Update 3, 6:05 p.m. ET: A twitter follower of mine points out that the dispatch recording probably comes from Broadcastify, a database of public safety radio audio streams that’s available to anyone who pays for a subscription. It’s “far from a hack,” he says. ||||| Computer hackers associated with the hacktivist group Anonymous released a recording on YouTube Wednesday that they claim are audio files from a St. Louis County Police dispatch recorded during the Aug. 9 shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. 
 
 The tape appears to be from St. Louis County dispatch — but the officer who fired the shots works for Ferguson's police department. Discussion of the shooting begins at 11:26, when a dispatcher mentions hearing about the incident ""on the news,"" and at minute 44, which contains audio from 1:35 p.m. - 2:05 p.m., the dispatcher says ""we are switching over to the riot channel."" 
 
 It's likely any chatter regarding the actual shooting will be found in the Ferguson Police Department's audio dispatches. Those have yet to be released — Ferguson's Police Chief Thomas Jackson says the 911 tapes were still being processed during a press conference on Wednesday, and apologized that it was taking so long. 
 
 Reached over email, St. Louis Police spokesperson Brian Schellman tells Mashable, ""We are aware of this and are currently investigating it."" 
 
 Asked if he has any indication if they were real, or any clue how they were obtained, Schellman responded, ""That's what our investigators are looking into now. The answer to both of those questions."" 
 
 The St. Louis County Police Department is currently in charge of the shooting's investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting.

 ""We have released these tapes to the public so as they are able to get a sense of the atmosphere the moments before and the hours after Mike Brown was shot,"" an Anonymous spokesperson associated with the leaks told Mashable. 
 
 ""The public needs to understand that there were faults in the response to Mike Brown's shooting. For example, crowd control was requested but there was no mention of a shooting. The dispatcher was notified from a caller and Ferguson PD said they had no idea what was going on. This is all in the tapes,"" the spokesperson said. 
 
 The group explains the scanner audio, which is almost two hours long, was lightly edited to remove quiet periods in its description on YouTube: 
 
 We are Anonymous. These files compiled in this video contains audio of St. Louis police dispatch from the date of August 9th 2014, the day Mike Brown was murdered by a Ferguson PD officer. We have released these tapes to the public so as they are able to get a sense of the atmosphere the moments before and the hours after Mike Brown was shot. These raw audio files have been compiled and long quiet moments have been cut down. Time stamps are available within the video. 
 
 The group had promised to release the tapes on Wednesday, but ran into technical problems uploading the tape. 
 
 ""We apologize for the delay, file size is rather large. Continue to stay tuned in, we will notify you immediately,"" the Twitter account @TheAnonMessage message tweeted just after 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. ""It's not my fault YouTube servers take forever to process."" 
 
 The website of the St. Louis suburb has also been experiencing cyberattacks since the shooting, but Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said on Wednesday that those won't sway him into releasing the officer's name who shot Brown. 
 
 The officer has not been identified, though Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer had been with the Ferguson police force for six years. 
 
 Jackson said someone burrowed into the website and shut it down for much of Monday, two days after the 18-year-old Brown was killed. Brown's death has stoked racial tensions, violent protests, and looting, along with calls for police to release the offending officer's name so his background could be reviewed.

 Anonymous has pledged to tamper with the city's computers if the name wasn't released. But Jackson said releasing the information could endanger the officer, who has received numerous death threats. 
 
 Jackson said he was unaware of whether the hackers obtained any personal information about police officers from its website. Ferguson, a predominantly black city of roughly 20,000 residents, is about 8 miles northwest of St. Louis. 
 
 Investigators have released very few details about the shooting; the events that unfolded on Saturday are still in dispute. Officials only said that a scuffle began after an officer asked Brown and another man to get out of the street, and that the officer's weapon fired at some point inside a patrol car. Witnesses say Brown had his hands raised when the officer repeatedly shot him.

 A team of officers wearing riot gear and toting shields stood about 100 feet from the protesters. 
 
 Just after 9 p.m., cops issued several warnings over a loudspeaker, saying, “You are being ordered to leave now! If you don’t leave peacefully, there will be arrests.” 
 
 Someone in the defiant crowd threw a bottle at the police line. Cops responded by firing tear gas canisters and flash grenades that sparked and emitted ear-splitting booms. 
 
 “We’re not dogs, so what the hell you’ve got those whipping sticks for?” one man shouted at police. “Because you want to whip us like dogs.”

 Gunshots were also heard, apparently fired by protesters at the police. One bullet whizzed by the head of a Daily News reporter. Tear gas billowed over W. Florissant Ave., Ferguson’s main drag, where the protesters gathered before sunset.

 “It was tense,” said Wesley Lowery, the Washington Post reporter who was detained, adding that police slammed him against a soda machine and slapped plastic cuffs on him. Lowery and Ryan Reilly, the Huffington Post reporter, were both released without being charged. 
 
 Earlier Wednesday, protesters gathered in front of the QuickTrip on W. Florissant, a store that was looted and set ablaze on Sunday. 
 
 “The whole damn system is guilty as hell!” the crowd chanted at cops standing behind their shields. SWAT officers stood atop two armored vehicles and pointed .40-caliber automatic weapons mounted on tripods at the demonstrators. 
 
 The tense standoff came after a hacker collective posted recordings of police radio chatter in the moments after Brown’s death on the Web on Wednesday.

 Moments after the unidentified Ferguson cop killed Brown, a county police dispatcher reported an urgent request from an officer in trouble. 
 
 “Need assistance with crowd control,” she said in the recordings. A short time time later, the dispatcher reported an “officer-involved shooting” but added, “Be advised. This information came from the news.” 
 
 Thirty minutes later, it was all hands on deck. 
 
 “Attention, all cars. Be advised we are switching over to the riot channel,” she said.

 The apparent confusion was revealed in recordings that Anonymous obtained and posted Wednesday. The effort is part of the hacker group’s “Operation Ferguson” to make sure that Brown’s death is investigated. 
 
 The group is also trying to unmask the white officer who fired the fatal shots. Chief Jackson has refused to identify the cop because of threats against his life. 
 
 The tapes were unveiled on the same day that Brown’s pal Dorian Johnson — who claims the teen was “shot like an animal” after the cop told him to get on the sidewalk — met with police and FBI investigators. 
 
 Johnson said the cop grabbed Brown around the neck and tried to pull him through the window of his cruiser. 
 
 “He says, ‘I’ll shoot,’” said Johnson. “A second later, the gun went off and he let go. That’s how we were able to run at the same time.” 
 
 Johnson said he ducked behind a car, but one of the officer’s shots hit Brown in the back. 
 
 “My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting. Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area. 
 
 “It was just horrible to watch,” Johnson said.

Photograph: Brook Lapping/Kessler Prod/BBC 
 
 Israel has made public a decades-old handwritten plea for clemency from Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann for his role in the Holocaust, dated two days before he was executed. 
 
 In the request, written after he was brought to Israel in 1960, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death, Eichmann says the Israeli court overstated his role in organising the logistics of Hitler’s Final Solution, which involved the extermination of 6 million Jews. 
 
 
 
 President Reuven Rivlin presented the previously unreleased letter, which was written to then president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, at a ceremony to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
 
 Hitler’s world may not be so far away | Timothy Snyder Read more 
 
 “There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders,” the presidency quoted Eichmann’s letter as saying. 
 
 “I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty,” the German wrote. 
 
 “I am not able to recognise the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out.” 
 
 The letter was signed and dated: “Adolf Eichmann Jerusalem, May 29, 1962.” 
 
 He was hanged at about midnight on 31 May. 
 
 Eichmann, one of the main organisers of the Holocaust, escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp after the second world war and fled to Argentina in 1950, where he lived under a pseudonym until he was snatched by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires in May 1960 and smuggled into Israel. 
 
 The ability of the security services to bring him to justice was a source of pride for the Jewish state, and Rivlin referred to the trial as a momentous moment in Israel’s history. 
 
 “In the first years after the Holocaust, the people in Israel were busy rebuilding and founding an independent state,” he said. “The renewed Israeli society was not in the mindset to, or able to, remember. 
 
 “The Eichmann trial broke the dam of silence. The ability of the young Jewish state to capture the Nazi murderer afforded a basic sense of security to the survivors of the Holocaust.” 
 
 Dismissing Eichmann’s claims to be just a bureaucrat, Rivlin said: “The people who suffered from Eichmann’s weakness were not given a moment of grace.” 
 
 Israel and its allies have continued to use their resources across the globe to pursue those responsible for carrying out the Holocaust, even though the majority of perpetrators are now close to death. 
 
 On Tuesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Center – named after the famous Nazi hunter – produced a list of 10 alleged Nazis who could be prosecuted in 2016. Of the 10, four have trial dates already slated in Germany this year. Among them is Helma Kissner, who served as a radio operator in the Auschwitz death camp for four months in July 1944. 
 
 Efraim Zuroff, the Jerusalem director of the centre, said it would continue to chase every remaining perpetrator as “we owe it to the victims”. 
 
 “The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of the killers. Old age should not afford protection to people that committed such heinous crimes,” he told AFP. “The trials send a powerful message about the significance of the Holocaust.” 
 
 As the number of second world war Nazis alive diminishes, Zuroff said his centre was also seeking to focus on historical accuracy – with strands of different societies in Europe keen to play down their role in the killings. 
 
 The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, in a statement on Tuesday, warned that antisemitism was again growing in Europe. 
 
 “Even respected western opinion leaders have become afflicted with hatred for the Jewish people and the Jewish state,” Netanyahu said, without giving names. “The obsession with the Jews – the fixation on the Jewish state – defies any other rational explanation.” 
 
 Other documents presented at Wednesday’s commemoration, in the presence of Holocaust survivors, included requests for clemency from Eichmann’s wife Vera and his five brothers, along with Ben-Zvi’s letter to his justice minister rejecting the appeals. 
 
 Also in the collection, recently digitised by the presidential archives, are a transcript of Eichmann’s defence counsel’s supreme court appeal, the handwritten opinion of justice minister Dov Yosef, and a note by prosecutor Gideon Hausner for his opening address.

 In the petition, written after he was brought to Israel in 1960, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death the following year, Eichmann says that the Israeli court overstated his role in organizing the logistics of Hitler’s “Final Solution,” which involved the extermination of six million Jews. 
 
 “There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders,” Rivlin’s office quotes the letter as saying. 
 
 “I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty,” he adds. 
 
 “I am not able to recognize the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out.” 
 
 The letter was signed and dated: “Adolf Eichmann Jerusalem, May 29, 1962.” 
 
 He was hanged overnight May 31 and cremated hours later. His ashes were scattered outside the borders of the State of Israel in the Mediterranean Sea. He was the only person ever executed by the Jewish state. 
 
 Eichmann had escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp after World War II and fled to Argentina in 1950, where he lived under a pseudonym until he was snatched by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires in May 1960 and smuggled to Israel. 
 
 Other documents to be presented at Wednesday’s commemoration in the presence of Holocaust survivors, include requests for clemency from Eichmann’s wife Vera and his five brothers, and Ben-Zvi’s letter to his justice minister rejecting the appeals. 
 
 Former MK Rafi Eitan, who was in charge of the Mossad operation to capture Eichmann, will also attend the ceremony along with members of the family of the late Gideon Hausner who was prosecutor in the case. 
 
 Also in the collection, recently digitized by the presidential archives, are a transcript of Eichmann’s defense counsel’s Supreme Court appeal, the handwritten opinion of justice minister Dov Yosef, and a note by prosecutor Gideon Hausner for his opening address. 
 
 Below is the full text of Eichmann’s letter to Ben-Zvi in translation, provided by the Rivlin’s office in Jerusalem. 
 
 To: 
 
 Mr. President, 
 
 I add myself to the request of my defence counsel, and allow myself to state further the following matters. 
 
 In their judgement of me, the judges made a fundamental mistake in that they are not able to empathise with the time and situation in which I found myself during the war years. The mistake was caused by the fact that at the time of my judgement, I was presented with a number of documents which without being seen in connection with the general material of the orders, must give an incorrect picture. 
 
 It is not true that I was personally of such a high rank as to be able to persecute, or that I myself was a persecutor in the pursuit of the Jews, in the face of such an abundant rule it is clear the judges in their ruling ignored the fact that I never served in such a high position as required to be involved independently in such decisive responsibilities. Nor did I give any order in my own name, but only ever acted ‘by order of’. 
 
 Even had I been as the judges assessed the driving, zealous, force in the persecution of the Jews, such a thing would have been evident in my promotion and other awards. Yet I received no such advantages. 
 
 It is also incorrect that I was never influenced by human emotions. 
 
 Specifically under the impression of the unspeakable horrors which I witnessed, I immediately requested a transfer to a different post. Similarly, I revealed of my own will during the police investigation, horrors which had been till then unknown in order to help establish the undisputable truth. 
 
 I declare once again, as I did in the presence of the court: I detest as the greatest of crimes the horrors which were perpetrated against the Jews and think it right that the initiators of these terrible deeds will stand trial before the law now and in the future. 
 
 Notwithstanding there is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders. I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty. 
 
 I am not able to recognise the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr. President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out. 
 
 Adolf Eichmann 
 
 Jerusalem, 29.5.62 ||||| High-ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann requested a pardon from Israel's president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi two days before was hanged to death, rare documents released in honor of International Holocaust Remembrance Day showed on Wednesday. 
 
 Eichmann made the request after being found guilty of 15 charges, including crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

 The document is one of several released ahead of an event scheduled for Wednesday at the President's Residence. Among the other artifacts are Ben-Zvi's letter rejecting Eichmann's request and the pages on which chief prosecutor Gideon Hausner wrote the famous line invoking ""six million accusers"" in the trial. 
 
 
 
 Adolf Eichmann during his trial 
 
 
 
 ""The judges made a critical mistake when assessing my personality, because they cannot place themselves in the time and situation I was in during the war years,"" Eichmann wrote to Israel's second president. ""It is untrue that I was such an important personage that I could oversee or would independently oversee the persecution of the Jews."" Eichmann argued that the judges ignored his claim that he ""never served in such a high-ranking position that would have involved such decisive and independent authorities."" 
 
 
 
 
 
 The war criminal, who was among those most involved in carrying out the Holocaust, further wrote: ""I also never gave any orders in my name, but always operated according to orders. Had I been, as the judges assume, the fanatical driving force in the persecution of the Jews, this should have been reflected in a promotion and other rewards, but I was never granted any benefit. A line must be drawn between the leaders who are responsible and people like me, who were forced to be tools by the leadership. I was not in charge of things, and therefore I do not feel that I am guilty. And I ask of you, honorable president, to use your right of pardon and order that this death sentence not be carried out."" 
 
 
 
 Presiding Judges Yitzhak Raveh, Benjamin Halevi, and Moshe Landau 
 
 Vera Eichmann, the notorious Nazi's wife, also wrote to Ben-Tzi with a request for a pardon ""as a fire and mother to four children"". A letter by Eichmann's five brothers was attached to Adolf's letter, which argued that the trial exposed the horrors of the past to the world. ""If people thus attain tolerance and an understanding of brotherhood, the purpose of the trial was achieved. As a conclusion to this worldwide rebuke, an act of mercy would emphasize the altruism of the Jewish people and help it by means of advancing friendship between peoples and races."" 
 
 Eichmann's German attorney, Dr. Robert Servatius, noted in the request that his client was ""an unimportant person who was thrust by fate into political events."" The lawyer added that the court had not taken into account the historical context of events, which he claimed were grounds for overturning the death sentence. ""The condemned did not act out of a position of anti-Semitism, but because he was bound by the bureaucratic coercion system."" 
 
 Ben-Zvi rejected the request in a concise letter. ""After considering the parson requests submitted regarding the Adolf Eichmann case, and after I gave my attention to all the materials available to me, I reached the conclusion that there is no justification for giving Eichmann a pardon or mitigate the punishment passed down by the Jerusalem District Court on December 15, 1961, and which was approved by the Supreme Court on May 29, 1962,"" wrote Ben-Zvi. ""Thus, I am informing you that I have decided to refuse the requests and not use my powers to pardon and reduce punishments in this case."" 
 
 Also revealed was the handwritten text of then-attorney general Gideon Hausner's opening statement. ""When I stand before you, judges of Israel, to lead the prosecution of Adolf Eichmann, I do not stand alone,"" Hausner said in the memorable statement. |With me here are six million accusers. But they cannot rise to their feet and point their finger at the man in the dock with the cry 'J'accuse!' on their lips. For they are now only ashes – ashes piled high on the hills of Auschwitz and the fields of Treblinka and strewn in the forests of Poland. Their graves are scattered throughout Europe. Their blood cries out, but their voice is stilled. Therefore will I be their spokesman. In their name will I unfold this terrible indictment.""","– In all of Israeli history, only one man has been sentenced to death by a civilian court and then executed: Adolf Eichmann. On Wednesday, the country released the Nazi's handwritten plea for clemency, penned two days before he was hanged. The AFP reports the release coincides with International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and quotes, along with the BBC and Ynetnews, from the May 29, 1962, letter, in which Eichmann tries to make the case that he was merely following orders when he implemented the ""Final Solution"": ""[The judges] made a fundamental mistake in that they are not able to empathize with the time and situation in which I found myself during the war years.

80,"A CAR park in a Highland town has been confirmed by archaeologists as the meeting place of a medieval Norse parliament. 
 
 Excavations at the Cromartie Memorial car park in Dingwall uncovered evidence of a mound that archaeologists believe was established in the 11th century as a gathering spot for a Viking parliament, known as a “Thing”. 
 
 Picture: Contributed 
 
 When it was constructed the “Thing” would have been on a man-made islet in the estuary of the River Pefferey, historians claimed. They believe the mound was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty, a powerful Viking earl who died in 1065. 
 
 He is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire. 
 
 It is only the second time a “Thing” site has been uncovered in the UK. Yesterday historians said the discovery would help them learn more about the Norse Vikings, who battled for control of land across the north of Scotland. 
 
 David MacDonald, of Dingwall History Society, which was part of the dig partnership, said that a road, a ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs, were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire. 
 
 He said Thorfinn’s rise to power was aided by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth, possibly against MacBeth’s troops. At the height of his power, Thorfinn became Lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney. 
 
 The origins of the town of Dingwall as a Viking Thing-site had long puzzled historians and archaeologists alike, with many believing it was elsewhere on the Black Isle in Ross-shire. 
 
 But now the results of the archaeological dig, the culmination of Highland Council’s participation as a partner in the EU Northern Periphery International Thing Project, has come up with real answers. 
 
 Mr MacDonald said: “You can call this the official confirmation of the car park being the location of a ‘Thing’. 
 
 “It has been very exciting over the years, but all the historical research points in this direction.” 
 
 In recent times historical investigation identified the Cromartie car park – which contains the burial place and memorial monument of George, first earl of Cromartie, who died in 1714 – as the site of the long lost Moothill of Dingwall, the town’s medieval meeting place. This has now been confirmed as deriving from the Viking Thing-mound. 
 
 A trial trench excavation in the car park in 2012 showed significant radio-carbon datings. 
 
 According to archaeologist Dr Oliver O’Grady, a leading authority on the assembly mounds of Scotland, who was part of the dig : “The excavations have confirmed the presence of important archaeological remains and indicated that the mound was man-made and probably created during the 11th century. 
 
 “The radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider North-east Scotland. 
 
 “The lack of substantial occupation remains or burial activity is also further circumstantial evidence that the mound was created for an assembly site or Thing. 
 
 “The substantial manpower and effort required to create a monument on the scale of the Dingwall mound would also seem in keeping with the establishment of a major regional judicial and administrative centre.” 
 
 Dingwall, which lies at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is a location on a European tourist trail of Thing sites. Funded by the EU, the Thing Sites GeoTour involves Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroes and Isle of Man. ||||| A parking lot in Scotland was once the site of a Viking parliament, new research suggests 
 
 A Viking parliamentary site that dates to the 11th century has been found beneath a parking lot in Scotland. 
 
 The site, located in the town of Dingwall, Scotland, was dubbed a ""Thing"" site, referring to its name in antiquity. Like other Thing sites, this one was likely a place where ancient Norsemen gathered to settle legal disputes, uphold laws and make key political decisions. 
 
 ""It's a fantastic find, really,"" said Oliver J. T. O'Grady, the director of the site's excavations and an archaeologist who runs an archaeological consulting firm called OJT Heritage. ""No one's had dating [information] from a Thing site in Scotland."" 
 
 The Thing 
 
 Historians had long wondered whether Dingwall was a site of a Viking parliamentary gathering known as the Thing because the word Dingwall probably originated from the word thingvellir, which means ""the field of the assembly."" [Fierce Fighters: 7 Secrets of Viking Culture] 
 
 Such Thing sites are scattered from Iceland to Norway to the Shetland Islands, and Norsemen traveled from far and wide to get to the seasonal gatherings, often to settle disputes that would otherwise end in bloodshed. But Things were held mostly at open-air fields, and people only stayed temporarily, leaving relatively few archaeological traces of their presence. 
 
 ""Many archaeologists have said, 'How do you find the archaeology of a bunch of people gathering together?'"" O'Grady told LiveScience. 
 
 O'Grady and his colleagues at The Thing Project, which works on similar sites around Europe, were not deterred, because traces of temporary dwelling booths had turned up at other Thing sites. 
 
 Digging up democracy 
 
 Using historical records, the team found a mound near the inlet of an estuary in Dingwall that was called the moothill, or assembly mound, in the 13th century. Later on, Scottish earls were buried there. In 1947, local authorities bulldozed the top of the mound and turned the area into a parking lot. (Parking lots seem to be rich sources of history in the U.K. — Richard III's skeleton was found underneath a parking lot, as was a medieval knight in Scotland.) 
 
 The team dug a small trench across the mound and used radioactive carbon isotopes, or atoms of carbon with different molecular weights, to date the charcoal found in the soil. (These radioactive isotopes decay at different rates and can be used to date soils and objects.) 
 
 The team found that some of the upper layers of the soil date to the medieval period, likely when it was called the moothill, and contain shards of pottery and fragments of an iron vessel.

 But below that, the team found the first layers that were used to construct the mound, with soil dating to around the 11th century. 
 
 By this period of history, the Vikings were no longer feared marauders sailing the seas and raiding Europe. Instead, the people who gathered at Dingwall were more likely subjects of Norse kings who ruled from the Orkney and Shetland Islands. 
 
 No one knows yet who built the site, though the sheer size of the mound suggests it was a fairly significant undertaking that required a lot of political power and resources. 
 
 No historical documents mention a Thing gathering site near the region, but Earl Thorfinn the Mighty came down from the Orkney Islands at the time and fought a battle in the general region. 
 
 ""He would certainly have had a political reason to make a statement,"" O'Grady said.

But finding a ""Thing"" site is no small task, in part because the gatherings usually occurred in open fields, and the temporary nature of them meant only modest traces of human life were left behind.

 Ryan Enos, a professor of government at Harvard, and a team of researchers that rated former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin a 95 out of 100 in “facial competence” in 2008, are back again, according to Washington Monthly magazine. This time, the researchers report that, objectively, the GOP nominee is even better looking than Palin: his grade was 99. 
 
 The researchers showed undergraduate students pictures of Romney, among others, for one second. The research was compiled in 2007 – when Romney was a relative unknown – a fact that researchers claim helps remove political opinions from the equation. 
 
 The relatively shocking news from the findings: running mate Paul Ryan scored a mere 67 in a pool of House candidates in 2004. The authors noted that abs were not taken into consideration in their findings. 
 
 The researchers found that only a handful of politicos topped Romney: former Democratic Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and current Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., were in that pool. ||||| Planting the Seeds of a New Heroin Epidemic Four out of five new users have previously abused painkillers. By Keith Humphreys

Biden trailed well behind, in the 62nd percentile. (Obama was considered too big a name in 2007, so he wasn't included.)

82,"It all seems rather mad, doesn't it? The decision to become involved militarily in the Libyan civil war couldn't take place within a less hospitable context. The U.S. is reeling from spending and deficits, we're already in two wars, our military has been stretched to the limit, we're restive at home, and no one, really, sees President Obama as the kind of leader you'd follow over the top. ""This way, men!"" ""No, I think I'll stay in my trench."" People didn't hire him to start battles but to end them. They didn't expect him to open new fronts. Did he not know this? 
 
 He has no happy experience as a rallier of public opinion and a leader of great endeavors; the central initiative of his presidency, the one that gave shape to his leadership, health care, is still unpopular and the cause of continued agitation. When he devoted his entire first year to it, he seemed off point and out of touch. 
 
 This was followed by the BP oil spill, which made him look snakebit. Now he seems incompetent and out of his depth in foreign and military affairs. He is more observed than followed, or perhaps I should say you follow him with your eyes and not your heart. So it's funny he'd feel free to launch and lead a war, which is what this confused and uncertain military action may become. 
 
 What was he thinking? What is he thinking? 
 
 Which gets me to Mr. Obama's speech, the one he hasn't given. I cannot for the life of me see how an American president can launch a serious military action without a full and formal national address in which he explains to the American people why he is doing what he is doing, why it is right, and why it is very much in the national interest. He referred to his aims in parts of speeches and appearances when he was in South America, but now he's home. More is needed, more is warranted, and more is deserved. He has to sit at that big desk and explain his thinking, put forward the facts as he sees them, and try to garner public support. He has to make a case for his own actions. It's what presidents do! And this is particularly important now, because there are reasons to fear the current involvement will either escalate and produce a lengthy conflict or collapse and produce humiliation. 
 
 Without a formal and extended statement, the air of weirdness, uncertainty and confusion that surrounds this endeavor will only deepen. 
 
 The questions that must be answered actually start with the essentials. What, exactly, are we doing? Why are we doing it? At what point, or after what arguments, did the president decide U.S. military involvement was warranted? Is our objective practical and doable? What is America's overriding strategic interest? In what way are the actions taken, and to be taken, seeing to those interests? 
 
 Matthew Kaminski of the editorial board explains America's role in the Libyan campaign. 
 
 From those questions flow many others. We know who we're against—Moammar Gadhafi, a bad man who's done very wicked things. But do we know who we're for? That is, what does the U.S. government know or think it knows about the composition and motives of the rebel forces we're attempting to assist? For 42 years, Gadhafi controlled his nation's tribes, sects and groups through brute force, bribes and blandishments. What will happen when they are no longer kept down? What will happen when they are no longer oppressed? What will they become, and what role will they play in the coming drama? Will their rebellion against Gadhafi degenerate into a dozen separate battles over oil, power and local dominance? 
 
 What happens if Gadhafi hangs on? The president has said he wants U.S. involvement to be brief. But what if Gadhafi is fighting on three months from now? 
 
 On the other hand, what happens if Gadhafi falls, if he's deposed in a palace coup or military coup, or is killed, or flees? What exactly do we imagine will take his place? 
 
 Supporters of U.S. intervention have argued that if we mean to protect Libya's civilians, as we have declared, then we must force regime change. But in order to remove Gadhafi, they add, we will need to do many other things. We will need to provide close-in air power. We will probably have to put in special forces teams to work with the rebels, who are largely untrained and ragtag. The Libyan army has tanks and brigades and heavy weapons. The U.S. and the allies will have to provide the rebels training and give them support. They will need antitank missiles and help in coordinating air strikes. 
 
 Once Gadhafi is gone, will there be a need for an international peacekeeping force to stabilize the country, to provide a peaceful transition, and to help the post-Gadhafi government restore its infrastructure? Will there be a partition? Will Libyan territory be altered? 
 
 None of this sounds like limited and discrete action. 
 
 In fact, this may turn out to be true: If Gadhafi survives, the crisis will go on and on. If Gadhafi falls, the crisis will go on and on. 
 
 Everyone who supports the Libyan endeavor says they don't want an occupation. One said the other day, ""We're not looking for a protracted occupation."" 
 
 Protracted? 
 
 Mr. Obama has apparently set great store in the fact that he was not acting alone, that Britain, France and Italy were eager to move. That's good—better to work with friends and act in concert. But it doesn't guarantee anything. A multilateral mistake is still a mistake. So far the allied effort has not been marked by good coordination and communication. If the conflict in Libya drags on, won't there tend to be more fissures, more tension, less commitment and more confusion as to objectives and command structures? Could the unanticipated results of the Libya action include new strains, even a new estrangement, among the allies? 
 
 How might Gadhafi hit out, in revenge, in his presumed last days, against America and the West? 
 
 And what, finally, about Congress? Putting aside the past half-century's argument about declarations of war, doesn't Congress, as representative of the people, have the obvious authority and responsibility to support the Libyan endeavor, or not, and to authorize funds, or not? 
 
 These are all big questions, and there are many other obvious ones. If the Libya endeavor is motivated solely by humanitarian concerns, then why haven't we acted on those concerns recently in other suffering nations? It's a rough old world out there, and there's a lot of suffering. What is our thinking going forward? What are the new rules of the road, if there are new rules? Were we, in Libya, making a preemptive strike against extraordinary suffering—suffering beyond what is inevitable in a civil war? 
 
 America has been through a difficult 10 years, and the burden of proof on the need for U.S. action would be with those who supported intervention. Chief among them, of course, is the president, who made the decision as commander in chief. He needs to sit down and tell the American people how this thing can possibly turn out well. He needs to tell them why it isn't mad. ||||| BENGHAZI, Libya -- France declared Libya's airspace ""under control"" on Friday, after NATO agreed to take command of the no-fly zone in a compromise that appeared to set up dual command centers and possibly new confusion. Coalition warplanes struck Moammar Gadhafi's forces outside the strategic eastern gateway city of Ajdabiya. 
 
 (SCROLL DOWN FOR UPDATES) 
 
 Representatives for the regime and the rebels were expected to meet formally for the first time Friday, in Ethiopia, in what the U.N. described as a part of an effort to reach a cease-fire and political solution.The overnight French and British strikes on an artillery battery and armored vehicles were intended to give a measure of relief to Ajdabiya, where residents have fled or cowered under more than a week of shelling and fighting between rebels and government troops. Explosions also could be heard in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, before daybreak Friday, apparently from airstrikes. 
 
 ""Libyan airspace is under control, and we proved it yesterday, because a Libyan plane in the hands of pro-Gadhafi forces, which had just taken off from Misrata in order to bomb Misrata, was destroyed by a French Rafale,"" Adm. Edouard Guillaud said on France-Info radio. 
 
 But the compromise that puts NATO in charge of clearing the skies still leaves the U.S. responsible for the more difficult task of planning attacks on Gadhafi's ground forces and other targets. 
 
 Ajdabiya has been under siege for more than a week, with the rebels holding the city center and scattered checkpoints but facing relentless shelling from government troops on the outskirts. Residents are without electicity or drinking water, and many have fled. 
 
 The U.S. military said coalition jets flew about 150 on Thursday, about 70 of them with American planes. 
 
 ""The operation is still focusing on tanks, combat vehicles, air defense targets – really whatever equipment and personnel are threatening the no-fly zone or civilians on the ground in such locations as Ajdabiya and along some other areas on the coast,"" Marine Corps Capt. Clint Gebke told reporters from aboard the USS Mount Whitney. 
 
 The U.S. has been trying to give up the lead role in the operation against Gadhafi's forces, and NATO agreed late Thursday to assume one element of it – control of the no-fly zone. 
 
 ""Nearly all, some 75 percent of the combat air patrol missions in support of the no-fly zone, are now being executed by our coalition partners,"" Navy Vice Adm. William Gortney, told reporters at the Pentagon. Other countries were handling less than 10 percent of such missions, he said. 
 
 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the United Arab Emirates would deploy 12 planes for the coalition effort. Clinton thanked the U.A.E. for becoming the second Arab country after Qatar to send planes. 
 
 Qatar and U.A.E. are expected to start flying air patrols over Libya by this weekend. 
 
 Libyan state television showed blackened and mangled bodies that it said were victims of airstrikes in Tripoli. Rebels have accused Gadhafi's forces of taking bodies from the morgue and pretending they were civilian casualties. 
 
 A U.S. intelligence report on Monday, the day after coalition missiles attacked Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital, said that a senior Gadhafi aide was told to take bodies from a morgue and place them at the scene of the bomb damage, to be displayed for visiting journalists. A senior U.S. defense official revealed the contents of the intelligence report on condition of anonymity because it was classified secret.

 Administration officials haven’t ruled out a big speech, but Obama is reluctant to make a major address on Libya until the United States hands over most command and combat duties to its allies.

 reset VIDEO: HRC update on Libya, NATO POLITICO 44 
 
 That’s not to say the president won’t talk about Libya over the next few days, aides say, but he’s not likely to succumb to pressure to deliver a long, explanatory address to outline his elusive endgame to the nation until the path ahead becomes clearer. 
 
 There were signs that might come sooner rather than later on Thursday. For the first time since combat operations began, the vast majority of flights over Libya on Thursday were conducted by U.S. allies, a sharp contrast to the previous 24 hours when American planes flew the majority of missions. 
 
 And NATO member nations on Thursday evening approved a plan under which the alliance will assume command of the no-fly zone over Libya. 
 
 “We are already seeing a significant reduction in the number of U.S. planes involved in the operation as the number of planes from other countries increase,” Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said after the decision by NATO. “Today we are taking the next step. All 28 allies have also now authorized military authorities to develop an operations plan for NATO to take on the broader civilian protections mission.” 
 
 Clinton’s reassuring assessment masked a ferocious round of last-minute negotiations, culminating in a four-way call between Clinton and the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Turkey on Thursday afternoon that sealed a preliminary deal. 
 
 “This was a hard diplomatic battle,” a senior administration official said. “Building consensus among 29 nations is never easy.” 
 
 Whatever happens, Obama is intent on putting the U.S. in the back seat. As part of an effort to downplay the scope of U.S. involvement, administration officials have flatly refused to call the enforcement of the Libyan no-fly, no-drive zone — which has included the launch of more than hundred cruise missiles and dozens of U.S. aircraft sorties — a “war.” 
 
 It is “a time-limited, scope-limited military action,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. 
 
 Still, the lack of a clearly articulated endgame — or even a rationale for quickly committing U.S. naval and air assets in a third Muslim nation — is making House and Senate members in both parties increasingly uneasy. 
 
 Their main concern: That Obama’s oft-stated goal of ousting Qadhafi isn’t backed up by the U.N. resolution, which calls only for the use of force in establishing a no-fly-zone and protecting civilians, putting U.S. forces in awkward suspension between humanitarian goals and regime change.","– Peggy Noonan is among those scratching their heads over the US decision to flex its muscle in Libya, and she'd like help figuring it out ... from President Obama himself. ""I cannot for the life of me see how an American president can launch a serious military action without a full and formal national address in which he explains to the American people why he is doing what he is doing, why it is right, and why it is very much in the national interest,"" she writes in the Wall Street Journal. Noonan spends most of the column raising question and after question about the intervention and sounds very skeptical about its chances of ending well. All the more reason for Obama to personally make his case. ""He has to sit at that big desk and explain his thinking, put forward the facts as he sees them, and try to garner public support,"" she writes. ""It's what presidents do!""

 THE identity of Jack The Ripper may have finally been confirmed, new evidence suggests. 
 
 Researchers now say that they have proven the authenticity of a much-disputed Victorian diary supposedly written by the notorious murderer. 
 
 Getty - Contributor James Maybrick, the cotton merchant suspected of being Jack The Ripper 
 
 Previously, doubt had been cast on the legitimacy of a diary published 25 years ago by a cotton merchant from Liverpool who was called James Maybrick. 
 
 Mike Barrett, who made the diary public, also died before he could properly explain the origin of the memoir – which led many to believe that the diary could be a forgery. 
 
 However, a team of experts, led by film maker Bruce Robinson, now say that they have evidence to suggest that the diary is genuine and does indeed describe the infamous murders. 
 
 According to a new book, the diary was discovered in Maybrick's former Liverpool home - putting him back in the frame as the Victorian serial killer. 
 
 James Maybrick died in 1889, a year after the Whitechapel murders and, in 1992, a team of electrical contractors renovated Maybrick's former property, known as Battlecrease House. 
 
 New evidence includes timesheets that prove workers were at the house on March 9 1992 – the same day that Mike Barrett told a London literary agent that he had Jack The Ripper's diary. 
 
 Rex Features The diary which experts now say they think proves Jack The Ripper's true identity 
 
 Robert Smith, who published the original diary in 1993, told the Telegraph that, because Barrett had boasted about being an author when workers found the diary, the workers thought that he could help them sell it on to a publisher. 
 
 Robert Smith added: ""The truth was that Barrett's only significant literary achievement was to write occasional puzzles for the weekly TV children's magazine, Look-In. 
 
 ""Barrett had a highly impetuous nature. Just seeing or being told about the signature at the end of the diary would have been enough for him to reach for the phone. 
 
 “He was not very literate and the idea that he would have been capable of producing such a sophisticated and credible forgery is not remotely plausible.”

 Three years later, Barrett said that he had made everything up - but he later retracted his confession. 
 
 The workers later denied any involvement in the discovery – but none of their stories matched. 
 
 Many critics resolved that the diary was a fabrication put together from news reports at the time, while others reckoned that only the real Jack The Ripper could have known the details the diary is said to reveal. 
 
 Hulton Archive - Getty New evidence seems to confirm that Liverpool cotton merchant, James Maybrick was indeed Jack the Ripper 
 
 Adamant that the diary is the real deal, Smith said: “The new and indisputable evidence, that on March 9 1992, the diary was removed from under the floorboards of the room that had been James Maybrick's bedroom in 1889, and offered later on the very same day to a London literary agent, overrides any other considerations regarding its authenticity. 
 
 ""It follows that James Maybrick is its most likely author. Was he Jack the Ripper? He now has to be a prime suspect, but the disputes over the Ripper's identity may well rage for another century at least"". 
 
 A limited edition of 25 Years of The Diary of Jack The Ripper: The True Facts by Robert Smith is available from www.mangobooks.co.uk from September 4. ||||| I spend probably 40 minutes a day crammed cheek to sweaty jowl with other London commuters—some of them drunks, farters, and shovers—in a swiftly moving cylinder hundreds of feet underground. It’s usually hot, and despite the fact that we are Tetrised in there, all of us are trying desperately to pretend that we are completely alone. Rarely do I give thanks for the experience, but this year marks the 155th anniversary of the London Underground, that efficient marvel of public transport. 
 
 On January 9, 1863, the world’s first-ever underground railway train, steam-operated, pulled out of Paddington Station, and rumbled 3.5 miles down the tubular tunnel to Farringdon Station. The line, which was financed by Metropolitan Railway, was an instant success: Approximately 40,000 people lined up for the novelty of riding a train underground. Within six months, 26,000 people were riding the train each day. 
 
 By 1884, there were more than 800 trains in operation in what was called the Inner Circle, a circular line that enclosed central London and that is now just the Circle Line. And now, with more than five times that number of trains operating and millions of people safely and swiftly reaching their destinations every day, the London Underground is truly a modern miracle of efficient transport. Here are 18 impressive facts and figures you might not have known about the London Tube. 
 
 1. THE MAJORITY OF THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS NOT UNDERGROUND. 
 
 
 
 iStock 
 
 The entire London Underground network is approximately 249 miles long, employing more than 4100 trains, and linking 270 stations. But only about 45 percent of those miles are underground. 
 
 2. EACH TRAIN TRAVELS ABOUT 114,500 MILES A YEAR. 
 
 Each Tube train travels an average of 114,500 miles a year, or 4.6 times around the world. The longest distance between adjacent stations is approximately 3.9 miles, between Chesham to Chalfont & Latimer. The shortest distance is about 984 feet, between Leicester Square and Covent Garden on the Picadilly Line (and since Covent Garden is usually mobbed, you’re better off getting off at Leicester Square and walking). 
 
 3. MORE THAN 1 BILLION JOURNEYS ARE MADE EACH YEAR. 
 
 Each year, about 1.3 billion journeys are made on the London Underground. The busiest station in the network is Waterloo, which sees about 100.3 million passengers per year; the least used is Roding Valley. 
 
 4. HALF A MILLION MICE CALL THE UNDERGROUND HOME. 
 
 An estimated 500,000 mice live in the tunnels, but they’re not the only pests—the mosquitoes that live in the Tube are of a different and somewhat more vicious species than their aboveground cousins. Called Culex pipiens molestus, they’re supposedly known for their voracious appetites. 
 
 5. THERE AE SOME GHOSTS REPORTEDLY LIVING DOWN THERE, TOO. 
 
 The London Underground is also supposedly home to a group of subterranean Londoners, who, just like the Mole People of New York’s Subway, took to the tunnels and mutated. The Tube is also reportedly home to a host of ghostly apparitions, including the Faceless Woman of Beacontree Station, the Toothy Man of Channelsea Depot, and the Screaming Spectre of Farringdon Station. 
 
 6. THE AVERAGE LONDONER SPENDS 11.5 DAYS OF EACH YEAR ON THE TUBE. 
 
 The average Londoner spends an average of about 11.5 days each year on the Underground—5.2 of those days in the Underground’s underground tunnels. (What’s unknown is how many hours of those days are spent stopped underground, waiting for a signal failure to be resolved, another train to move along, or for whatever bit of rubbish that has been thrown on the tracks at the station ahead of you to be cleared.) 
 
 7. THE FASTEST TRAINS TRAVEL AT SPEEDS OF OVER 60 MILES PER HOUR. 
 
 The fastest line is the Metropolitan, where trains can reach speeds of more than 60 miles per hour, but the average speed of a London Underground train is only around 20.5 miles per hour. 
 
 8. THE DEEPEST STATION IS NEARLY 200 FEET BELOW STREET LEVEL. 
 
 The deepest Underground station is Hampstead, on the Northern Line, which is located nearly 192 feet below street level. There’s an elevator, of course, but also an emergency spiral staircase featuring more than 320 steps, in case of emergency (or a fit of exercise mania). 
 
 9. IN 1969, QUEEN ELIZABETH TOOK CONTROL OF THE VICTORIA LINE. 
 
 In 1969, Queen Elizabeth II commemorated the opening of the Victoria Line by driving one of the new trains from Green Park to Oxford Circus. It was her second ride ever on a London Underground train, the first being when she was 13 and accompanied by her sister and governess. Presumably her stint as Tube driver was without incident as eight years later, the Queen was again allowed in the cab of a Picadilly Line train when she presided over the opening of the line’s extension. 
 
 10. THE FIRST ESCALATOR WAS A MISERABLE FAILURE. 
 
 The Underground’s first real escalator was built in 1911 at Earl’s Court, but four years before that, a spiral escalator was installed at Holloway Road Station. It didn’t last very long—in fact, it only lasted a day of testing and never actually saw public use. Its remains are held at the London Transport Museum’s Depot, which is only open to the public a few times per year. 
 
 11. THE LONGEST ESCALATOR IS NEARLY 200 FEET LONG. 
 
 The longest escalator at any Underground station is the 197-foot-long moving stair at Angel, in Islington, on the Northern line. 
 
 12. PEOPLE HAVE LEFT A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS ON THE TRAINS. 
 
 Among the strangest things left on the Underground and collected by the Lost Property Office: A jar of bull semen; outboard motor; three dead bats in a container; a vasectomy kit; a harpoon gun, which may have gone with the 14-foot long boat; a stuffed eagle; breast implants; false teeth and a surprising number of prosthetic limbs; a four-foot tall Mickey Mouse; six full-sized mannequins; and an urn containing a dead man’s ashes, which was reunited with his brother five years after it was lost. 
 
 13. JERRY SPRINGER WAS BORN AT HIGHGATE STATION. 
 
 Politician-turned-trash talk show host Jerry Springer was born at Highgate Station on the Northern Line on February 13, 1944, when his mother sought shelter during a Luftwaffe raid during World War II. 
 
 14. MANY PEOPLE USED TUBE STATIONS ARE AIR RAID SHELTERS DURING WORLD WAR II, EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT BANNED THE PRACTICE. 
 
 Speaking of air raids: At the start of the London Blitz, Germany’s nightly bombing raids on the British capital in September 1939, the government banned people from using the Tube stations as air raid shelters, claiming that the stations should be reserved only for transport. People got around the ban by simply buying a ticket and refusing to the leave the platform. A month later, the government realized that the ban was unenforceable at best and cruel at worst, and gave the go-ahead for stations to be used as shelters. 
 
 By the end of the war, sheltering in the Underground had became so regular that a ticketing scheme was introduced to keep people from panicking at the queues, and more than 22,000 bunk beds were installed in stations across the system to provide places for them to sleep.

 The London Underground’s iconic map, which bears no relationship to actual topographical or geographical features, was designed in 1933 by Harry Beck. Beck, an engineering draftsman who worked in the London Underground’s signals office, was supposedly inspired by electronic circuit boards, and saw ways of tidying up the lines. But the department rejected the initial proposal, claiming it was too radical, and Beck was paid a paltry less than $15 for his work. Two years and some modifications later, however, the Underground adopted the map and has used it ever since.","– In 1992, a 9,000-word diary was found in the floorboards of a home in England containing a detailed confession to murders tied to Jack the Ripper, the serial killer who terrorized London for 10 weeks in 1888. It ended thusly: ""I give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours Truly, Jack The Ripper."" It appears to belong to wealthy Liverpool cotton Merchant James Maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the Telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director Bruce Robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on Maybrick's home, Battlecrease House, on March 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer Mike Barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But Barrett was a colorful character who frequented the Saddle Inn public house in Anfield, where one of the electricians working on Battlecrease House was also a regular. Because Barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto Barrett, who then famously contacted a London literary agent that very day in March claiming he had Jack the Ripper's diary, adds the Sun.

 Researchers at Arizona State University estimate that in a city of one million people, $13 million dollars worth of metals could be accumulating annually in sludge, the byproduct of treated sewage. 
 
 The study, which analyzed sludge from treatment centers in Arizona and samples from across the country stored at the U.S. National Biosolids Repository, focused on 13 minerals with the highest value, including gold, silver, copper, and platinum. If every bit of the metals is retrieved, researchers reported there could be $280 per ton of sludge. 
 
 “While we expected that the metals were present at low concentration, the fact that the small amounts represent such a significant economic value was definitely surprising,” says Pierre Herckes, associate professor at ASU and co-author of the study. Of the $13 million, $2.6 million alone comes from gold and silver. 
 
 
 
 It’s possible that the metals found in sewage — which is basically anything that is flushed down a drain or toilet — is a result of discharge from jewelry and electronics manufacturing plants, mining, electroplating, and similar industries. After sewage is treated, 60% of the remaining sludge is spread across fields, yards, and forests throughout the country as fertilizer, with the rest sent to landfills or incinerated. 
 
 The concentration of metals in sludge, however, could pose environmental risks, so finding a way to extract them would help mitigate the effects of the gold flush — err, rush. 
 
 In 2009, a waste treatment facility in central Japan managed to extract nearly 2 kilograms of gold from the ash of incinerated sludge, which was more than the amount pulled from Japan’s Hishikari Mine, one of the world’s top gold mines. 
 
 However, no U.S. plants have started sifting through the goo just yet. 
 
 “Technically, it is possible to extract these metals, although it is very challenging,” says Herckes. Currently, there is no technology we are aware of that can do it on a large scale without the use of enormous amounts of energy and harsh chemicals, he adds. 
 
 So don’t go digging out your old prospecting pan from the garage just yet. You’d have better luck scouring the streets of Manhattan’s Diamond District, where one urban prospector pulled in almost $1,000 in a week by collecting bits of gold and jewels off the ground. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| If the holy grail of medieval alchemists was turning lead into gold, how much more magical would it be to draw gold from, well, poop? It turns out that a ton of sludge, the goo left behind when treating sewage, could contain several hundred dollars’ worth of metals—potentially enough to generate millions of dollars worth of gold, silver, and other minerals each year for a city of a million people. 
 
 Metals have long been known to concentrate in sewage, which mixes toilet water with effluent from industrial manufacturing, storm runoff, and anything else flushed down the drain. It’s a headache for sewage utilities that must cope with toxic metals lacing wastewater headed for streams or sludge that might otherwise be spread on farm fields. 
 
 But what if those metals had value? In a new study, scientists at Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, quantified the different metals in sewage sludge and estimated what it all might be worth. They took sludge samples gathered from around the country and measured the metal content using a mass spectrometer that can discern different elements as they are ionized in a superhot plasma. The upshot: There's as much as $13 million worth of metals in the sludge produced every year by a million-person city, including $2.6 million in gold and silver, they report online this week in Environmental Science & Technology. 
 
 That amount won't be rattling the world gold market, nor would it be feasible to extract every last bit. But the study’s lead author, environmental engineer Paul Westerhoff, says it could prove worthwhile for cities looking for ways to gain value from something that can be a costly disposal problem. One city in Japan has already tried extracting gold from its sludge. In Suwa in Nagano Prefecture, a treatment plant near a large number of precision equipment manufacturers reportedly collected nearly 2 kilograms of gold in every metric ton of ash left from burning sludge, making it more gold-rich than the ore in many mines. 
 
 Although no U.S. sewage plants have followed suit, the new study adds to a growing push to rethink sewage as a valuable commodity, says Jordan Peccia, a Yale University engineer who was not involved in the work. Approximately 8 million tons of biosolids—a dried derivative of sludge—are generated every year in the United States. 
 
 Today, about 60% of the sewage sludge in the United States is already spread on fields and forests as fertilizer. But there are concerns it poses contamination risks from toxic chemicals and pathogens, a subject Peccia’s lab studies. The remaining sludge is burned in incinerators or dumped in landfills. 
 
 “We’re not going to get rid of this sewage sludge,” Peccia says. “We need to make this push where we stop thinking about it as a liability and instead we think about it as a resource. And anything we can find in sewage sludge that’s valuable, it’s good.” 
 
 Metals aren’t the only things with potential value. A small number of sewage plants are removing phosphorous and nitrogen, which can be sold as fertilizer. A Swedish treatment plant is testing the feasibility of making bioplastics from wastewater. A model sewage incinerator that generates electricity and drinking water was just promoted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which helped fund its construction. 
 
 But it could be a while before wastewater operators start prospecting for precious metals in more than an isolated case. The minerals found in the sludge were frequently dissolved or in microscopic particles. Rare earth elements were so dilute that they were present in levels similar to those in plain dirt. 
 
 Precious metals such as gold could find their way into the sewers courtesy of mining, electroplating, electronics and jewelry manufacturing, or industrial and automotive catalysts. The sludge in the study came from two Arizona treatment plants and from a mixture of samples from around the country stored at ASU’s U.S. National Biosolids Repository. 
 
 Focusing on 13 of the most concentrated minerals with the highest value, the scientists put the haul at $280 per ton, or $8 million for that hypothetical million-person city. That included such precious metals as platinum, gold, and silver, as well as more common copper, iron, and zinc. A metric ton of sludge contained 16.7 grams of silver and about a third of a gram of gold. Even then, the practical value could be less, as the estimate was based on extracting every bit of the metals. 
 
 The study doesn’t spell out the potential cost of getting at these metals or the price society pays for leaving them in the sludge, such as added pollution. ""The next thing is to look at whether it’s economically or technically viable,” Westerhoff says. “We think it is.” 
 
 Cost is one of the chief barriers keeping sewage treatment plants from going for the gold, says Charles Bott, chief of research and development at the Hampton Roads Sanitation District in Virginia Beach, which serves 1.7 million people in southeastern Virginia. The district started extracting phosphorous and nitrogen from sludge at one of its plants in 2010 to comply with stricter protections for Chesapeake Bay. Mining sludge is “a hot topic of conversation,” Bott says. “It’s just a question of getting to the point where the technology is available that makes the finances work out.”","– The sewage being treated by your city could be a veritable gold mine. That's because all kinds of metals end up in sewage sludge, which is the leftovers from treated sewage, Science reports. Researchers in Arizona recently found that a city of a million people could generate up to $13 million a year in such metals, with $2.6 million of that coming in the form of gold and silver. They studied the samples, which came from 32 states, with a mass spectrometer, Discover reports; the tool uses extreme heat to reveal elements. On a global scale, they found, sludge probably contains about 360 tons of gold each year. ""While we expected that the metals were present at low concentration, the fact that the small amounts represent such a significant economic value was definitely surprising,"" a study co-author tells Time. Getting at those metals might sound like a pipe dream, quite literally, but a city in Japan was able to get about four pounds of gold from every metric ton of ash from burned sludge. That's better than what some mines can offer, Science notes. ""We need to make this push where we stop thinking about (sewage sludge) as a liability and instead we think about it as a resource,"" says an outside researcher. Unfortunately, there's not currently any technology to extract metals from sludge on a large scale, but if we could someday find a way to do so, there could be environmental benefits, too: The metals in sludge, which is often used as fertilizer, may not be great for the environment, so removing them could be a good thing. As for how metals get into wastewater? Industries like electronics, jewelry manufacturing, mining, and the like.

87,"One of the survivors of the disastrous Fyre Festival in the Bahamas has filed a $100 million class action lawsuit against co-founders Billy McFarland and Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins), accusing the duo of subjecting festivalgoers to ""dangerous conditions"" at a luxury festival that organizers allegedly knew was doomed. 
 
 Related Fyre Festival Head Billy McFarland: 'We Were a Little Naive' ""We were overwhelmed and just didn't have the foresight to solve all these problems,"" organizer says. ""Next year, we will definitely start earlier"" 
 
 In a legal complaint obtained by Rolling Stone, the suit claims that ""this outrageous failure to prepare, coupled with Defendants' deliberate falsehoods in promoting the island 'experience,' demonstrates that the Fyre Festival was nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam from the very beginning."" 
 
 ""Defendants intended to fleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water — and without regard to what might happen to them after that,"" the suit adds. 
 
 In the lawsuit, filed by lawyer Mark Geragos on behalf of attendee Daniel Jung, the many shortcomings of the festival are mapped out via eyewitness reports and social media postings, providing a tableaux of just how poorly conceived and planned the festival was. 
 
 ""The festival's lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees — suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions — that was closer to The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,"" the lawsuit states. 
 
 ""Festival-goers survived on bare rations, little more than bread and a slice of cheese, and tried to escape the elements in the only shelter provided by Defendants: small clusters of 'FEMA tents,' exposed on a sand bar, that were soaked and battered by wind and rain."" 
 
 
 
 The dinner that @fyrefestival promised us was catered by Steven Starr is literally bread, cheese, and salad with dressing. #fyrefestival pic.twitter.com/I8d0UlSNbd — Tr3vor (@trev4president) April 28, 2017 
 
 ""We have been deluged with calls from people with horror stories,"" Geragos tells Rolling Stone. ""We will be expanding the scope of our case dramatically and we are pursuing other remedies as well."" 
 
 
 
 The lawsuit alleges fraud and breach of contract against the organizers, levying claims that McFarland and Atkins knowingly lied about the festival's promised location – it was not an island privately owned by Pablo Escobar as promised, but rather a gravelly site near a Sandals in the Bahamas strewn with garbage. 
 
 Because the festival was ""cashless"" – organizers recommended attendees deposit funds into the Fyre wristband – many attendees did not have the necessary money to ensure transportation back to the Bahamas airport as the festival collapsed Friday. 
 
 The lawsuit also alleges that McFarland and Ja Rule knew that the festival was troubled but proceeded anyway, putting festivalgoers in danger. 
 
 ""Shockingly, Defendants had been aware for months that their festival was dangerously under-equipped and posed a serious danger to anyone in attendance,"" the lawsuit added. 
 
 ""More troublingly, Mr. McFarland and Mr. Atkins began personally reaching out to performers and celebrities in advance of the festival and warned them not to attend — acknowledging the fact that the festival was outrageously underequipped and potentially dangerous for anyone in attendance."" 
 
 ""We are in the process of helping all Fyre Festival guests apply for refunds,"" a member of the festival's management team tells Rolling Stone. ""All guests who purchased tickets have been sent the appropriate form to start the refund procedure. The Fyre Festival is a dream and vision that we regrettably did not see come to life how we’d imagined in 2017, but our main priority now is rectifying the situation and helping all affected guests. 
 
 ""Once the refund application process is complete, we will start sharing news on plans for Fyre Festival 2018,"" he adds. ""Currently 81% of guests who have filled out the refund application have said they would like to attend Fyre Festival 2018. We are so thankful for their support and excitement as we strive to make this right."" 
 
 Speaking to Rolling Stone, McFarland acknowledged that the first-time festival organizers were ""a little naive"" and quickly became overwhelmed under the circumstances, but added that the Fyre Festival would return in 2018 at a stateside venue. 
 
 
 
 ""We were overwhelmed and just didn't have the foresight to solve all these problems,"" McFarland said. ""We thought we were making timeframes that were correct. We were a little naïve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves. Next year, we will definitely start earlier. The reality is, we weren't experienced enough to keep up."" 
 
 
 
 ""I'm heartbroken at this moment,"" Ja Rule told Rolling Stone last week. ""My partners and I wanted this to be an amazing event, it was NOT A SCAM as everyone is reporting. I don't know how everything went so left but I'm working to make it right by making sure everyone is refunded ... I truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT ... but I'm taking responsibility. I'm deeply sorry to everyone who was inconvenienced by this."" 
 
 
 
 Fyre Festival Lawsuit by mendle44 on Scribd ||||| A major lawsuit has been filed in California against Ja Rule and Billy McFarland, organizers of the Fyre Festival, the two-weekend concert in the Bahamas that was scheduled for last weekend but collapsed in disorganization before it started. The suit was filed on Sunday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by celebrity trial lawyer Mark Geragos, who is seeking class action status. Geragos filed suit electronically on Sunday on behalf of plaintiff Daniel Jung, who is seeking $5 million in damages for alleged fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation. 
 
 The suit anticipates a class of “more than 150 “plaintiffs for whom it seeks a minimum of $100 million. Geragos will be busy over the upcoming week seeking out other litigants to join the suit, which alleges that the “festival’s lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees — suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions — that was closer to ‘The Hunger Games’ or ‘Lord of the Flies’ than Coachella.” 
 
 The suit claims as its causes of action: fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation and seeks a minimum of $100 million in damages. It is believed a crowd of approximately 6,000 attendees was expected to attend the festival, though it is unclear how many tickets were actually sold. 
 
 Tickets to Fyre Fest cost anywhere from $1,000 to $125,000 for luxury group packages to the event, which was to have run in two parts: April 28-30 and May 5-7 on the private Fyre Cay in the Grand Bahamas Exuma Island chain. Performers were to include Blink-182, Migos, Major Lazer and Disclosure. By April 27 social media began lighting up with reports of distressed guests, arriving to find not the luxury accommodations they’d signed up for, but a dirt field with flimsy tents. 
 
 In the past, Geragos has represented Michael Jackson, Winona Ryder, singer Kesha and politician Gary Condit in high-profile cases. 
 
 Jung claims to have spent $2,000 on his Fyre Festival ticket and airfare. For that, he and fellow “festival-goers survived on bare rations, little more than bread and a slice of cheese, and tried to escape the elements in the only shelter provided by Defendants: small clusters of ‘FEMA tents,’ exposed on a sand bar, that were soaked and battered by wind and rain.” 
 
 The commonwealth of Bahamas may well file a suit of its own. TMZ reported the Bahamas “stands to lose out on millions with the festival being called off … and tourism officials are devastated.” The Ministry of Tourism released a statement saying it is “extremely disappointed.” 
 
 ABC News reports that the festival site is now in “lockdown” by the island’s government. “Private security guards were seen Saturday protecting the main site where people had been slated to sleep in luxury tents,” ABC reported, alleging McFarland failed to pay customs duty taxes “on items that he imported for the event,” and that “he and his staff have left the items with a security company guarding it.” 
 
 Having removed promotional materials for the festival, the Fyre Fest official website now offers its explanation for the disastrous turn of events, claiming the organizers were overwhelmed by the response after news of the fest went viral. Finding the island couldn’t support the swelling crowd, it was decided “infrastructure for a festival of this magnitude needed to be built from the ground up. So, we decided to literally attempt to build a city. We set up water and waste management, brought an ambulance from New York, and chartered 737 planes to shuttle our guests via 12 flights a day from Miami.” McFarland made similar comments to Rolling Stone and in a video posted on TMZ. 
 
 To say the efforts fell short is an understatement. The suit alleges that festival attendees became virtual prisoners: “Faced with the complete lack of even the most basic amenities, as well as no assistance from Defendants, festival attendees began to panic. Predictably, Attendees began attempting to leave the island en masse, but found themselves trapped—even locked inside an airport awaiting delayed flights.” 
 
 Efforts to “escape,” the suit claims, “were hamstrung by their reliance upon Defendants for transportation, as well as by the fact that Defendants promoted the festival as a ‘cashless’ event—Defendants instructed attendees to upload funds to a wristband for use at the festival rather than bringing any cash. As such, Attendees were unable to purchase basic transportation on local taxis or busses, which accept only cash. As a result … at least one attendee suffered a medical emergency and lost consciousness after being locked inside a nearby building with other concert-goers waiting to be airlifted from the island.” 
 
 Given that the festivals organizers did not have the funds to compensate the entertainers booked to perform — and it is unclear as to whether they had insurance — speculation has begun that Geragos may go after some of the bigger name models who took part in promoting the ill-fated event. Celebrities “including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski” were cited by name in the complaint, which says they used their social media accounts “to generate ticket sales.” The website FashionLaw.com speculates the models’ participation in promoting the site may trigger a Federal Trade Commission proceeding for false advertising. 
 
 Although the Fyre Fest organizers have offered to give all disappointed 2017 festival-goers free tickets to the 2018 iteration, which they said they intend to hold in the United States, it’s clear that this isn’t going to make the problem go away and that all involved have a long legal slog ahead. 
 
 Neither Geragos, McFarland nor a representative for Ja Rule replied for requests for comment at the time this report was filed.","– If organizers of the music-festival-turned-disaster known as the Fyre Festival had hoped to make a quick buck, their strategy may be backfiring in a big way. Rolling Stone reports that an attendee/survivor has filed a $100 million class-action lawsuit against festival creators Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule, aka Jeffrey Atkins. The complaint ticks off a by-now familiar litany of complaints about the supposedly luxurious getaway in the Bahamas that saw everything that could go wrong do so in spectacular fashion. And one big problem for McFarland and Ja Rule is that their well-heeled clientele can afford big-name lawyers.

88,"A 50-year-old Tennessee man, who authorities said kidnapped a 15-year-old girl this month, was spotted shopping at an Oklahoma City Wal-Mart on March 15. 
 
 The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation confirmed on Friday the sighting of Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas. The bureau said it obtained surveillance video from the Wal-Mart at 100 E Interstate 240 Service Road after receiving a tip. 
 
 Investigators said the video shows Cummins and Thomas shopping in the store on March 15. Cummins used cash to buy food, and he had altered his appearance by darkening his hair, according to a news release. 
 
 Investigators said they were working to determine the vehicle the man and teen were traveling in. 
 
 Officer Travis Vernier said the TBI has not asked for Oklahoma City police assistance. 
 
 “They're really conducting the investigation,” Vernier said, adding authorities don't know if Cummins and Thomas were just passing through Oklahoma City. 
 
 Thomas was last seen on March 13, the day authorities said Cummins kidnapped her. Cummins is a former teacher at the school she attended in Culleoka, Tenn., which is about 60 miles south of Nashville 
 
 He was suspended from the school after an investigation was launched into allegations he had inappropriate contact with Thomas. A Feb. 8 memo from Maury County Public Schools states that a student at the Culleoka Unit School reported seeing Cummins and Thomas kiss on Jan. 23. 
 
 “Neither Mr. Cummins nor Beth Thomas confessed to the incident. Neither party admitted to behaving inappropriately towards the other. The allegation of teacher Tad Cummins kissing student Beth Thomas could not be confirmed from the evidence presented,” school district officials reported in the memo. 
 
 Thomas had been a student in Cummins' forensics class, officials said. The teacher was suspended without pay from the school district on Feb. 6 and fired the day after Thomas went missing. 
 
 Cummins is described as about 6 feet tall, weighing about 200 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. He is thought to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license plate 976-ZPT. 
 
 Thomas is described as about 5 feet tall, weighing about 120 pounds, and was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. 
 
 A warrant has been issued for Cummins on complaints of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. He was added to the TBI's most wanted list on Friday and a $1,000 reward for information leading to his arrest is offered. 
 
 Also on Friday, the teacher's wife of 31 years filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple have two children together. 
 
 Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself in and bring the girl home safely. 
 
 Anyone with information should call 911 or the TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND.

 (WIAT) -- The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation says they have confirmed a sighting of 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas and her alleged kidnapper Tad Cummins. 
 
 The TBI posted the following on their website Friday morning: 
 
 ""Late Thursday, after receiving information from a tip, investigators obtained surveillance images from a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from the afternoon of March 15th, showing Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas shopping at the store. Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but did not purchase anything else of significance. The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing. 
 
 Thomas, 15, disappeared on Monday, March 13th and is believed to have been kidnapped by 50-year-old Tad Cummins, a former teacher at her school in Maury County, Tennessee. The school district in Maury County terminated Cummins in the wake of an ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with Thomas at the school earlier this year. 
 
 Thomas is a 15-year-old white female, with hazel eyes, stands 5'0"" and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male, who stands 6'0"", weighs approximately 200 pounds, and has brown hair and eyes. He is believe to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. A warrant has been issued for Cummins for Sexual Contact with a Minor and Aggravated Kidnapping. On Friday, the TBI added him to the state's ‘Top 10 Most Wanted' list. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his capture. 
 
 As of this morning, the TBI received more than 1,200 tips from across the country. The TBI would urge the public to remain vigilant and report any information that may prove beneficial in the ongoing search to 1-800-TBI-FIND. If you spot the vehicle and can verify the license plate to be TN 976-ZPT, call 911 immediately."" ||||| Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas were spotted March 15th in Oklahoma City. (Photo: TBI)

Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas are seen in the video—taken March 15 but not confirmed or released until Friday—using cash to buy food at the Walmart. According to the Tennessean, the video represents the first images of Cummins and Thomas since the alleged kidnapping on March 13. Cummins appears to have darkened his hair, and Thomas now appears to have red hair, WIAT reports. The video was made public after the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation received a tip Thursday. Cummins was fired from his teaching job following alleged inappropriate contact with Thomas, a student at his school, earlier this year. The two reportedly exchanged potentially romantic emails, though Thomas' family says she once hid from Cummins. There was a possible sighting of Cummins' car in Texas, and there have also been reports Cummins and Thomas are now in Mexico. Investigators have received more than 1,200 tips regarding Cummins and Thomas so far.","<pad> Tad Cummins, who authorities said kidnapped a 15-year-old girl this month, was spotted shopping at an Oklahoma City Wal-Mart on March 15.</s>",0.16783216503887724,0.05181346940320554,0.1258741230808353
89,"The Gaia mission, scheduled to launch Thursday morning (Dec. 19), could be a bonanza for discovering exoplanets, perhaps finding more than 2,500 new alien worlds, scientists suggest. 
 
 Gaia, a $1 billion (740 million euros) mission from the European Space Agency (ESA), aims to chart a 3D map of the Milky Way by surveying more than 1 billion stars, amounting to about 1 percent of the stars in the galaxy, using its billion-pixel camera. Its goal is to make the largest, most precise map of where Earth dwells by observing the position of each of these stars 70 times over five years. 
 
 ESA will broadcast a live webcast of Gaia's launch atop a Russian Soyuz rocket from the Guiana Space Center in South America beginning at 3:30 a.m. EST (0830 GMT) on Thursday. Gaia is scheduled to launch at 4:12 a.m. EST (0912 GMT), and you can watch the Gaia webcast live on SPACE.com, courtesy of ESA. [See photos of the Gaia spacecraft] 
 
 To pinpoint the position of a star in 3D — a field known as astrometry — Gaia will measure the distance of the star from the sun. The satellite will do so by watching how its position shifts over time. As the Earth orbits the sun, the apparent positions of stars change with regard to each other due to how our viewpoint has moved, a phenomenon known as parallax. 
 
 Discovering a star's distance can narrow down many of its other details. For instance, the actual brightness of a star can only be determined by not only measuring how bright it appears but also how far away it lies and thus how distance might have dimmed its light. Once researchers know how bright a star actually is, they can determine how much fuel it must burn — that is, the star's mass. A star's brightness is also related to its width, and so discovering its brightness can help deduce its size. Knowing a star's mass and size then helps determine the strength of gravity on its surface. 
 
 Gaia will also scan the color of stars. This can help reveal details of their chemical makeup as well as its temperature, as the color of a star depends on its surface temperature. Knowing the brightness and color of a star can also help figure out its age and thus stage in its evolution. All in all, Gaia will help shed light on the composition, formation and evolution of the stars that make up the galaxy, researchers say.

 Charting the stars and planets 
 
 Gaia is not the first space mission to chart the stars. In 1989, ESA launched the Hipparcos satellite, which charted the positions of more than 100,000 stars with high precision and more than 2 million stars with slightly less precision. In the end, Hipparcos measured the distances of all stars within 325 light-years and bright stars within 3,250 light-years (to within 10 percent). 
 
 In comparison, Gaia will collect more than 30 times more light than Hipparcos. This will help measure a star's position 200 times more accurately. All in all, Gaia can measure the distances of stars as far away as the galactic center — roughly 32,500 light-years away — with an accuracy within 10 percent. 
 
 On top of what light Gaia might shed on the stars in the Milky Way, it may also reveal exoplanets orbiting them, said astronomer Alessandro Sozzetti at the Astrophysical Observatory of Turin in Italy. This could be the first time exoplanets are detected using astrometry. [Video: Galaxy's Most Precise 3D Map: Gaia Probe Will Make It] 
 
 NASA's exoplanet-hunting Kepler spacecraft discovered planets through photometry — that is, by measuring light. It looked at regular dips in starlight caused by planets crossing between stars and Earth. 
 
 Gaia can hunt worlds a different way. The gravitational pull of a planet can introduce a regular wobble in its host star's position as they orbit each other that Gaia can detect over time. 
 
 Gaia will be most effective at detecting giant planets orbiting small stars. These planetary systems are prone to generating significant, noticeable wobbles in a star's position. 
 
 Sozzetti and his colleagues focused on red dwarfs, also known as M dwarf stars, which are relatively small, less than 60 percent the mass of the sun. These stars make up roughly three-quarters of the stars in the galaxy, and scientists recently found red dwarfs are far more common than before thought, making up at least 80 percent of the total number of stars. Moreover, past research suggests about 6.5 percent of red dwarfs host giant Jupiter-mass planets. 
 
 The researchers devised computer models simulating Jupiter-mass planets around the 3,150 red dwarfs known to exist within about 110 light-years of Earth. They estimated Gaia could detect about 100 new giant planets from this sample if such worlds exist about 0.5 to 3 astronomical units around those stars. (An astronomical unit is equal to Earth's distance from the sun — about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers.) 
 
 In addition, unlike Kepler, Gaia should be able to deduce the full orbits and masses of these giant worlds. For more than 80 percent of stars detected by Gaia around M dwarf stars within about 110 light-years of Earth, their masses could be measured to within 10 percent. 
 
 Extrapolating from these findings, the researchers suggest Gaia could find about 2,600 giant planets orbiting the roughly 415,000 red dwarfs within about 325 light-years from Earth. [The Strangest Alien Planets (Photos)] 
 
 Sozzetti and his colleagues detailed their findings online Nov. 11 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 
 
 ""Gaia should be able to detect orbital motion for giant planets orbiting hundreds of M dwarfs,"" said astronomer David Latham at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who did not take part in this study. 
 
 The researchers also calculated they could accurately derive the masses and orbits of as many as 500 of these 2,600 planets. In addition, within this group of stars, Gaia might identify hints of 10 systems with planets that might possibly noticeably cross in front of their host stars. 
 
 Exoplanet astrometry 
 
 Astronomers have tried detecting exoplanets using astrometry before. Until now, astrometry has only helped confirm the existence of exoplanets detected through other methods, not ones astrometry spotted directly. So far astrometry has suffered about 70 years of blunders in the field of exoplanet detection, ""with many a discovery announcement biting the dust,"" Sozzetti said. ""We're finally on the verge of seeing astrometry coming of age and providing substantial contributions to this field."" 
 
 Sozzetti cautioned that Gaia is not sensitive enough to detect planets of about Earth's mass, as Kepler is. ""Its astrometric accuracy is not sufficient, not even for the nearest stars,"" he said. 
 
 Gaia should also not be able to detect planets within the habitable zones of red dwarfs — that is, the areas around stars where it is warm enough on a planet's surface for water to stay liquid. Since red dwarfs are very dim, their habitable zones are typically very close to them, about 3 percent to 30 percent of an astronomical unit. The astrometric signals caused by planets get increasingly smaller the closer they are to their stars, meaning that worlds in a red dwarf's habitable zone would probably be too difficult to detect. 
 
 However, Sozzetti said Gaia could provide unique insights ""on the existence of systems in which the likelihood of a potentially habitable terrestrial planet may have formed is high."" By seeing where a giant planet is orbiting a star, Gaia can help rule out any systems where giant planets may have interfered with the formation of rocky planets within those stars' habitable zones. 
 
 Sozzetti noted that Gaia and Kepler ought to be highly complementary in several ways. While Kepler can discover many small worlds, Gaia can find thousands of giant planets. 
 
 ""The combination of Gaia and Kepler data will allow for a much improved understanding of planetary systems' properties and frequencies as a function of the host stars' characteristics,"" Sozzetti said.

 Europe has launched the Gaia satellite - one of the most ambitious space missions in history. 
 
 The 740m-euro (£620m) observatory lifted off from the Sinnamary complex in French Guiana at 06:12 local time (09:12 GMT). 
 
 Gaia is going to map the precise positions and distances to more than a billion stars. 
 
 This should give us the first realistic picture of how our Milky Way galaxy is constructed. 
 
 Gaia's remarkable sensitivity will lead also to the detection of many thousands of previously unseen objects, including new planets and asteroids. 
 
 It will allow us, for the first time ever, to walk through the Milky Way - to say where everything is, to say what everything is Prof Gerry Gilmore, Cambridge University 
 
 Separation from the Soyuz upper-stage was confirmed just before 10:00 GMT. 
 
 The satellite is now travelling out to an observing station some 1.5 million km from the Earth on its nightside - a journey that will take about a month to complete. 
 
 Gaia has been in development for more than 20 years. 
 
 It will be engaged in what is termed astrometry - the science of mapping the locations and movements of celestial objects. 
 
 To do this, it carries two telescopes that throw light on to a huge, one-billion-pixel camera detector connected to a trio of instruments. 
 
 Gaia will use this ultra-stable and supersensitive optical equipment to pinpoint its sample of stars with extraordinary confidence. 
 
 Gaia - The discovery machine 
 
 Gaia will make a very precise 3D map of our Milky Way Galaxy 
 
 It is the successor to the Hipparcos satellite which mapped some 100,000 stars 
 
 The one billion to be catalogued by Gaia is still only 1% of the Milky Way's total 
 
 But the survey's quality promises a raft of discoveries beyond just the star map 
 
 It will find new asteroids and planets; It will test physical constants and theories 
 
 Gaia's sky map will be the reference to guide future telescopes' observations 
 
 By repeatedly viewing its targets over five years, it should get to know the brightest stars' coordinates down to an error of just seven micro-arcseconds. 
 
 ""This angle is equivalent to the size of a euro coin on the Moon as seen from Earth,"" explained Prof Alvaro Gimenez, Esa's director of science. 
 
 Gaia will compile profiles on the stars it sees. 
 
 As well as working out how far away they are, the satellite will study their motion across the sky. 
 
 Their physical properties will also be catalogued - details such as brightness, temperature, and composition. It should even be possible then to determine their ages. 
 
 And for about 150 million of these stars, Gaia will measure their velocity either towards or away from us. 
 
 This will enable scientists to use them as three-dimensional markers to trace the evolution of the Milky Way, to in essence make a time-lapse movie that can be run forwards to see what happens in the future, or run backwards to reveal how the galaxy was assembled in the past. 
 
 And because Gaia will track anything that passes across its camera detector, it is likely also to see a colossal number of objects that have hitherto gone unrecorded - such as comets, asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, cold dead stars, and even tepid stars that never quite fired into life. 
 
 ""It will allow us, for the first time ever, to walk through the Milky Way - to say where everything is, to say what everything is. It is truly a transformative mission,"" said Prof Gerry Gilmore from Cambridge University, UK. 
 
 By the end of the decade, the Gaia archive of processed data is expected to exceed 1 Petabyte (1 million Gigabytes), equivalent to about 200,000 DVDs of information. 
 
 This store is so vast that it will keep professional astronomers busy for decades. 
 
 ""To think that you see individual scientific papers coming out now that talk about just a single object - a single star or exoplanet. And very soon, because of Gaia, we will have information on a billion objects. What will the scientific literature look like then?"" pondered Dr Michael Perryman, the former Gaia Esa project scientist now affiliated to Princeton University, US. 
 
 ""Of course, there will be big statistical projects you can tackle with this data, but it is clear the scale of Gaia means this information is not going to be superseded for a very long time,"" he told BBC News. 
 
 As the Earth goes around the Sun, relatively nearby stars appear to move against the 'fixed' stars that are even further away 
 
 Because we know the Sun-Earth distance, we can use the parallax angle to work out the distance to the target star 
 
 But such angles are very small - less than one arcsecond for the nearest stars, or 0.05% of the full Moon's diameter 
 
 Gaia will make repeat observations to reduce measurement errors down to seven micro-arcseconds for the very brightest stars 
 
 Parallaxes are used to anchor other, more indirect techniques on the 'ladder' deployed to measure the most far-flung distances 
 
 It will though offer ample scope for citizen scientists to mine Gaia's data to make their own discoveries, and a number of crowdsourcing projects to facilitate this activity will get under way next year. 
 
 Gaia is the result of an enormous industrial effort led by Astrium satellites in Toulouse, France. ""For this masterpiece, for this jewel of space hardware, Astrium gathered and led an industrial consortium made up of 50 companies - 47 European, three North American,"" said CEO Eric Beranger. 
 
 ""Coming to [French Guiana] and seeing our satellite lifting off brings me huge emotion. So much effort, dedication and ingenuity captured in just a few minutes.""

91,"There’s no use trying to skirt around this, so let’s cut straight to the chase: A Colorado Springs woman has been taking big craps in front of someone’s house for a few weeks now. They’re calling her the Mad Pooper and she won’t stop. The cops are involved. It appears to be some sort of revenge pooping. I hope you enjoy this report from local CBS outlet KKTV as much as I did. 
 
 
 
 The goofy guy who said, “It’s just not a natural thing we do in our society, to drop your trousers and, uh, and relieve yourself right there when you know there’s people around,” really cut to the heart of the thing. We called the Colorado Springs Police Department, who confirmed that this is indeed a real case being handled by the CSPD’s Falcon Division. 
 
 Pretty much every quote from this story is magnificent: 
 
 “They are like, ‘There’s a lady taking a poop!’ So I come outside, and I’m like ... ‘are you serious?’” Budde recalled. “’Are you really taking a poop right here in front of my kids!?’ She’s like, ‘Yeah, sorry!’” 
 
 “It’s abnormal, it’s not something I’ve seen in my career,” Sgt. Johnathan Sharketti said. “For someone to repeatedly do such a thing ... it’s uncharted territory for me.” 
 
 “There’s plenty of public restrooms less than a block away from where she’s targeting. This is intentional.”

 As the TV report indicated, the woman has also been sighted pooping in a Walgreens and in nearby backyards. The presence of bathrooms close by and her propensity for repeat turds clearly show that she doesn’t care about signs, warnings, completing the rest of her runs with mudbutt, or the stigma of a society unenamored with joggers taking drive-by shits in and around their properties. She even brings her own toilet paper. The only questions that remain are mechanical and motivational. 
 
 Is she a world-class crapper, who can shit dozens of times a day and therefore needs the variety? Is she motivated by some animal instinct to befoul as much of the city as physiologically possible? Why doesn’t she pick more prominent targets? Is the Colorado Springs PD ready for retaliatory poopings? What did the Budde family do to her? Is this revenge? 
 
 If you know the Mad Pooper or, better yet, if you are the Mad Pooper, please send me an email.

 A local family has spent weeks trying to get a mystery woman they've dubbed ""The Mad Pooper"" to stop defecating in their neighborhood, right outside their house. 
 
 Cathy Budde of Colorado Springs says her kids caught the woman first mid-squat, pants down and unashamed. 
 
 ""They are like, 'There's a lady taking a poop!' So I come outside, and I'm like ... 'are you serious?'"" Budde recalled. ""'Are you really taking a poop right here in front of my kids!?' She's like, 'Yeah, sorry!'"" 
 
 The family says it was just the first time it actually caught the runner doing it, but it wouldn't be the last. Budde estimates the runner leaves behind human waste at least once a week. She says ""The Mad Pooper"" has been at it for the last seven weeks. 
 
 She can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation. 
 
 ""Two other times we've caught her -- caught her yesterday -- she changed up her time a little bit because she knew I was watching,"" Budde said. 
 
 Now the Colorado Springs Police Department is involved. The department is just as baffled. 
 
 ""It's abnormal, it's not something I've seen in my career,"" Sgt. Johnathan Sharketti said. ""For someone to repeatedly do such a thing ... it's uncharted territory for me."" 
 
 Officers have asked Budde to take photos of the woman to help identify her. They say the runner could be facing charges of indecent exposure and public defecation. 
 
 ""I put a sign on the wall that's like 'please, I'm begging you, please stop.' ... She ran by it like 15 times yesterday, and she still pooped,"" Budde admits, defeated. 
 
 Budde family members say one of the worst parts is they can't figure out the woman's motives. 
 
 ""There's plenty of public restrooms less than a block away from where she's targeting. This is intentional."" 
 
 Now they're hoping this story and photos posted online will help flush her out.

 The Oso man suspected of killing his neighbors is now in an Arizona jail after being arrested in Mexico. 
 
 John B. Reed, the suspect in the murders of Monique Patenaude and Patrick Shunn of Oso, has been on the run from Snohomish County authorities since April 11, the date of the suspected murders, a sheriff’s news release says. 
 
 According to the U.S. Marshal’s Office, deputy marshals have been working investigative leads with Mexican authorities from Policia ESTATAL Investigadora in Sonora, Mexico, to determine the location of Reed. 
 
 He was discovered July 22 and expelled to the United States by Mexican authorities for violation of immigration laws. 
 
 He was taken into custody at the border by U.S. officials and booked into the Pima County Jail in Arizona. 
 
 It is unknown at this time when Reed might be extradited to Washington state. 
 
 Jana Hecla, who owns the Oso General Store, said Friday that it was fitting Reed was caught today, the same day Shunn and Patenaude were laid to rest in Oregon. 
 
 “It was a blessing for their family and friends to get some closure,” she said. 
 
 Hecla said anyone who knew Reed had to be surprised. “We didn’t think he’d be taken alive,” she said. 
 
 Hecla said she was impressed with the persistence of law enforcement. It took on the community’s mantra that, “You will pay for this.” 
 
 “It’s a resounding relief that he is detained, and he is going to be held accountable,” she said. 
 
 Hecla said she normally doesn’t have the characteristic of being a vigilante, but you never know “until it happens close to home.” 
 
 “You shouldn’t live in fear of your neighbors,” she said. “Our hearts are still broken.” 
 
 Tony Reed, John’s brother, was on the run, too, until he surrendered to U.S. authorities May 16, while in Mexico. 
 
 After surrendering, his charges were reduced from first-degree murder. He has subsequently pled guilty to two counts of rendering criminal assistance for his part in helping John dispose of Patenaude's and Shunn’s bodies. 
 
 Reed's parents, 81-year-old Clyde and 77-year-old Faye, were taken arrested on the same charge. Both reportedly admitted they provided a vehicle to John and Tony to flee the area. They also admitted to transferring the title from John's truck, believed to have been used in the murders, to Faye. They also admitted to having provided financial assistance to their sons. 
 
 The Marshals Service was offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to Reed’s capture and arrest. Two charges of first-degree homicide have been filed against Reed for the execution-style murders of 45-year-old Shunn and his wife, 46-year-old Patenaude. 
 
 Tony helped detectives locate the gravesite of Shunn and Patanaude, who were both shot to death.

He is now in the Pima County Jail. ||||| Newly released court records outline long-running hostilities between neighbors that may have led to the disappearances of an Arlington couple now presumed slain, and two brothers who are being sought as suspects. 
 
 A former neighbor now wanted in the presumed slayings of a missing Arlington couple previously threatened to shoot the husband and wife for cutting brush between their two properties, newly released court records show. 
 
 John Blaine Reed, 53, who shared a common driveway with Patrick Shunn and his wife, Monique Patenaude, “reportedly stated he would shoot or assault them if they didn’t leave” him alone, investigators wrote in an affidavit for a search warrant. 
 
 Reed’s alleged threat, which Shunn later reported in 2013 to Snohomish County sheriff’s deputies, was just part of an “ongoing and constant” dispute between the couple and Reed, whom investigators describe in records as a disgruntled landowner angered by the response to the deadly landslide near Oso that left 43 people dead in 2014. 
 
 The couple had filed a lawsuit two years ago over alleged threats and harassment by other neighbors, but that suit didn’t name Reed as a defendant. Shunn and Patenaude avoided naming Reed because they didn’t want to irk him, the couple’s former lawyer said Monday. 
 
 But in recent weeks, Reed apparently became angry with the couple after Patenaude complained to a county official that Reed had been illegally squatting on his former property, which he recently had sold to the county, the records say. 
 
 The new details about the case, contained in 73 pages of detectives’ search-warrant records released Monday, shed new light on why investigators are now searching for Reed and his younger brother, Tony C. Reed, 49, in connection with the couple’s presumed homicides. 
 
 Both men remained at large Monday, while investigators continued searching the remote woods near Oso for the couple’s bodies near the area where their vehicles were found last week. 
 
 The couple’s disappearance came about two weeks after Reed sold his condemned property to Snohomish County as part of a buyout for landowners affected by the deadly slide. 
 
 Some time after the county took over the property on March 31, Patenaude complained to a county parks official that Reed still was “squatting” in his former home, the records say. 
 
 Based on her complaint, Snohomish County “trespassed” Reed from the former property — an action that made him “very unhappy,” a county official recently recalled to detectives investigating the case. 
 
 The records released Monday also detail a string of physical evidence and witness statements that may tie the brothers to the couple’s disappearance. 
 
 Michael and Suzanne Loo, friends and neighbors of the couple, reported them missing a week ago after finding the couple’s dog running loose and their livestock untended, but no sign of Shunn and Patenaude or their vehicles at their home. 
 
 After reporting them missing April 12, Suzanne Loo later saw the Reed brothers that day trying to access John Reed’s former property, the records say. Reed allegedly told Loo they were there to move personal items; the brothers were traveling in Reed’s “red, lifted pickup truck,” Loo later told investigators.

 On Thursday, a search-and-rescue helicopter team spotted the couple’s extensively damaged vehicles next to a clear-cut area north of the couple’s 20-acre farm along the Stillaguamish River. The vehicles, a Land Rover and Jeep Wrangler, had been pushed or driven over an embankment and partly concealed by cut branches. The Land Rover apparently became stuck on the edge of the embankment, a mound, and appeared to have been “pried” over it with a digging tool or lever, records say. 
 
 At the top of the embankment, investigators also found a new tarp spread out over a mound covered with cut branches and debris, the affidavit states. 
 
 Near the vehicles, investigators later recovered an Ace Hardware bag, an ax, rubber gloves, tarps, posts and other items, records say. Detectives traced the items to a hardware store in Arlington, whose owner recalled John Reed as a frequent customer who he’d seen at the store April 13. 
 
 Armed with a warrant, detectives searched Reed’s property Saturday, finding “red stains, which appeared to be dried blood,” in and around the bathtub and a pair of coveralls with apparent blood stains. They also found two rifles and ammunition, and gloves, a tarp and posts similar to those recovered near the couple’s vehicles, the records say. 
 
 Investigators also obtained video from a property owner’s security camera along a road heading toward where the vehicles were found. It captured a Jeep and a Land Rover being driven up the road at 3:31 a.m. on April 12 — hours after Shunn and Patenaude were last seen, records say. 
 
 About six hours later, the camera also recorded a red Toyota pickup with a winch on the front headed up the road with what may have been a post in the back, the records say. 
 
 Based on the evidence, Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary announced Sunday investigators believe the couple are dead and named the Reed brothers as suspects in their slayings. 
 
 The brothers are both felons who are considered armed and dangerous, the sheriff said. 
 
 John Reed’s red Toyota pickup was recovered Saturday in the garage of his parents’ Ellensburg home, the records show. The truck’s ownership registration had been transferred to the name of Reed’s mother one day earlier, the records say. 
 
 The brothers now may be driving their parents’ red 2007 Volkswagen EOS coupe with Washington plates AXH5106. 
 
 Two months after the deadly landslide in 2014, John Reed shared his experiences of witnessing and surviving the catastrophe with The Seattle Times. 
 
 He said then he knew the rugged terrain around Oso extensively. He also noted he was drawn to his lot by the privacy he enjoyed at the end of the road, and noted he had no plans to move off his land, where he had lived for 18 years. 
 
 But the disaster apparently took an emotional toll. 
 
 After the mudslide, deputies took a report that Reed had threatened FEMA workers at the Oso Fire Hall “in regard to his displeasure about the landslide and associated response.” 
 
 The deputies were told “Reed made a loud comment about driving his truck through the building and taking everyone out with him,” the warrant records say. 
 
 Reed later explained he was very upset that his slide-damaged driveway hadn’t been fixed, saying he feared if he didn’t get money to fix it, his property would be condemned. 
 
 A day after Shunn and Patenaude were reported missing, former deputy Bruce Cheek, who lives on the same road as the missing couple, contacted a detective to describe an incident involving John Reed shortly after the 2014 slide. 
 
 “Cheek stated Reed was expressing extreme anger about the slide and named a list of people whom Reed blamed (Cheek did not remember the names),” the records state. “Cheek stated Reed expressed in a serious tone that he was capable of killing people without any problems, he could shoot them and then `they’ would never be able to locate the bodies as he (Reed) would get rid of them in the area of timber above the slide area.” ||||| John Reed is accused of killing an Arlington couple in April. Police believe he fled to Mexico shortly thereafter. 
 
 John B. Reed, suspected of killing an Arlington couple in April, has been captured in Mexico. 
 
 Reed, 53, was captured by Mexican authorities on Friday, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office. 
 
 Authorities from the Policia Estatal Investigadora located Reed in Sonora, Mexico, and expelled him from the country for violation of Mexican immigration laws, the sheriff’s office said. He was taken into custody at the border by the U.S. Marshals Service and booked into Pima County Jail in Arizona. 
 
 It was not immediately known when Reed would be extradited to Washington. 
 
 Police say Reed fled to Mexico after killing his former neighbors Patrick Shunn, 45, and his wife, Monique Patenaude, 46, in April. He is charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Reed reportedly had a property dispute with the couple and had threatened them, investigators say. 
 
 Reed’s brother, Tony Reed, and their parents have been charged with helping John Reed. 
 
 Tony Reed pleaded guilty in June to two counts of rendering criminal assistance. Parents Clyde Reed, 81, and Faye Reed, 77, have each been charged with one count of rendering criminal assistance. 
 
 According to prosecutors, John Reed shot Patenaude three times after she returned home from running errands in Arlington during the late-morning hours of April 11. Shunn was fatally shot once in the midafternoon of the same day when he returned home from work, charging documents say. 
 
 Reed drove that evening to Ellensburg, where his parents and brother live. He stayed there for an hour and returned with Tony Reed, arriving back at the slain couple’s property around midnight, according to the charges. 
 
 Tony Reed, 49, later told detectives he saw Patenaude’s body in her Jeep while Shunn’s body was inside his Land Rover, according to the documents. 
 
 The brothers waited until 3 a.m. April 12 to each drive a vehicle up North Brooks Creek Road, where they buried the bodies and then dumped the Jeep and Land Rover over a steep embankment several miles from the burial site, the papers say. 
 
 The brothers walked back to John Reed’s old property and, over the next two days, allegedly tried to conceal and destroy evidence of the killings. 
 
 John and Tony Reed arrived back in Ellensburg no later than April 14, when John Reed attempted to cash a $96,595 cashier’s check — money paid to him for his property after the Oso landslide. 
 
 But the bank wouldn’t cash such a large check, so Reed had the payment split into five separate checks. Reed had two checks for $14,000 each made payable to his parents, and a $40,000 check made payable to him. He signed that larger check over to his father. 
 
 Reed’s father was seen on a surveillance video with his son at the bank during the transaction. 
 
 On April 15, Reed and his mother went to the state Department of Licensing office in Ellensburg, where he transferred the title of his red pickup to her. 
 
 She later “gifted” her son her vehicle, which he and his brother drove to Arizona, leaving it behind before they crossed into Mexico. 
 
 Clyde and Faye Reed deposited three checks totaling $68,000 into their bank accounts, only to learn Snohomish County sheriff’s detectives had frozen the money so it couldn’t be accessed, authorities say. 
 
 Shunn and Patenaude’s bodies were discovered in May after Tony Reed surrendered to authorities and led investigators to their graves. 
 
 Also Friday, relatives of the couple hosted a memorial for Patenaude and Shunn at Willamette National Cemetery outside Portland. Shunn was in the military, according to the event’s Facebook page, so the afternoon gathering began as a military-style funeral. After that, a pastor conducted a service, the page says. 
 
 “They were always together, cremated together, and we want to keep it that way for the memorial to finally put them to rest,” the page says. 
 
 Responding to news of Friday’s arrest, Shunn’s brother, Erik Shunn, posted on Facebook: “What a gift on the day of Pat and Monique’s memorial.”","– After more than three months on the run, the Washington man accused of killing his former neighbors has been arrested. John B. Reed was captured in Mexico on Friday and kicked out of that country for violating its immigration laws, the Seattle Times reports. US Marshals arrested him when he crossed the border in Arizona, where he is now in jail. Reed was captured on the same day a memorial was held for Patrick Shunn, 45, and his wife, 46-year-old Monique Patenaude. “It was a blessing for their family and friends to get some closure,” neighbor Jana Hecla tells the Marysville Globe. The US Marshals had been working with Mexican authorities in Sonora to locate Reed. “We didn’t think he’d be taken alive,” Hecla says. According to reports, Reed allegedly shot and killed Patenaude on the morning of April 11, and then shot and killed Shunn later in the day. Reed's brother, Tony Reed, allegedly helped dispose of the bodies and the couple's vehicles. Tony Reed, who turned himself in last month after also fleeing to Mexico, has pleaded guilty to rendering criminal assistance, according to the AP. The brothers' elderly parents also face charges connected to allegedly helping their sons flee the country. According to the AP, Shunn and Patenaude lived on a 21-acre property near the rural community of Oso, where a landslide destroyed dozens of houses and killed 43 people in 2014. They shared a driveway with Reed, who at one time threatened to shoot the couple, per an earlier Seattle Times report. In the weeks before the killings, Patenaude reportedly complained to the county that Reed was squatting on the land he had recently sold to the county.","<pad> John Reed, were arrested in Mexico on Friday.</s>",0.07368420952908589,0.021978021340417844,0.07368420952908589

 Deonte Smith, a senior 911 operator in Clayton County, says he was just doing his job and the victim deserves all the credit for keeping her wits about her while she was being attacked and sexually assaulted. 
 
 “I would like to meet you in person. I really want to. I’m thankful for your quick thinking,” Smith said of the victim. 
 
 He also says she got some help from above because if she had called a few seconds later he would have been on break. 
 
 ”Honestly I'd say divine intervention,” Smith said. “I was the only guy on the floor that night. The other guy we had had just left not too long before the call came in.” 
 
 The caller said she was being assaulted by Robert Timothy Giles. Officers say Giles kidnapped the victim and brought her to a novelty store parking lot on Tara Boulevard around 4 a.m. Monday. 
 
 Police say Giles forced the victim to call her boyfriend so he could listen in on the assault. 
 
 The victim instead called 911 and Smith pretended to be her boyfriend. 
 
 “(It was) the most extreme call of my career,” Smith said. 
 
 Police say Smith talked to Giles and tried to get him to stop the assault. Smith told Channel 2’s Tom Jones the call upset him. 
 
 “Very much so. I have a daughter, I have a sister and I have a mom. (It’s) difficult, it really is. I was really upset,” Smith said. 
 
 But Smith said he had to remain professional. He dispatched police and when they arrived, officers say Giles was still assaulting the victim.

 A Practical Attack against MDM Solutions Spyphones are surveillance tools surreptitiously planted on a users handheld device. While malicious mobile applications mainly phone fraud applications distributed through common application channels - target the typical consumer, spyphones are nation states tool of attacks. Why? Once installed, the software stealthy gathers information such as text messages (SMS), geo-location information, emails and even surround-recordings. How are these mobile cyber-espionage attacks carried out? In this engaging session, we present a novel proof-of-concept attack technique which bypass traditional mobile malware detection measures- and even circumvent common Mobile Device Management (MDM) features, such as encryption. 
 
 A Tale of One Software Bypass of Windows 8 Secure Boot Windows 8 Secure Boot based on UEFI 2.3.1 Secure Boot is an important step towards securing platforms from malware compromising boot sequence before the OS. However, there are certain mistakes platform vendors shouldn't make which can completely undermine protections offered by Secure Boot. We will demonstrate an example of full software bypass of Windows 8 Secure Boot due to such mistakes on some of the latest platforms and explain how those mistakes can be avoided. 
 
 Above My Pay Grade: Cyber Response at the National Level Incident response is usually a deeply technical forensic investigation and mitigation for an individual organization. But for incidents that are not merely cyber crime but truly national security events, such as large-scale disruptive attacks that could be acts of war by another nation, the process is completely dissimilar, needing a different kind of thinking. This talk will discuss exactly how, detailing the flow of national security incident response in the United States using the scenario of a major attack on the finance sector. The response starts at individual banks and exchanges, through the public-private sector information sharing processes (like FS-ISAC). Treasury handles the financial side of the crisis while DHS tackles the technical. If needed, the incident can be escalated to the military and president especially if the incident becomes especially disruptive or destructive. The talk examines this flow and the actions and decisions within the national security apparatus, concluding with the pros and cons of this approach and comparing it to the process in other key countries.

 Android: one root to own them all This presentation is a case study showcasing the technical details of Android security bug 8219321, disclosed to Google in February 2013. The vulnerability involves discrepancies in how Android applications are cryptographically verified & installed, allowing for APK code modification without breaking the cryptographic signature; that in turn is a simple step away from system access & control. The vulnerability affects a wide number of Android devices, across generations & architectures, with little to no modifications of the exploit. The presentation will review how the vulnerability was located, how an exploit was created, and why the exploit works, giving you insight into the vulnerability problem and the exploitation process. Working PoCs for major Android device vendors will be made available to coincide with the presentation.

 BinaryPig - Scalable Malware Analytics in Hadoop Over the past 2.5 years Endgame received 20M samples of malware equating to roughly 9.5 TB of binary data. In this, we’re not alone. McAfee reports that it currently receives roughly 100,000 malware samples per day and received roughly 10M samples in the last quarter of 2012 [1]. Its total corpus is estimated to be about 100M samples. VirusTotal receives between 300k and 600k unique files per day, and of those roughly one-third to half are positively identified as malware [2]. This huge volume of malware offers both challenges and opportunities for security research especially applied machine learning. Endgame performs static analysis on malware in order to extract feature sets used for performing large-scale machine learning. Since malware research has traditionally been the domain of reverse engineers, most existing malware analysis tools were designed to process single binaries or multiple binaries on a single computer and are unprepared to confront terabytes of malware simultaneously. There is no easy way for security researchers to apply static analysis techniques at scale; companies and individuals that want to pursue this path are forced to create their own solutions. Our early attempts to process this data did not scale well with the increasing flood of samples. As the size of our malware collection increased, the system became unwieldy and hard to manage, especially in the face of hardware failures. Over the past two years we refined this system into a dedicated framework based on Hadoop so that our large-scale studies are easier to perform and are more repeatable over an expanding dataset. To address this problem, we will present our open framework, BinaryPig, as well as some example uses of this technology to perform a multiyear, multi-terabyte, multimillion-sample malware census. This framework is built over Apache Hadoop, Apache Pig, and Python. It addresses many issues of scalable malware processing, including dealing with increasingly large data sizes, improving workflow development speed, and enabling parallel processing of binary files with most pre-existing tools. It is also modular and extensible, in the hope that it will aid security researchers and academics in handling ever-larger amounts of malware. In addition, we will demonstrate the results of our exploration and the techniques used to derive these results. The framework, analysis modules, and some example applications will be released as open source (Apache 2.0 License) at Blackhat. http://www.darkreading.com/identityandaccessmanagement/167901114/security/attacksbrea ches/240006702/mcafeecloseto100knewmalwaresamplesperdayinq2.html https://www.virustotal.com/en/statistics/ as of 4/9/2013 
 
 BIOS Security In 2011 the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) released a draft of special publication 800-155. This document provides a more detailed description than the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) PC client specification for content that should be measured in the BIOS to provide an adequate Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM). To justify the importance of 800-155, in this talk we look at the implementation of the SRTM from a vendor's pre-800-155 laptop. We discuss how the BIOS and thus SRTM can be manipulated either due to a configuration that does not enable signed BIOS updates, or via an exploit we discovered that allows for BIOS reflash even in the presence of a signed update requirement. We also show how a 51 byte patch to the SRTM can cause it to provide a forged measurement to the TPM indicating that the BIOS is pristine. If a TPM Quote is used to query the boot state of the system, this TPM-signed falsification will then serve as the root of misplaced trust. We also show how reflashing the BIOS may not necessarily remove this trust-subverting malware. To fix the un-trustworthy SRTM we apply an academic technique whereby the BIOS software indicates its integrity through a timing side-channel. 
 
 Black-Box Assessment of Pseudorandom Algorithms Last year at Black Hat, Argyros and Kiayias devastated all things pseudorandom in open-source PHP applications. This year, we're bringing PRNG attacks to the masses. We'll point out flaws in many of the most common non-cryptographic pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and examine how to identify a PRNG based on a black-box analysis of application output. In many cases, most or all of the PRNG's internal state can be recovered, enabling determination of past output and prediction of future output. We'll present algorithms that run many orders of magnitude faster than a brute-force search, including reversing and seeking the PRNG stream in constant time. Finally, of course, we'll demonstrate everything and give away our tool so that you can perform the attacks during your own assessments. 
 
 BlackBerryOS 10 from a security perspective BlackBerry prides itself with being a strong contender in the field of secure mobile platforms. While traditionally BlackBerryOS was based on a proprietary RTOS with a JVM propped on top, the architecture was completely overhauled with BlackBerryOS 10. Now the base operating system is the formerly off-the-shelf RTOS QNX, which doesn't exactly have an excellent security track record. Moreover, for the first time in BBOS history, native code applications are allowed on the platform. This talk will present an analysis of the attack surface of BBOS 10, considering both ways to escalate privileges locally and routes for remote entry. Moreover, since exploitation is only half the work of offense, we'll show ways for rootkits to persist on the device. Last but not least we will settle whether BlackBerry Balance really holds what it promises: are mobile devices really ready to securely separate crucial business data from Angry Birds?

 Bluetooth Smart: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, and The Fix! Bluetooth Smart, AKA Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE), is a new modulation mode and link-layer packet format defined in Bluetooth 4.0. A new class of low-power devices and high-end smartphones are already on the market using this protocol. Applications include everything from fitness devices to wireless door locks. The Good: Bluetooth Smart is well-designed and good at what it does. We explain its workings from the PHY layer (raw RF) all the way to the application layer. The Bad: Bluetooth Smart's key exchange is weak. We will perform a live demonstration of sniffing and recovering encryption keys using open source tools we developed. The Ugly: A passive eavesdropper can decrypt all communications with a sniffed encryption key using our tools. The Fix: We implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to exchange a key in-band. This backward-compatible fix renders the protocol secure against passive eavesdroppers.

 Bochspwn: Identifying 0-days via System-wide Memory Access Pattern Analysis Throughout the last two decades, the field of automated vulnerability discovery has evolved into the advanced state we have today: effective dynamic analysis is achieved with a plethora of complex, privately developed fuzzers dedicated to specific products, file formats or protocols, with source code and binary-level static analysis slowly catching up, yet already proving useful in specific scenarios. Due to market demand and general ease of access, the efforts have been primarily focused around client software, effectively limiting kernel code coverage to a few generic syscall and IOCTL fuzzers. Considering the current impact of ring-0 security on the overall system security posture and number of kernel-specific bug classes, we would like to propose a novel, dynamic approach to locating subtle kernel security flaws that would likely otherwise remain unnoticed for years. The presentation will introduce the concept of identifying vulnerabilities in operating systems’ kernels by employing dynamic CPU-level instrumentation over a live system session, on the example of using memory access patterns to extract information about potential race conditions in interacting with user-mode memory. We will discuss several different ways to implement the idea, with special emphasis on the “Bochspwn” project we developed last year and successfully used to discover around 50 local elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel so far, with many of them already addressed in the ms13-016, ms13-017, ms13-031 and ms13-036 security bulletins. The tool itself will be open-sourced during the conference, thus allowing a wider audience to test and further develop the approach. 
 
 Bugalyze.com - Detecting Bugs Using Decompilation and Data Flow Analysis Bugwise is a free online web service at www.bugalyze.com to perform static analysis of binary executables to detect software bugs and vulnerabilities. It detects bugs using a combination of decompilation to recover high level information, and data flow analysis to discover issues such as use-after-frees and double frees. Bugwise has been developed over the past several years and is implemented as a series of modules in a greater system that performs other binary analysis tasks such as malware detection. This entire system consists of more than 100,000 lines of C++ code and a scalable load balanced multi-node Amazon EC2 cluster. In this talk, I will explain how Bugwise works. The system is still in the development stage but has successfully found a number of real bugs and vulnerabilities in Debian Linux. This includes double free, use-after-free, and over 50 getenv(,strcpy) bugs statically found from scanning the entire Debian repository.

 Buying into the Bias: Why Vulnerability Statistics Suck Academic researchers, journalists, security vendors, software vendors, and other enterprising... uh... enterprises often analyze vulnerability statistics using large repositories of vulnerability data, such as CVE, OSVDB, and others. These stats are claimed to demonstrate trends in disclosure, such as the number or type of vulnerabilities, or their relative severity. Worse, they are often (mis)used to compare competing products to assess which one offers the best security. Most of these statistical analyses are faulty or just pure hogwash. They use the easily-available, but drastically misunderstood data to craft irrelevant questions based on wild assumptions, while never figuring out (or even asking us about) the limitations of the data. This leads to a wide variety of bias that typically goes unchallenged, that ultimately forms statistics that make headlines and, far worse, are used for budget and spending. As maintainers of two well-known vulnerability information repositories, we're sick of hearing about sloppy research after it's been released, and we're not going to take it any more. We will give concrete examples of the misuses and abuses of vulnerability statistics over the years, revealing which studies do it right (rather, the least wrong), and how to judge future claims so that you can make better decisions based on these ""studies."" We will cover all the kinds of documented and undocumented bias that can exist in a vulnerability data source; how variations in counting hurt comparative analyses; and all the ways that vulnerability information is observed, cataloged, and annotated. Steve will provide vendor-neutral, friendly, supportive suggestions to the industry. Jericho will do no such thing. 
 
 Combating the Insider Threat at the FBI: Real World Lessons Learned What do T.S. Eliot, Puxatony Phil, eugenics, DLP, crowdsourcing, black swans, and narcissism have in common? They are all key concepts for an effective insider threat program. Come hear how the FBI uses a surprising variety of methods to combat insiders. In this session the FBI will provide five key lessons learned about effective detection and deterrence techniques used in the FBI's insider threat program developed over the last decade. The talk will provide insight on how our nation's premier law enforcement agency is detecting and deterring insider threat using a variety of techniques and technologies. This session will provide unique lessons learned from building a real world, operational insider threat monitoring and response program.

 Compromising Industrial Facilities From 40 Miles Away The evolution of wireless technologies has allowed industrial automation and control systems (IACS) to become strategic assets for companies that rely on processing plants and facilities in industries such as energy production, oil, gas, water, utilities, refining, and petrochemical distribution and processing. Effective wireless sensor networks have enabled these companies to reduce implementation, maintenance, and equipment costs and enhance personal safety by enabling new topologies for remote monitoring and administration in hazardous locations. However, the manner in which sensor networks handle and control cryptographic keys is very different from the way in which they are handled in traditional business networks. Sensor networks involve large numbers of sensor nodes with limited hardware capabilities, so the distribution and revocation of keys is not a trivial task. In this presentation, we review the most commonly implemented key distribution schemes, their weaknesses, and how vendors can more effectively align their designs with key distribution solutions. We also demonstrate some attacks that exploit key distribution vulnerabilities, which we recently discovered in every wireless device developed over the past few years by three leading industrial wireless automation solution providers. These devices are widely used by many energy, oil, water, nuclear, natural gas, and refined petroleum companies. An untrusted user or group within a 40-mile range could read from and inject data into these devices using radio frequency (RF) transceivers. A remotely and wirelessly exploitable memory corruption bug could disable all the sensor nodes and forever shut down an entire facility. When sensors and transmitters are attacked, remote sensor measurements on which critical decisions are made can be modified. This can lead to unexpected, harmful, and dangerous consequences. 
 
 CreepyDOL: Cheap, Distributed Stalking Are you a person with a few hundred dollars and an insatiable curiosity about your neighbors, who is fed up with the hard work of tracking your target's every move in person? Good news! You, too, can learn the intimate secrets and continuous physical location of an entire city from the comfort of your desk! CreepyDOL is a distributed sensing and data mining system combining very-low-cost sensors, open-source software, and a focus on user experience to provide personnel identification, tracking, and analysis without sending any data to the targets. In other words, it takes you from hand-crafted, artisan skeeviness to big-box commodity creepiness, and enables government-level total awareness for about $500 of off-the-shelf hardware.

 Defending Networks with Incomplete Information: A Machine Learning Approach Let's face it: we may win some battles, but we are losing the war pretty badly. Regardless of the advances in malware and targeted attacks detection technologies, our top security practitioners can only do so much in a 24-hour day; even less, if you let them eat and sleep. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of capable people to do ""simple"" security monitoring effectively, let alone complex incident detection and response. Enter the use of Machine Learning as a way to automatically prioritize and classify potential events and attacks as something could potentially be blocked automatically, is clearly benign, or is really worth the time of your analyst. On this presentation we will present publicly for the first time an actual implementation of those concepts, in the form of a free-to-use web service. It leverages OSINT and knowledge about the spatial distribution of the Internet to generate a fluid and constantly updated classifier that pinpoints areas of interest on submitted network traffic logs.

 Dissecting CSRF Attacks & Countermeasures Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) remains a significant threat to web apps and user data. Current countermeasures like request nonces can be cumbersome to deploy correctly and difficult to apply to a site retroactively. Detecting these vulns with automated tools can be equally difficult to do accurately. The presentation starts with a demonstration of how to model attacks to validate whether different kinds of countermeasures are implemented correctly. It includes a tool and code to show how to detect these vulns with few false positives. Then we explore how CSRF could be prevented at the HTTP layer by proposing a new header-based policy, similar to the intent of Content Security Policy. This new policy introduces a concept called Storage Origin Security (SOS) for cookies and session objects that foils many kinds of CSRF attacks without burdening the site with HTML modifications. The solution focuses on simplicity to make it easier to retrofit on current apps, but requires browsers to support a new client-side security control. We show how this trade-off could be a quicker way to improving security on the web. 
 
 End-to-End Analysis of a Domain Generating Algorithm Malware Family Select malware families have used Domain Generating Algorithms (DGAs) over the past few years in an effort to evade traditional domain blacklists, allow for fast-flux domain registration and usage, and evade analysts’ abilities to predict attackers’ control servers. While novel work has been done by both private industry and academia with respect to detecting DGA-related network traffic, this presentation demonstrates end-to-end analysis of a DGA malware family, from binary deobfuscation to DGA analysis, to sinkholing, to domain registrant research, to attribution of the malware’s author and accomplices. The malware family discussed in this presentation has thousands of active variants currently running on the Internet and has managed to stay off of the radar of all antivirus firms. This presentation will bring to light how this malware is tied to an underground campaign that has been active for at least the past six years.

 Energy Fraud and Orchestrated Blackouts: Issues with Wireless Metering Protocols (wM-Bus) Government requirements, new business cases, and consumer behavioral changes drive energy market players to improve the overall management of energy infrastructures. While the energy infrastructure is steadily maintained and improved, some significant changes have been introduced to the power grids of late. Actually, the significance of the changes could be compared to the early days of the Internet where computers started to become largely interconnected. Naturally, questions arise whether a grid composed of so many interacting components can still meet today's requirements for reliability, availability, and privacy. Nations absolutely recognize the criticality of the energy infrastructure for their economic and political stability. Therefore, various initiatives to ensure reliability and availability of their energy infrastructures are being driven at nation as well as at nation union levels. In order to contribute to the evaluation of national cyber security risks, the author decided to conduct a security analysis in the field of smart energy. Utilities have started to introduce new field device technology - smart meters. As the name implies, smart meters do support many more use cases than any old conventional electricity meter did. Not only does the new generation of meters support fine granular remote data reading, but it also facilitates remote load control or remote software updates. Hence, to build a secure advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), communication protocols must support bi-directional data transmission and protect meter data and control commands in transit. Therefore, analysis of smart metering protocols is of great interest. The work presented has analyzed the security of the Meter Bus (M-Bus) as specified within the relevant standards. The M-Bus is very popular in remote meter reading and has its roots in the heat metering industries. It has continuously been adopted to fit more complex applications during the past twenty years. According to a workshop note, an estimated 15 million devices were relying on the wireless version of M-Bus in 2010. It was analyzed whether smart meters using wireless M-Bus do fit the overall security and reliability needs of the grid or whether such devices might threaten the infrastructure. The M-Bus standard has been analyzed whether it provides effective security mechanisms. It can be stated that wireless M-Bus seems to be robust against deduction of consumption behaviour from the wireless network traffic. For this reason, it is considered privacy-preserving against network traffic analysis. Unfortunately, vulnerabilities have been identified that render that fact obsolete. The findings are mainly related to confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Consequently, smart meters relying on wireless M-Bus and supporting remote disconnects are prone to become subject to an orchestrated remote disconnect which poses a severe risk to the grid. Further issues may lead to zero consumption detection, disclosure of consumption values, and disclosure of encryption keys. Following that, the availability and reliability of the smart grid or at least parts of it may not be guaranteed.

 Exploiting Network Surveillance Cameras Like a Hollywood Hacker This talk will examine 0-day vulnerabilities that can be trivially exploited by remote attackers to gain administrative and root-level access to consumer and enterprise network surveillance cameras manufactured by D-Link, Trendnet, Cisco, IQInvision, Alinking and 3SVision. Thousands of these cameras are Internet accessible, and known to be deployed in homes, businesses, hotels, casinos, banks and prisons, as well as military and industrial facilities. Additionally, a proof-of-concept attack will be demonstrated in which a remote attacker can leverage the described vulnerabilities to freeze and modify legitimate video streams from these cameras, in true Hollywood fashion.

 Evading deep inspection for fun and shell Whether you have a Next Generation Firewall, an IPS, IDS, or a BDS, the security provided by these devices depends on their capability to perform robust TCP/IP reassembly. If this fails, the device can be bypassed. We researched the TCP/IP reassembly capabilities of security boxes and found that their detection can be evaded or pierced through with evasions that apply to the IP & TCP layers. The TCP reassembly capabilities of most security boxes are still poor. Instead of doing proper TCP reassembly, many of the analyzed boxes try to prevent attacks by anomaly detection, for example, by blocking small TCP segments. However, blocking small segments leads to false positives, so this kind of blocking strategy cannot be applied to real traffic without the false positive risk. We also found evasions that allowed the attack to succeed without any logs in the security box, even if all signatures were set to block. 
 
 The Factoring Dead: Preparing for the Cryptopocalypse The last several years has seen an explosion of practical exploitation of widespread cryptographic weaknesses, such as BEAST, CRIME, Lucky 13 and the RC4 bias vulnerabilities. The invention of these techniques requires a lot of hard work, deep knowledge and the ability to generate a pithy acronym, but rarely involves the use of a completely unknown weakness. Cryptography researchers have known about the existence of compression oracles, RC4 biases and problems with CBC mode for years, but the general information security community has been unaware of these dangers until fully working exploits were demonstrated. In this talk, the speakers will explain the latest breakthroughs in the academic crypto community and look ahead at what practical issues could arise for popular cryptosystems. Specifically, we will focus on the latest breakthroughs in discrete mathematics and their potential ability to undermine our trust in the most basic asymmetric primitives, including RSA. We will explain the basic theories behind RSA and the state-of-the-art in large numbering factoring, and how several recent papers may point the way to massive improvements in this area. The talk will then switch to the practical aspects of the doomsday scenario, and will answer the question ""What happens the day after RSA is broken?"" We will point out the many obvious and hidden uses of RSA and related algorithms and outline how software engineers and security teams can operate in a post-RSA world. We will also discuss the results of our survey of popular products and software, and point out the ways in which individuals can prepare for the zombi^H^H^H crypto apocalypse. 
 
 Fact and Fiction: Defending your Medical Devices In the past 18 months we have seen a dramatic increase in research and presentations on the security of medical devices. While this brought much needed attention to the issue, it has also uncovered a great deal of misinformation. This talk is going to tackle those confusing and controversial topics. What’s the reality of patching a medical device? Is it safe to run anti-virus protection on them? You’ll find out in this talk. This presentation will outline a framework on how vendors, buyers, and administrators of medical devices can bring substantive changes in the security of these devices. This talk will also have the unique element of discussing a medical device software bug that InGuardians uncovered. This bug will be discussed in detail and replicated live on stage. InGuardians has worked closely with the FDA on properly documenting and submitting this through their tracking system. This will be covered in full detail so other researchers will know how to properly disclose bugs and vulnerabilities.

 Fully Arbitrary 802.3 Packet Injection: Maximizing the Ethernet Attack Surface It is generally assumed that crafting arbitrary, and sniffing, Fast Ethernet packets can be performed with standard Network Interface Cards (NIC) and generally available packet injection software. However, full control of frame values such as the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) or Start-of-Frame delimiter (SFD) have historically required the use of dedicated and costly hardware. Our presentation will dissect Fast Ethernet layer 1 & 2 presenting novel attack techniques supported by an affordable hardware setup with customized firmware which will be publicly released. This research expands the ability to test and analyse the full attack surface of networked embedded systems, with particular attention on automation, automotive and avionics industries. Application of attacks against NICs with hard and soft Media Access Control (MAC) on industrial embedded systems will be explored. We will illustrate how specific frame manipulations can trigger SFD parsing anomalies and Ethernet Packet-In-Packet injection. These results are analyzed in relation to their security relevance and scenarios of application. Finally, conditions for a successful remote Ethernet Packet-In-Packet injection will be discussed and demonstrated for what is believed to be the first time in public. 
 
 Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks Intel's Thunderbolt allows for high-speed data transfers for a variety of peripherals including high-resolution high-bandwidth graphics displays, all using the same physical connection. This convenience comes at a bit of a cost: an external port into your computer's bus and possibly memory! Thunderbolt ports appear on high-end laptops like the MacBook Pro, but also increasingly on PC hardware, and on newer desktop and server motherboards. This proprietary technology is undocumented but problems with it could potentially undermine the privacy and security of users. This talk chronicles process of exploring these risks through a practical exercise in reverse engineering. Experience the tribulations with reversing Thunderbolt chips, understand the attack strategies for exploiting DMA and see the pitfalls one encounters along the way, while gaining a deeper understanding of the risks of this new feature.

 Hacking like in the Movies: Visualizing Page Tables for Local Exploitation A shiny and sparkling way to break user-space ASLR, kernel ASLR and even find driver bugs! Understanding how a specific Operating System organizes its Page Tables allow you to find your own ASLR bypasses and even driver vulnerabilities. We will drop one 0day Android ASLR bypass as an example; you can then break all your other expensive toys yourself. Page Tables are the data structures that map between the virtual address space your programs see to the actual physical addresses identifying locations on your physical RAM chips. We will visualize these data structures for: Windows 8 on x86_64 
 
 Windows 8 RT on ARMv7 
 
 Linux 3.8 on x86_64 
 
 Linux 3.4 on ARMv7 alias Android 4.2 
 
 XNU on x86_64 alias OS X 
 
 XNU on ARMv7 alias iOS Besides showing pretty pictures, we will actually explain what they show and how to interpret commonalities and differences across the same kernel on different architectures. By comparing the page table state on the same architecture across different runs, we will identify static physical mappings created by drivers, which can be useful for DMA attacks (think FireWire or Thunderbolt forensics). Static virtual mappings are even more interesting and can be used for (K)ASLR bypasses. To make a final point, that this is not only nice to look at, we will show how we found a mitigated Android <= 4.0.x generic user-space ASLR bypass. For those interested in actually owning targets, we will show an Android 4.2.2 generic user-space ASLR bypass that also affects other latest Linux/ARM kernels. 
 
 Hacking, Surveilling, and Deceiving victims on Smart TV Smart TVs sold over 80,000,000 units around the world in 2012. This next generation ""smart"" platform is becoming more and more popular. On the other hand, we hardly see security research on Smart TVs. This presentation will cover vulnerabilities we've found on the platform. You can imagine that Smart TVs have almost the exact same attack vectors that PC and Smart Phones have. Also, Smart TVs have interesting new attack surface such as the remote controller. We'll talk about attack points for Smart TV platform and cover security bugs we discovered. This talk will mostly focus on what attackers can do on a hacked Smart TV. For example, expensive Smart TVs have many hardware devices like a Camera or Mic which, if remotely controlled, means bad guys can spy remotely without you knowing. Even more, it is possible to make Smart TVs monitor you 24/7 even though users turn off their TV, meaning #1984 could be done. In addition, we'll point out a difference of viewpoint on leaked information type among PC, Smart Phone and Smart TV. Lastly, we'll give demo of live remote surveillance cam, which is sent to attacker's server at this talk. This talk is an extended version of one, which I gave at CANSECWEST. It will demonstrate a spoofed news story on a hacked Smart TV and possibly TVshing (Smart TV edition of phishing.)

 Hiding @ Depth - Exploring, Subverting and Breaking NAND Flash memory In the world of digital storage, gone are the days of spinning platters and magnetic residue. These technologies have been replaced with electron trapping, small voltage monitoring and a lot of magic. These NAND devices are ubiquitous across our culture; from smart phones to laptops to USB memory sticks to GPS navigation devices. We carry many of these devices in our pockets daily without considering the security implications. The NAND-Xplore project is an attempt to explain how NAND Flash storage functions and to expose logical weaknesses in the hardware and implementation architectures. The project also showcases how the vulnerable underpinnings of NAND hardware can be subverted to hide and persist files on mobile devices. The project will release two open source POC tools for Android, one to inject and hide files on raw NAND based devices and another to find those files. The tools will showcase how advanced malware or other offensive tools could be using NAND to hide peristent files on your devices and how you would go about discovering them. The project also considers how typical forensic software interacts with NAND devices and how those tools can be subverted. Lastly, the talk will cover how remote NAND manipulation can brick devices beyond repair, from Smartphones to SCADA, and how this vulnerability cannot realistically be patched or fixed (Hint: your current tools probably don't work as well as you would like to believe).

 Home Invasion v2.0 - Attacking Network-Controlled Hardware A growing trend in electronics is to have them integrate with your home network in order to provide potentially useful features like automatic updates or to extend the usefulness of existing technologies such as door locks you can open and close from anywhere in the world. What this means for us as security professionals or even just as people living in a world of network-connected devices is that being compromised poses greater risk than before. Once upon a time, a compromise only meant your data was out of your control. Today, it can enable control over the physical world resulting in discomfort, covert audio/video surveillance, physical access or even personal harm. If your door lock or space heater are compromised, you're going to have a very bad day. This talk will discuss the potential risks posed by network-attached devices and even demonstrate new attacks against products on the market today. 
 
 Honey, I’m home!! - Hacking Z-Wave Home Automation Systems Home automation systems provide a centralized control and monitoring function for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting and physical security systems. The central control panel and various household devices such as security sensors and alarm systems are connected with each other to form a mesh network over wireless or wired communication links and act as a “smart home”. As you arrive home, the system can automatically open the garage door, unlock the front door and disable the alarm, light the downstairs, and turn on the TV. According to a study by the consulting firm AMA Research, in 2011, the UK home automation market was worth around £65 million with 12% increase on the previous year. The total number of home automation system installations in the UK is estimated to be 189000 by now. The home automation market in the US was worth approximately $3.2 billion in 2010 and is expected to exceed $5.5 billion in 2016. Zigbee and Z-wave wireless communication protocols are the most common used RF technology in home automation systems. Zigbee is based on an open specification (IEEE 802.15.4) and has been the subject of several academic and practical security researches. Z-wave is a proprietary wireless protocol that works in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical radio band (ISM). It transmits on the 868.42 MHz (Europe) and 908.42MHz (United States) frequencies designed for low-bandwidth data communications in embedded devices such as security sensors, alarms and home automation control panels. Unlike Zigbee, no public security research on Z-Wave protocol was available before our work. Z-wave protocol was only mentioned once during a DefCon 2011 talk when the presenter pointed the possibility of capturing the AES key exchange phase without a demonstration. The Z-Wave protocol is gaining momentum against the Zigbee protocol with regards to home automation. This is partly due to a faster, and somewhat simpler, development process. Another benefit is that it is less subjected to signal interference compared to the Zigbee protocol, which operates on the widely populated 2.4 GHz band shared by both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices. Z-wave chips have 128-bit AES crypto engines, which are used by access control systems, such as door locks, for authenticated packet encryption. An open source implementation of the Z-wave protocol stack, openzwave , is available but it does not support the encryption part as of yet. Our talk will show how the Z-Wave protocol can be subjected to attacks. 
 
 Hot Knives Through Butter: Bypassing Automated Analysis Systems Diamonds are girl’s best friend, prime numbers are mathematician’s best friend and automated analysis systems (AAS) are AV researcher’s best friend. Unfortunately, this fact is known by malware authors and hence techniques to evade automated analysis system are not only becoming an integral part of APT, but also many infamous malwares have resurrected and are using techniques to bypass the automated analysis system to stay under the radar. The infamous Khelios botnet was claimed to be dead in 2011 and got resurrected . To evade the automated analysis system one of the sample aka Trojan Nap found in 2013, was employing SleepEx() API with a 10 minutes time out. Since automated analysis systems are set to execute a sample within a given time frame ,which is in seconds, by employing an extended sleep call, it could prevent an AAS from capturing its behavior. The sample also made a call to the undocumented API NtDelayExecution() for performing an extended sleep calls. As per the report from Mandiant, infamous RAT Poison IVY has extensively been used in the targeted attacks and appeared to have been abandoned in 2008. Trojan UpClicker, reported in December 2012, a wrapper around Poison IVY, employs SetWindowsHookEX() API to hide its malicious activity. By sending 0EH as parameter to the function, the malicious code only gets activated when the left mouse button is clicked and released. Since in AAS there is no human interaction, the code remains dormant bypassing the AAS. PushDo, yet another infamous malware, checks the build number of windows OS. Once it has determined the build number of windows OS. It finds a pointer to PspCreateProcessNotify() API routine to deregister all the callbacks. Once the callbacks have been deregistered, the malware can create or delete processes, bypassing process monitoring module of AAS. Trojan Hastati was designed to wipe out all the hard drives of a computer in Korea. It used GetLocalTime() API to activate itself on March 20th 2013 at 2:00 P.M. If the sample is executed in an AAS before the 20th March 2013, it will not get executed and evades AAS. UpClicker, PushDo, Hastati, Nap are some of the resurrected advanced malware and/or APT which are using anti evasion techniques to evade detections from AAS. In first part of the presentation we provide an exhaustive list of techniques, API’s and the code segments from the APT and active malware, which are being used to bypass the AAS. We will also have live demonstration of some of the anti-analysis techniques, which have emerged in the recent past. In the next part of the presentation we provide an in-depth, technical analysis of the Automated Analysis System technologies available today focusing on computer security aspect. It will provide a comparison framework for different technologies that is consistent, measurable, and understandable by both IT administrators and security specialists. In addition we also explore each of the major commercially available automated analysis system flavors and evaluate their ability to stand against these evasions. We will present an architectural decomposition of automated analysis systems to highlight its advantages and limitations, and historical view on how fast Anti-AAS techniques have been evolved so rapidly recently. This will kick start the conversation on how new vectors that are likely to be used by sophisticated malware to actively target AAS in the future. 
 
 HOW CVSS is DOSsing YOUR PATCHING POLICY (and wasting your money) CVSS score is widely used as the standard-de-facto risk metric for vulnerabilities, to the point that the US Government itself encourages organizations in using it to prioritize vulnerability patching. We tackle this approach by testing the CVSS score in terms of its efficacy as a ""risk score"" and ""prioritization metric."" We test the CVSS against real attack data and as a result, we show that the overall picture is not satisfactory: the (lower-bound) over-investment by using CVSS to choose what vulnerabilities to patch can as high as 300% of an optimal one. We extend the analysis making sure to obtain statistically significant results. However, we present our results at a practical level, focusing on the question: ""does it make sense for you to use CVSS to prioritize your vulnerabilities?""

 How to Grow a TREE (Taint-enabled Reverse Engineering Environment) From CBASS (Cross-platform Binary Automated Symbolic-execution System) Binary analysis techniques from academic research have been introduced into the reverse engineering community as well as research labs that are equipped with lots of computing power. Some program analyses using these techniques have even begun to show up in hacker conferences. But significant limitations remain: No practical toolset delivers analyses of binary programs across multiple platforms (like x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC etc.); 
 
 No practical toolset scales to real-world large programs and automates all aspects of highly sophisticated tasks like vulnerability analysis and exploit generation; 
 
 No practical toolset runs on a typical engineer’s laptop or integrates seamlessly with any popular reverse engineering environment. Interested reverse engineers must switch back and forth between their familiar tool environment and some Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) environment (like PIN) or full system emulator (like QEMU). In this talk, we will present our solution to these limitations. We will explain the Cross-platform Binary Automated Symbolic-execution System (CBASS) that we developed and demonstrate one of its interactive applications: an IDA based Taint-enabled Reverse Engineering Environment (TREE). TREE can deliver program analysis techniques (taint analysis, dynamic slicing, symbolic execution and constraint solving) into the reverse engineer’s hands now. Binary analysis and its security applications have been extensively researched, mainly in the context of a single instruction set architecture (predominantly x86) and popular desktop operating systems (Linux or Windows). CBASS performs its binary analysis on a common Intermediate Representation (IR) rather than on the native Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of any program. This thin layer allows our powerful analysis tools to work on cross-platform binary applications. While CBASS supports both automated and interactive security applications, TREE supports a subset of these capabilities but from with an IDA Pro plug-in. TREE provides useful interactive visualizations of the results of on-demand binary analysis. Symbolic execution and concolic execution (concrete-symbolic execution) are fundamental techniques used in binary analysis; but they are plagued by the exponential path explosion problem. Solving this problem requires vigorous path pruning algorithms and highly parallel computing infrastructure (like clouds). Neither of these is typically available to a reverse engineer. TREE solves this problem by helping the reverse engineer prioritize path execution through an interactive and intuitive visual representation of the results of on-demand analysis of what inputs and instruction sequences led to the crash site or other suspicious path, leverage path constraints and SMT solver to negate tainted branch condition for a new, unexplored path. The details of the taint analysis, dynamic slicing and path constraint solving mechanisms are transparent to reverse engineer. Utilizing the existing IDA Pro debugging infrastructure, TREE can automate trace generation from diversified target platforms, including kernel mode tracing for Windows. To our surprise, despite the fact that IDA Pro debugging API has been around for a long time, there has been no serious effort to automate trace collection for extensible binary analysis, particularly for kernel mode tracing. Our work has directly contributed to two bug fixes in the latest IDA Pro patches (IDA 6.4.130206). Our presentation will feature several case studies of using TREE to analyze real world vulnerabilities. 
 
 Hunting the Shadows: In Depth Analysis of Escalated APT Attacks APT attacks are a new emerging threat and have made headlines in recent years. However, we have yet to see full-scale assessment of targeted attack operations. Taiwan has been a long term target for these cyber-attacks due to its highly developed network infrastructure and sensitive political position. We had a unique chance to monitor, detect, investigate, and mitigate a large number of attacks on government and private sector companies. This presentation will introduce our results of a joint research between Xecure-Lab and Academia Sinica on targeted attack operations across the Taiwan Strait. We have developed a fully automated system, XecScan 2.0 (http://scan.xecure-lab.com) equipped with unique dynamic (sandbox) and static malicious software forensics technology to analyze nature and behavior of malicious binaries and document exploits. The system performs real-time APT classification and associates the analyzed content with existing knowledge base. In our experiments, the XecScan system has analyzed and successfully identified more than 12,000 APT emails, which include APT Malware and Document Exploits. With this presentation we will also analyze and group the samples from the recent Mandiant APT1(61398) Report and will compare the relationships between APT1 samples to the samples discovered in Taiwan and discuss the history behind APT1 Hacker activities. During this presentation we will release a free, publicly accessible portal to our collaborative APT classification platform and access to the XecScan 2.0 APIs. 
 
 I Can Hear You Now: Traffic Interception and Remote Mobile Phone Cloning with a Compromised CDMA Femtocell I have a box on my desk that your CDMA cell phone will automatically connect to while you send and receive phone calls, text messages, emails, and browse the Internet. I own this box. I watch all the traffic that crosses it and you don't even know you're connected to me. Welcome to the New World, where I, not them, own the towers. Oh, and thanks for giving me the box... for free. This box is a femtocell, a low-power cellular base station given or sold to subscribers by mobile network operators. It works just like a small cell tower, using a home Internet connection to interface with the provider network. When in range, a mobile phone will connect to a femtocell as if it were a standard cell tower and send all its traffic through it without any indication to the user. The state-of-the-art authentication protecting cell phone networks can be an imposing target. However, with the rising popularity of femtocells there is more than one way to attack a cellular network. Inside, they run Linux, and they can be hacked. During this talk, we will demonstrate how we've used a femtocell for traffic interception of voice/SMS/data, active network attacks, and explain how we were able to clone a mobile device without physical access. 
 
 Implantable Medical Devices: Hacking Humans In 2006 approximately 350,000 pacemakers and 173,000 ICD's (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators) were implanted in the US alone. 2006 was an important year, as that's when the FDA began approving fully wireless based devices. Today there are well over 3 million pacemakers and over 1.7 million ICD's in use. This talk will focus on the security of wireless implantable medical devices. I will discuss how these devices operate and communicate and the security shortcomings of the current protocols. Our internal research software will be revealed that utilizes a common bedside transmitter to scan for, and interrogate individual medical implants. I will also discuss ideas manufacturers can implement to improve the security of these devices.

 Is that a government in your network or are you just happy to see me? Defense and military network operations center around the age-old game: establishing long-term footholds deep inside a network. In this talk, we will discuss specific techniques and tactics observed while providing defensive incident response services to organizations compromised by foreign intelligence and defense agencies. The discussion will also incorporate the release and open-sourcing of several private projects used to identify pass-the-hash/impersonation attacks, including: a set of network monitoring daemons known as breachbox, part of which was funded by DARPA's Cyber Fast Track program; and an open-source tool and blueprint to help trojanize your own network to monitor and detect adversarial activity.

 Java Every-Days: Exploiting Software Running on 3 Billion Devices Over the last three years, Oracle Java has become the exploit author's best friend, and why not? Java has a rich attack surface, broad install base, and runs on multiple platforms allowing attackers to maximize their return-on-investment. The increased focus on uncovering weaknesses in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) shifted research beyond classic memory corruption issues into abuses of the reflection API that allow for remote code execution. This talk focuses on the vulnerability trends in Java over the last three years and intersects public vulnerability data with Java vulnerabilities submitted to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) program. We begin by reviewing Java's architecture and patch statistics to identify a set of vulnerable Java components. We then highlight the top five vulnerability types seen in ZDI researcher submissions that impact these JRE components and emphasize their recent historical significance. The presentation continues with an in-depth look at specific weaknesses in several Java sub-components, including vulnerability details and examples of how the vulnerabilities manifest and what vulnerability researchers should look for when auditing the component. Finally, we discuss how attackers typically leverage weaknesses in Java. We focus on specific vulnerability types attackers and exploit kits authors are using and what they are doing beyond the vulnerability itself to compromise machines. We conclude with details on the vulnerabilities that were used in this year's Pwn2Own competition and review steps Oracle has taken to address recent issues uncovered in Java. 
 
 Javascript Static Security Analysis made easy with JSPrime Today, more and more developers are switching to JavaScript as their first choice of language. The reason is simple JavaScript has now been started to be accepted as the mainstream programming for applications, be it on the web or on the mobile; be it on client-side, be it on the server side. JavaScript flexibility and its loose typing is friendly to developers to create rich applications at an unbelievable speed. Major advancements in the performance of JavaScript interpreters, in recent days, have almost eliminated the question of scalability and throughput from many organizations. So the point is JavaScript is now a really important and powerful language we have today and it's usage growing everyday. From client-side code in web applications it grew to server-side through Node.JS and it's now supported as proper language to write applications on major mobile operating system platforms like Windows 8 apps and the upcoming Firefox OS apps. But the problem is, many developers practice in-secure coding which leads to many clients side attacks, out of which DOM XSS is the most infamous. We tried to understand the root cause of this problem and figured out is that there are not enough practically usable tools that can solve real-world problems. Hence as our first attempt towards solving this problem, we want to talk about JSPrime: A javascript static analysis tool for the rest of us. It's a very light-weight and very easy to use point-and-click tool! The static analysis tool is based on the very popular Esprima ECMAScript parser by Aria Hidayat. I would like to highlight some of the interesting features of the tool below: JS Library Aware Source & Sinks 
 
 Most dynamic or static analyzers are developed to support native/pure JavaScript which actually is a problem for most developers since the introductions and wide-adoption for JavaScript frameworks/libraries like jQuery, YUI etc. Since these scanners are designed to support pure JavaScript, they fail at understanding the context of the development due to the usage of libraries and produce many false-positives and false-negatives. To solve this we have identified the dangerous user input sources and code execution sink functions for jQuery and YUI, for the initial release and we shall talk about how users can easily extend it for other frameworks.

 Just-In-Time Code Reuse: The more things change, the more they stay the same Fine-grained address space layout randomization (ASLR) has recently been proposed as a method of efficiently mitigating runtime attacks. In this presentation, we introduce the design and implementation of a framework based on a novel attack strategy, dubbed just-in-time code reuse, which both undermines the benefits of fine-grained ASLR and greatly enhances the ease of exploit development on today's platforms that combine standard ASLR and DEP (e.g. Windows 8). Specifically, we derail the assumptions embodied in fine-grained ASLR by exploiting the ability to repeatedly abuse a memory disclosure to map an application's memory layout on-the-fly, dynamically discover API functions and gadgets, and JIT-compile a target program using those gadgets-- all within a script environment at the time an exploit is launched. We demonstrate the power of our framework by using it in conjunction with a real-world exploit against Internet Explorer, show its effectiveness in Windows 8, and also provide extensive evaluations that demonstrate the practicality of just-in-time code reuse attacks. Our findings suggest that fine-grained ASLR may not be as promising as first thought. 
 
 KickaaS Defense with Cloud and Software Defined Security While everyone else is busy spreading uneducated FUD on the supposed insecurity of cloud computing, the reality is cloud computing, and it's foundational technologies, bring tools to the table security pros previously could only dream of. Virtualization, segregation, and isolation are now defaults, not hard-to-achieve end states. Security is decoupled and abstracted from infrastructure, enabling levels of granularity and control nearly impossible with traditional architectures. APIs bind it all together, powering insanely effective security automation and intelligence. This session will present practical techniques to leverage cloud computing and API-driven Software Defined Security to build stronger, more resilient, and more responsive defenses than aren't even close to possible with traditional infrastructure. We'll show what works today, including technical demonstrations, and tell you what to expect once security vendors wake up and really start riding the wave.

 Lawful Access Panel Protecting yourself, your network and your users when the FBI or NSA knocks: When you get a National Security Letter, no one can hear you scream. Being served with a search warrant for a criminal investigation can be scary enough, but national security investigations can be downright Kafkaesque. You probably won't be allowed to tell anyone about it. And they may ask for more than just user data, such as for backdoor access or to install special monitoring hardware or software deep inside your network. This panel will bring together a range of expertise on the perils of secret ""lawful intercepts"" in today's networks. We'll discuss the technical risks of surveillance architectures, the legal and technical defenses against over-broad or invasive searches, and actual experiences fighting against secret surveillance orders. 
 
 Legal Aspects of Full Spectrum Computer Network (Active) Defense Full spectrum computer network (active) defense mean more than simply “hacking back.” We’ve seen a lot of this issue lately. Orin Kerr and Stewart Baker had a lengthy debate about it online. New companies with some high visibility players claim they are providing “active defense” services to their clients. But all-in-all, what does this really mean? And why is it that when you go to your attorneys, they say a flat out, “No.” This presentation examines the entire legal regime surrounding full spectrum computer network (active) defense. It delves into those areas that are easily legal and looks at the controversial issues surrounding others. As such we will discuss technology and sensors (ECPA and the service provider exception); information control and management (DRM); and, “active defense” focusing on – honeypot, beacons, deception (say hello to my little friend the Security and Exchange Commission); open source business intelligence gathering (CFAA, economic espionage; theft of trade secrets); trace back and retrieval of stolen data (CFAA). Past presentations have shown much of what is taken away is audience driven in response to their questions and the subsequent discussion. And, as always, I try to impress upon computer security professionals the importance of working closely with their legal counsel early and often, and of course “Clark’s Law” - explain the technical aspects of computer security to your attorneys at a third grade level so they can understand it and then turn around and explain it to a judge or jury at a first grade level.

 Legal Considerations for Cellular Research The security of mobile communications is becoming increasingly critical, prompting security researchers to focus their attention on vulnerabilities in cellular systems. Researchers need to fully understand the legal ramifications of interacting with specialized hardware, cellular communications, and the restrictions imposed by service providers. This briefing will provide a legal overview of what a researcher should keep in mind when investigating mobile communications, technologies, and networks. We will cover legal issues raised by end user license agreements, jailrooting or rooting devices, and intercepting communications. 
 
 Lessons from Surviving a 300Gbps Denial of Service Attack On Saturday, March 23, 2013, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against Spamhaus that had been growing for weeks culminated with over 300 Gigabits per second of attack traffic targeting the anti-spam organization's network. At that point it became the largest such attack ever reported in history — at least 4x the size of the attacks that crippled US banks just a few months earlier. The attackers launched the full range DDoS methods at Spamhaus — simultaneously targeting Layer 3, Layer 4, and Layer 7. Spamhaus has given us permission to tell the full, behind-the-scenes story of what happened, show how the attacks were launched, outline the techniques the attackers used, and detail how Spamhaus.com was able to stay online throughout. While the Spamhaus story has a happy ending, the massive DDoS exposed key vulnerabilities throughout the Internet that we will need address if the network is to survive the next, inevitably larger, attack.

 Mactans: Injecting Malware into iOS Devices via Malicious Chargers Apple iOS devices are considered by many to be more secure than other mobile offerings. In evaluating this belief, we investigated the extent to which security threats were considered when performing everyday activities such as charging a device. The results were alarming: despite the plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS, we successfully injected arbitrary software into current-generation Apple devices running the latest operating system (OS) software. All users are affected, as our approach requires neither a jailbroken device nor user interaction. In this presentation, we demonstrate how an iOS device can be compromised within one minute of being plugged into a malicious charger. We first examine Apple’s existing security mechanisms to protect against arbitrary software installation, then describe how USB capabilities can be leveraged to bypass these defense mechanisms. To ensure persistence of the resulting infection, we show how an attacker can hide their software in the same way Apple hides its own built-in applications. To demonstrate practical application of these vulnerabilities, we built a proof of concept malicious charger, called Mactans, using a BeagleBoard. This hardware was selected to demonstrate the ease with which innocent-looking, malicious USB chargers can be constructed. While Mactans was built with limited amount of time and a small budget, we also briefly consider what more motivated, well-funded adversaries could accomplish. Finally, we recommend ways in which users can protect themselves and suggest security features Apple could implement to make the attacks we describe substantially more difficult to pull off. 
 
 Mainframes: The Past Will Come Back to Haunt You From governments to military, airlines to banks, the mainframe is alive and well and touches you in everything you do. The security community that's tasked with reviewing the security on mainframes, though, actually knows very little about these beasts. Be it a lack of access by the security community or the false notion that mainframes are dead, there is a distinct gap between the IT security world and the mainframe world. Mainframes in the IT security community are talked about in whispered hushed tones in the back alleys. Neither knowing if they're as secure as IBM (and mainframers) claim or if they're ripe with configuration problems ready to be exploited. This talk will remove some of the mystery surrounding the mainframe, breaking down that 'legacy wall.' Discussing how security is implemented on the mainframe (including where to find configuration files), how to access it, simple networking and configuration commands, file structure etc. will be presented at this session.

 Maltego Tungsten as a collaborative attack platform Maltego has always been a strong favorite for pre-attack intelligence gathering - be that for social engineering, doxing or for infrastructure mapping. Indeed it's earned its rightful place in the Kali Linux top 10 tools. For as long as we can remember we at Paterva were annoyed that Maltego lacked the ability to share intelligence effectively. Up to now the only way to share graphs was to send the actual files around. This is all about to change - with Maltego Tungsten. The Tungsten release (at BlackHat) allows multiple users to share graphs in real time. This creates interesting opportunities and new workflows - suddenly we can have a team of analysts and/or pen testers working together in real time and on the same goal. Be it profiling (or 'doxing') a human target or attacking a network - with real time graph sharing we now have a platform where information can be safely (and anonymously) shared as it happens. The other lacking aspect of Maltego was real bite. In the past we purposely stayed away from all out attack - concentrating rather on info gathering. In this talk we'll also show how to integrate Maltego with industry standard attack tools. This will range from infrastructure attacks, web platform attack and remote Trojans to social engineering as well as denial of service. Combine human intelligence, machines (introduced in Radium release) and real time collaboration with these powerful transforms and wait... oh noes...we've created a monster!! 
 
 Million Browser Botnet Online advertising networks can be a web hacker’s best friend. For mere pennies per thousand impressions (that means browsers) there are service providers who allow you to broadly distribute arbitrary javascript -- even malicious javascript! You are SUPPOSED to use this “feature” to show ads, to track users, and get clicks, but that doesn’t mean you have to abide. Absolutely nothing prevents spending $10, $100, or more to create a massive javascript-driven browser botnet instantly. The real-world power is spooky cool. We know, because we tested it… in-the-wild. With a few lines of HTML5 and javascript code we’ll demonstrate just how you can easily commandeer browsers to perform DDoS attacks, participate in email spam campaigns, crack hashes and even help brute-force passwords. Put simply, instruct browsers to make HTTP requests they didn’t intend, even something as well-known as Cross-Site Request Forgery. With CSRF, no zero-days or malware is required. Oh, and there is no patch. The Web is supposed to work this way. Also nice, when the user leaves the page, our code vanishes. No traces. No tracks. Before leveraging advertising networks, the reason this attack scenario didn’t worry many people is because it has always been difficult to scale up, which is to say, simultaneously control enough browsers (aka botnets) to reach critical mass. Previously, web hackers tried poisoning search engine results, phishing users via email, link spamming Facebook, Twitter and instant messages, Cross-Site Scripting attacks, publishing rigged open proxies, and malicious browser plugins. While all useful methods in certain scenarios, they lack simplicity, invisibility, and most importantly -- scale. That’s what we want! At a moment’s notice, we will show how it is possible to run javascript on an impressively large number of browsers all at once and no one will be the wiser. Today this is possible, and practical. 
 
 Multiplexed Wired Attack Surfaces Manufacturers of mobile devices often multiplex several wired interfaces onto a single connector. Some of these interfaces, probably intended for test and development, are still enabled when the devices ship. We'll show you how you can get a shell on a popular mobile phone via its USB port without using a USB connection and we will release an open source tool for exploring multiplexed wired interfaces. 
 
 OptiROP: hunting for ROP gadgets in style Return-Oriented-Programming (ROP) is the fundamental technique to bypass the widely-used DEP-based exploitation mitigation. Unfortunately, available tools that can help to find ROP gadgets mainly rely on syntactic searching. This method proves to be in inefficient, time-consuming and makes the process of developing ROP-based shellcode pretty frustrated for exploitation writers. This research attempts to solve the problem by introducing a tool named OptiROP that lets exploitation writers search for ROP gadgets with semantic queries. OptiROP supports input binary of all executable formats (PE/ELF/Mach-O) on x86 & x86_64 architectures. Combining sophisticated techniques such as code normalization, code optimization, code slicing, SMT solver, parallel processing and some heuristic searching methods, OptiROP is able to discover desired gadgets very quickly, with much less efforts. Our tool also provides the detail semantic meaning of each gadget found, so users can easily decide how to chain their gadgets for the final shellcode. In case where no suitable gadget is found, OptiROP tries to pick and chain available gadgets to create a sequence of gadgets satisfying the input requirements. This significantly eases the hard job of shellcode writers, so they can focus their time on other tedious parts of the exploitation process. Our talk will entertain the audience with some live demo, so they can see how OptiROP generates gadgets in reality.

 The Outer Limits: Hacking the Samsung Smart TV There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling the transmission. ""Smart"" TVs are becoming more and more common. Samsung and other vendors such as Sony and LG have sold more than a hundred million Smart TVs in the last few years. During this talk, Aaron Grattafiori and Josh Yavor will discuss the Samsung SmartTV design, attack surfaces and overall insecurity of the platform. A short discussion of the current application stack, TV operating system and other details will be provided to help set the stage for details of significant flaws found within the Samsung SmartTV application architecture, APIs and current applications. A number of vulnerabilities will be explored and demonstrated which allow malicious developers or remotely hijacked applications (such as the web browser or social media applications) to take complete control of the TV, steal accounts stored within it and install a userland rootkit. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities also provides the ability for an attacker to use the front-facing video camera or built-in microphone for spying and surveillance as well as facilitate access to local network for continued exploitation. This talk will also discuss methods to bypass what (meager) security protections exist and put forth several worst case scenarios (TV worm anyone?). Concluding this talk, Aaron and Josh will discuss what has been fixed by Samsung and discuss what overall weaknesses should be avoided by future ""Smart"" platforms. Video demos of exploits and userland rootkits will be provided. 
 
 Owning the Routing Table - Part II The holy grail of routing attacks is owning the routing table of a router. In this work we present a powerful OSPF attack that exploit a newly discovered ambiguity of the OSPF protocol -- the most popular routing protocol inside autonomous systems (AS). The attack allows an attacker who gained control over just a single router in an AS to control the routing tables of all other routers in that AS. The attack may be utilized to induce black holes, network cuts or longer routes in order to facilitate DoS of the routing domain or to gain access to information flows which otherwise the attacker had no access to. The attack can also be used to easily DoS a victim router using a single packet. A multi-vendor effort is now under way to fix this vulnerability which currently inflict many of today's OSPF routers. This work is a sequel to the work ""Owning the Routing Table"" we presented at Black Hat USA 2011. This is a joint work with Eitan Menahem, Yuval Elovici and Ariel Waizel of Telekom Innovation Laboratories at Ben Gurion University.

 Pass the Hash and Other Credential Theft and Reuse: Mitigating the risk of Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation Pass the Hash (PtH) has become one of the most widespread attacks affecting our customers and many of our customers have made it their top priority to address these attacks. In response, Microsoft has assembled a workgroup to investigate effective and practical mitigations that could be used now as well as future platform modifications. This presentation will cover the problem of credential theft and re-use, focusing on Pass-the-Hash attacks as an example, and discuss Microsoft’s recommended mitigations. The presenters are members of the workgroup: Patrick Jungles of the Trustworthy Computing group and Mark Simos of the Cybersecurity Services team. 
 
 Pass-The-Hash 2: The Admin's Revenge Some vulnerabilities just can't be patched. Pass-The-Hash attacks against Windows enterprises are still successful and are more popular than ever. Since the PTH-Suite was released at Black Hat last year, Microsoft published their guide for mitigating the attack. Skip and Chris will cover some of the shortcomings in their strategies and offer practical ways to detect and potentially prevent hashes from being passed on your network. Learn how to stop an attacker's lateral movement in your enterprise. 
 
 Pixel Perfect Timing Attacks with HTML5 Maybe you’ve heard it before - HTML 5 and related technologies bring a whole slew of new features to web browsers, some of which can be a threat to security and privacy. But subtle interactions between the less explored corners of new browser features can have some unexpected and dangerous side effects. In this presentation, I’ll introduce a number of new techniques that use JavaScript-based timing attacks to extract sensitive data from your browser. In my talk I will demonstrate cross-browser vulnerabilities against Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox that can be used to access your browsing history and read data from websites you’re logged into. I’ll also take a look at the difficulties involved in fixing these types of vulnerabilities.

 Post Exploitation Operations with Cloud Synchronization Services Cloud backup solutions, such as Dropbox, provide a convenient way for users to synchronize files between user devices. These services are particularly attractive to users, who always want the most current version of critical files on every device. Many of these applications “install” into the user’s profile directory and the synchronization processes are placed in the user’s registry hive (HKCU). Users without administrative privileges can use these applications without so much as popping a UAC dialog. This freedom makes illicit installations of these applications all the more likely. Cloud backup providers are marketing directly to corporate executives offering services that will “increase employee productivity” or “provide virtual teaming opportunities.” Offers such as these make it more likely than ever that any given corporate environment has some cloud backup solutions installed. We released the DropSmack tool at Blackhat EU. This showed enterprise defenders the risks posed by cloud synchronization software and gave pen testers a new toy to play with (you can bet that pen testers weren’t the only ones who noticed). In response to feedback from the original presentation, DropSmack has been improved to deal with some of the unique operational challenges posed by synchronization environments. In particular, we added the ability to work with more synchronization services automatically. In this talk, we’ll demonstrate how DropSmack v2 works and explain how to deploy it in an operational environment. We’ll look at some of the countermeasures to these attacks, including the encryption of synchronized files by third party software. Additionally, we’ll investigate the potential of using so-called “next generation firewalls” to defeat DropSmack. You’ll also learn about the issues of credential storage in the context of cloud synchronization services. Several synchronization applications also use insecure authentication methods. We’ll highlight these applications so you know what works, what doesn’t, and what you should run (not walk) away from. You’ll learn about post-exploitation activities you can accomplish when your freshly compromised target is running a cloud synchronization product. Finally, we’ll demonstrate the steps you need to follow to steal credentials for the products that store them. Why would you want to steal stored credentials for a cloud synchronization service you ask? After all, any files that have been synchronized to the cloud must already on the machine you just compromised, right? Not necessarily. You’ll learn a variety of nasty things you can do with the cloud synchronization service portals that you may never have considered.,/ If you’re a network defender, you’ll leave this talk with a new appreciation of the risks posed by cloud synchronization services (and a nauseous feeling if you have them in your environment). If you are a penetration tester, you’ll leave with a new bag of tricks. Either way, a fun time is sure to be had by all.

 Power Analysis Attacks for Cheapskates Power analysis attacks present a devious method of cracking cryptographic systems. But looking at papers published in this field show that often the equipment used is fairly expensive: the typical oscilloscope used often has at least a 1 GSPS sampling rate, and then various probes and amplifiers also add to this cost. What is a poor researcher to do without such tools? This presentation will give a detailed description of how to setup a power analysis lab for a few hundred dollars, one that provides sufficient performance to attack real devices. It's based on some open-source hardware & software I developed, and is small enough to fit in your pocket. This will be demonstrated live against a microcontroller implementing AES, with details provided so attendees can duplicate the demonstration. This includes an open-hardware design for the capture board, open-source Python tools for doing the capture, and open-source example attacks. Underlying theory behind side-channel attacks will be presented, giving attendees a complete picture of how such attacks work.

 Predicting Susceptibility to Social Bots on Twitter Are some Twitter users more naturally predisposed to interacting with social bots and can social bot creators exploit this knowledge to increase the odds of getting a response? Social bots are growing more intelligent, moving beyond simple reposts of boilerplate ad content to attempt to engage with users and then exploit this trust to promote a product or agenda. While much research has focused on how to identify such bots in the process of spam detection, less research has looked at the other side of the question—detecting users likely to be fooled by bots. This talk provides a summary of research and developments in the social bots arms race before sharing results of our experiment examining user susceptibility. We find that a users’ Klout score, friends count, and followers count are most predictive of whether a user will interact with a bot, and that the Random Forest algorithm produces the best classifier, when used in conjunction with appropriate feature ranking algorithms. With this knowledge, social bot creators could significantly reduce the chance of targeting users who are unlikely to interact. Users displaying higher levels of extraversion were more likely to interact with our social bots. This may have implications for eLearning based awareness training as users higher in extraversion have been shown to perform better when they have great control of the learning environment. Overall, these results show promise for helping understand which users are most vulnerable to social bots. 
 
 Press ROOT to continue: Detecting OSX and Windows bootkits with RDFU UEFI has recently become a very public target for rootkits and malware. Last year at Black Hat 2012, Snare’s insightful talk highlighted the real and very significant potential for developing UEFI rootkits that are very difficult, if not impossible, to detect and/or eradicate. Since then, a couple of practical bootkits have appeared. To combat this new threat, we developed a Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFI (“RDFU”) that incorporates a unified set of tools that address this problem across a wide spectrum of UEFI implementations. We will demonstrate a sample bootkit for Apple OSX that was designed specifically for testing purposes. As a UEFI driver, it infects the OSX kernel utilizing a UEFI “rootkit” technique. The entire infection process executes in memory (by the UEFI driver itself). Therefore, the bootkit does not need to install any OSX kernel extension modules. The bootkit demonstrates the following functionality: Sniffing FileVault passwords (sniffing keys while booting) 
 
 Privilege escalation (to root) 
 
 Hiding PIDs, files, and directories with selected patterns Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFI was developed under DARPA CFT. Following this talk, we will publicly release the RDFU open source code along with whitepapers that outline a possible use case for this technology. 
 
 Revealing Embedded Fingerprints: Deriving intelligence from USB stack interactions Embedded systems are everywhere, from TVs to aircraft, printers to weapons control systems. As a security researcher when you are faced with one of these “black boxes” to test, sometime in-situ, it is difficult to know where to start. However, if there is a USB port on the device there is useful information that can be gained. This talk is about using techniques to analyze USB stack interactions to provide information such as the OS running on the embedded device, the USB drivers installed and devices supported. The talk will also cover some of the more significant challenges faced by researchers attempting to exploit USB vulnerabilities using a Windows 8 USB bug recently discovered by the presenter (MS13-027) as an example.

 RFID Hacking: Live Free or RFID Hard Have you ever attended an RFID hacking presentation and walked away with more questions than answers? This talk will finally provide practical guidance on how RFID proximity badge systems work. We’ll cover what you’ll need to build out your own RFID physical penetration toolkit, and how to easily use an Arduino microcontroller to weaponize commercial RFID badge readers – turning them into custom, long range RFID hacking tools. This presentation will NOT weigh you down with theoretical details, discussions of radio frequencies and modulation schemes, or talk of inductive coupling. It WILL serve as a practical guide for penetration testers to understand the attack tools and techniques available to them for stealing and using RFID proximity badge information to gain unauthorized access to buildings and other secure areas. Schematics and Arduino code will be released, and 100 lucky audience members will receive a custom PCB they can insert into almost any commercial RFID reader to steal badge info and conveniently save it to a text file on a microSD card for later use (such as badge cloning). This solution will allow you to read cards from up to 3 feet away, a significant improvement over the few centimeter range of common RFID hacking tools. Some of the topics we will explore are: Overview of best RFID hacking tools available to get for your toolkit 
 
 Stealing RFID proximity badge info from unsuspecting passers-by 
 
 Replaying RFID badge info and creating fake cloned cards 
 
 Brute-forcing higher privileged badge numbers to gain data center access 
 
 Attacking badge readers and controllers directly 
 
 Planting PwnPlugs, Raspberry Pis, and similar devices as physical backdoors to maintain internal network access 
 
 Creating custom RFID hacking tools using the Arduino 
 
 Defending yourself from RFID hacking threats This DEMO-rich presentation will benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals of the physical penetration testing field.

 Rooting SIM cards SIM cards are among the most widely-deployed computing platforms with over 7 billion cards in active use. Little is known about their security beyond manufacturer claims. Besides SIM cards’ main purpose of identifying subscribers, most of them provide programmable Java runtimes. Based on this flexibility, SIM cards are poised to become an easily extensible trust anchor for otherwise untrusted smartphones, embedded devices, and cars. The protection pretense of SIM cards is based on the understanding that they have never been exploited. This talk ends this myth of unbreakable SIM cards and illustrates that the cards -- like any other computing system -- are plagued by implementation and configuration bugs.

 The SCADA That Didn't Cry Wolf- Who's Really Attacking Your ICS Devices- Part Deux! These attackers had a plan, they acted upon their plan, and they were successful. In my first presentation, given at Black Hat EU in 2013, I covered a robust ICS honeynet that I developed, and who was really attacking them. In this talk, I cover many of the same concepts, but I go several steps further- profiling the attackers that exploited my ICS honeynet. This talk will profile, provide intelligence, and list actors that attacked my ICS honeypot environment. This talk will also feature a demo of the attackers in progress, exfiltrating perceived sensitive data. In addition, I will discuss in greater detail how I geo-located these individuals, and tracked their movements, operations, and attacks. Some of the findings are truly surprising and substantial, and my not be what you think they are. This talk will release brand new statistics and attack details seen nowhere else in the ICS community.

 Smashing The Font Scaler Engine in Windows Kernel The Font Scaler Engine is widely used to scale the outline font definition such as TrueType/OpenType font for a glyph to a specific point size and converts the outline into a bitmap at a particular resolution. The revolution of font in computer that is mainly used for stylist purposes had make many users ignored its security issues. In fact, the Font Scaler engine could cause many security impacts especially in Windows kernel mode. In this talk, the basic structure of the Font Scaler engine will be discussed. This includes the conversion of an outline into a bitmap, the mathematical description of each glyph in an outline font, a set of instruction in each glyph that instruct the Font Scaler Engine to modify the shape of the glyph, and the instruction interpreter etc. Next, we introduce our smart font fuzzing method for identifying the new vulnerabilities of the Font Scaler engine. The different of dumb fuzzing and vulnerable functions will be explained and we will prove that the dumb fuzzing technique is not a good option for Windows Font Fuzzing. Lastly, we focus on the attack vector that could be used to launch the attacks remotely and locally. A demonstration of the new TrueType font vulnerabilities and the attack vector on Windows 8 and Windows 7 will be shown. 
 
 SPY-JACKING THE BOOTERS It's become commonplace for security reporters and providers of security technologies to find themselves targets of hackers' wrath, especially when they put criminal activity under the spotlight. Earlier this year, Brian Krebs had done some work to expose a ""booter"" service. Like other public security figures, he found himself the target of repeated DDoS attacks. In Brian's case, this culminated in a ""SWATting"" attack -- a surprise visit by dozens of heavily armed police at his front door. Research on ""booter"" services reveals a relatively unsophisticated, but high-profit criminal community of DDoS-for-hire web sites that are capable of considerable impact. They operate under legal auspices, leveraging legitimate DDoS protection services. Anyone with an axe to grind and a small amount of money can hire one of these services to have virtually any person or web site knocked off the Internet. As an indicator of how mainstream these services have become, most of them accept payment via Paypal. This talk will delve into the recent proliferation of these malicious commercial DDoS services, and reveal what's been learned about their surreptitious functioning, exposing the proprietors behind these illicit services, and what is known about their targets and their thousands of paying customers. Emphasis will be placed on detailing the vulnerabilities present in most booter sites, and the lessons we can draw about how targets of these attacks can defend themselves. 
 
 SSL, gone in 30 seconds - a BREACH beyond CRIME In this hands-on talk, we will introduce new targeted techniques and research that allows an attacker to reliably retrieve encrypted secrets (session identifiers, CSRF tokens, OAuth tokens, email addresses, ViewState hidden fields, etc.) from an HTTPS channel. We will demonstrate this new browser vector is real and practical by executing a PoC against a major enterprise product in under 30 seconds. We will describe the algorithm behind the attack, how the usage of basic statistical analysis can be applied to extract data from dynamic pages, as well as practical mitigations you can implement today. We will also describe the posture of different SaaS vendors vis-à-vis this attack. Finally, to provide the community with ability to build on our research, determine levels of exposure, and deploy appropriate protection, we will release the BREACH tool. 
 
 Stepping P3wns: Adventures in full-spectrum embedded exploitation (and defense!) Our presentation focuses on two live demonstrations of exploitation and defense of a wide array of ubiquitous networked embedded devices like printers, phones and routers. The first demonstration will feature a proof-of-concept embedded worm capable of stealthy, autonomous polyspecies propagation. This PoC worm will feature at least one* 0-day vulnerability on Cisco IP phones as well as several embedded device vulnerabilities previously disclosed by the authors. We will demonstrate how an attacker can gain stealthy and persistent access to the victim network via multiple remote initial attack vectors against routers and printers. Once inside, we will show how the attacker can use other embedded devices as stepping-stones to compromise significant portions of the victim network without ever needing to compromise the general-purpose computers residing on the network. Our PoC worm is capable of network reconnaissance, manual full-mesh propagation between IP phones, network printers and common networking equipment. Finally, we will demonstrate fully autonomous reconnaissance and exploitation of all embedded devices on the demo network. The second demonstration showcases host-based embedded defense techniques, called Symbiotes, developed by the authors at Columbia University under support from DARPA’s Cyber Fast Track and CRASH programs, as well as IARPA’s STONESOUP and DHS’s S&T Research programs. The Symbiote, is an OS and vendor agnostic host-based defense designed specifically for proprietary embedded systems. We will demonstrate the automated injection of Software Symbiotes into each vulnerable embedded device presented during the first demonstration. We then repeat all attack scenarios presented in the first demo against Symbiote defended devices to demonstrate real-time detection, alerting and mitigation of all malicious embedded implants used by our PoC worm. Lastly, we demonstrate the scalability and integration of Symbiote detection and alerting mechanisms into existing enterprise endpoint protection systems like Symantec End Point. Over the past two years we have discovered vulnerabilities in and and developed exploits for several embedded system. 2011 had not only the version agnostic Cisco IOS rootkit (“Killing the Myth of Cisco IOS Diversity”, Black Hat USA), but also the HP RFU vulnerability (“Print Me if You Dare”, 28C3). In 2012 we presented the Cisco IP phone kernel vulnerability (“Hacking Cisco Phones”, 29C3) . While each exploit focused on one device, we posited polyspecies malware propagation in which a device of one type could be used to exploit a device of a completely different type. In this presentation, we demonstrate an HP printer being used to exploit two different Cisco IP phones (which includes a yet-to-be-disclosed privilege escalation exploit in the 8900/9900 series). We may throw in a fourth yet-to-be-named device just for good measure. We then take the same devices on the same network and install host-based defense to detect or prevent the same exploits. 
 
 Teridian SoC Exploitation: Exploration of harvard architecture smart grid systems The Teridian 8051 based chips are found in a variety of places in daily life, from the smart energy grid to smart cards and pin-pads. While the most prominent placement in the US is currently the metrology and power measurement side of a smart meters, the 8051 core is ubiquitous in embedded devices. They are additionally found in power distribution automation (the backend power shoveling inside your utility) and home automation (monitoring energy usage and changing configuration of appliances and similar in the home). The Teridian System-on-a-Chip platform wraps a complete system around a modified 8051 core, with additional features for chip security to block debug functionality and external access to memory. Additionally, the Harvard architecture design sets relatively rigid barriers between code and data (as opposed to x86/64), which presents an unintentional security barrier, somewhat similar to robust hardware DEP on x86/64 platforms. In this talk, we will quickly cover architecture and system overviews, then dive into exploitation scenarios with techniques to attack Harvard architecture systems and code security implementations. End state results include pathways to gain coveted binary images of firmware and resident code execution. 
 
 TLS 'secrets' SSL and TLS have become the de-facto standards for transport-layer encryption. In recent years, many vulnerabilities have been uncovered in both the standards, their implementation and the way people configure and use them. This talk is exploring in details a lesser-known and much less talked about part of the standard which breaks some of the security properties one would expect. A tool allowing for forensic recovery of plaintext (even when PFS ciphers are in use) will be released.

 Town Hall Meeting: CFAA Reform Strategy Aaron Swartz, a brilliant computer programmer and activist, committed suicide in January. At the time of his passing, Aaron was facing criminal charges carrying the possibility of decades in prison based on his use of the MIT campus network to download millions of journal articles from a database of academic scholarship. Aaron's death has prompted a vigorous public debate about the factors that contributed to his tragedy, including the many problems with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, including its vague language and harsh penalty scheme. The information security community has an important role to play in educating and persuading lawmakers to reform this dangerous law. In this town hall meeting, join activists involved in CFAA reform efforts to discuss how you can get involved in the public debate around CFAA reform and strategize about how to have the most impact.

 UART THOU MAD? Despite the fact that UART has been around FOREVER and is actually frequently used by vulnerability researchers in the hardware space, it has not been discussed as a dedicated topic on its own. This talk is intended to fill that gap. We will provide an overview of what UART is, the tools that exist to work with it and provide examples of why a security researcher should care. We will also explore why UART is a powerful friend for anyone who likes to repurpose hardware. We will also provide BKMs for companies building products that include UART to decrease the likelihood it will be used against them. 
 
 Universal DDoS Mitigation Bypass Today's commercial DDoS mitigation technologies employ many different techniques for identifying DDoS traffics and blocking these threats. Common techniques range from basic malformed traffic check, to traffic profiling and rate limiting, to traffic source verification and so on, with captive redirection utilizing Javascript- or CAPTCHA-based authentications being the most effective by far. However, in our research weaknesses were found in each and every such technique. We rolled all our exploits into a PoC attack tool, giving it near-perfect DDoS mitigation bypass capability against all existing commercial DDoS mitigation solutions. The ramification is huge because for vast majority of web sites, these mitigation solutions stand as their last line of defense, having this last line breached can expose these web sites' backend to devastating damages. We have surveyed extensively the entire range of DDoS mitigation technologies available on the market today, uncovering the countermeasure techniques they employ, how they work and how to defeat each of them. Essentially bypass is achieved through emulating legit traffic characteristics. Afterwards our attack tool is introduced to demonstrate how all these exploits can be brought together to execute a ""combo attack"" to bypass all layers of protection in order to gain access to the backend. To coincide with the publication of this talk, our highly effective _attack_tool_will_be_made_freely_available_. The effectiveness of this tool is illustrated via testing results against specific DDoS mitigation products and popular web sites known to be protected by specific technologies. To conclude our research, a next-gen mitigation technique is also proposed as a countermeasure against our attack methodology. 
 
 USING ONLINE ACTIVITY AS DIGITAL FINGERPRINTS TO CREATE A BETTER SPEAR PHISHER Every day we produce tons of digital breadcrumbs through our activities in online services – from social networks, photo sharing, mailing lists, online forums and blogs to more specialized tools, such as commits to open source projects, music listening services and travel schedules. These have long been known to provide useful information when profiling a target for social engineering purposes, especially due to the frantic pace and often uncensored way at which we generate such content. Our talk takes a tool-oriented approach to these profiling activities. By using data mining techniques combined with natural language processing, we can determine patterns in the way a user interacts with other users, his usual choice of vocabulary and phrasing, the friends/colleagues he most frequently communicates with as well as the topics discussed with them. By consuming publicly available data, using both official APIs and scraping web pages, our profile can be used to validate how close forged content is to actual target-generated data. We will discuss the indexing of unstructured content, including issues such as the legal and technical implications of using official APIs versus scraping, how to build user relationship graphs and how to add temporal references to the collected data. We will also release a tool that automates the data mining and natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured information available on public data sources, as well as comparing user created content against a generated profile using various criteria, including: Network of friends/colleagues; 
 
 Frequency of communication with friends/colleagues; 
 
 Shared interests between target and friends/colleagues; 
 
 Hobbies and personal activities; 
 
 Upcoming and past trips; 
 
 Frequency of use of verbs; 
 
 Frequency of use of adjectives; 
 
 Frequency of use of nouns; 
 
 Average number of words per sentence or paragraph. 
 
 
 
 Virtual Deobfuscator - a DARPA Cyber Fast Track funded effort While there has been a lot research done on automatically reverse engineering of virtualization obfuscators, there has been no approach that did not require a lot of man-hours identifying the bytecode (static approaches) or a complete recreation of the bytecode back to original source form (dynamic approaches). The tool I created, Virtual Deobfuscator, will require no static man-hours reversing for the bytecode location or how the VM interpreter works, and will recreate instructions nearly equivalent to the original instructions.

 What's on the Wire? Physical Layer Tapping with Project Daisho We believe that flaws in network protocols will not be discovered unless physical layer communication tapping solutions are made available to security researchers. In order to have confidence in our communication media we need the ability to monitor and modify the packets transferred on the wire. 802.11 network monitoring allowed the flaws in WEP and WPA to be exposed, Bluetooth Low Energy monitoring has shown problems in the key exchange protocol, but we are often more trusting of wired connections. Project Daisho is an attempt to fix that trust by allowing researchers to investigate wired protocols using existing software tools wherever possible. Daisho is an open source, extensible, modular network tap for wired communication media such as gigabit Ethernet, HDMI connections, and USB 3.0 connections. All aspects of the project are open source, including the hardware designs, software and FPGA cores. The project is producing the first open source USB 3.0 FPGA core. 
 
 What Security Researchers Need to Know About Anti-Hacking Law The federal anti-hacking law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, is infamous for its broad language and tough penalties, and has been used in recent years to bring heavy-handed charges against targets like Andrew Auernheimer (aka Weev) and Aaron Swartz. This presentation will explain why the CFAA is such a dangerous tool in the hands of overzealous prosecutors. I'll survey some of the legal precedents most relevant to the infosec community, including cases on port scanning, violating website terms of use, and designing tools capable of bypassing technical access controls. I'll also explain the prosecution against Weev in depth and discuss its greater implications for security researchers. Finally, I'll discuss what security professionals can learn from these cases to reduce the potential for legal trouble.

 With BIGDATA comes BIG responsibility: Practical exploiting of MDX injections Let’s take a look into the place where critical data is stored for further analytics afterwards. It’s Business Warehouse (BW) and Big Data. Classic online transaction processing systems (OLTP) are not quite suitable to process big data, so they were replaced by OLAP with its multi-dimensional structures. This technology is present in almost all Business Intelligence applications including key vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. All the critical corporate data in one place, well… isn’t it a sweet target for an attacker? The OLAP technology has brought a lot of new terms and concepts into the world: OLAP cube, measures, dimensions, XMLA, and the MDX language, which is used for requests to multi-dimensional data structures. In today’s Business Intelligence (BI) marketplace, most OLAP servers and almost all BI clients talk in MDX. This talk will describe in detail all the entities of this technology and especially the MDX request language. The talk will also feature an overview of possible MDX-related attacks as well as an overview of code injection, data retrieval and update vectors. Moreover, I will show some examples of the systems that can be exploited by MDX-related vulnerabilities, their system-related differences, post-exploitation vectors, and a cheat-sheet with a tool for simplifying MDX Injections. 
 
 ') UNION SELECT `This_Talk` AS ('New Optimization and Obfuscation Techniques’)%00 This talk will present some of the newest and most advanced optimization and obfuscation techniques available in the field of SQL Injections. These techniques can be used to bypass web application firewalls and intrusion detection systems at an alarming speed. This talk will also demonstrate these techniques on both open-source and commercial firewalls and present the ALPHA version of a framework called Leapfrog which Roberto is developing; Leapfrog is designed to assist security professionals, IT administrators, firewall vendors and companies in testing their firewall rules and implementation to determine if they are an adequate enough defense measure to stop a real cyber-attack. Many of the techniques that will be presented were created by Roberto Salgado and are currently some of the fastest methods of extracting information from a database through SQL Injections. Roberto will demonstrate how to reduce the amount of time it takes to exploit a SQL Injection by over a third of the time it would normally take. He will also demonstrate why firewalls and intrusion detection systems are not the ultimate solution to security and why other measurements should also be implemented.

 Workshops 
 
 Do-It-Yourself Cellular IDS For less than $500, you can build your own cellular intrusion detection system to detect malicious activity through your own local femtocell. Our team will show how we leveraged root access on a femtocell, reverse engineered the activation process, and turned it into a proof-of-concept cellular network intrusion monitoring system. We leveraged commercial Home Node-Bs (""femtocells"") to create a 3G cellular network sniffer without needing to reimplement the UMTS or CDMA2000 protocol stacks. Inside a Faraday cage, we connected smartphones to modified femtocells running Linux distributions and redirected traffic to a Snort instance. Then we captured traffic from infected phones and showed how Snort was able to detect and alert upon malicious traffic. We also wrote our own CDMA protocol dissector in order to better analyze CDMA traffic. 
 
 Embedded Devices Security and Firmware Reverse Engineering Embedded devices have become the ""usual presence"" in the network of (m)any household(s), SOHO, enterprise or critical infrastructure. The preached Internet of Things promises to ""gazillion""uple their number and heterogeneity in the next few years. However, embedded devices are becoming lately the ""usual suspects"" in security breaches and security advisories and thus become the ""Achilles' heel"" of one's overall infrastructure security. An important aspect is that embedded devices run on what's commonly known as firmwares. To understand how to secure embedded devices, one needs to understand their firmware and how it works. This workshop aims at presenting a quick-start at how to inspect firmwares and a hands-on presentation with exercises on real firmwares from a security analysis standpoint. 
 
 JTAGulator: Assisted discovery of on-chip debug interfaces On-chip debug (OCD) interfaces can provide chip-level control of a target device and are a primary vector used by hackers to extract program code or data, modify memory contents, or affect device operation on-the-fly. Depending on the complexity of the target device, manually locating available OCD connections can be a difficult and time consuming task, sometimes requiring physical destruction or modification of the device. In this session, Joe will introduce the JTAGulator, an open source hardware tool that assists in identifying OCD connections from test points, vias, or component pads. He will discuss traditional hardware reverse engineering methods and prior art in this field, how OCD interfaces work, and how JTAGulator can simplify the task of discovering such interfaces.

 Methodologies for Hacking Embedded Security Appliances Security appliances, for everything from firewalls to encrypted SAN devices are a dime a dozen these days. Vendors are throwing jargon into everything they possibly can to make the consumer believe they have the top-of-line device, with every possible feature a person could want. Everyone has heard the sales pitches, but does anyone really take the time to verify the claims, or understand how those devices function? We’ll go in-depth on the methods we use in breaking down hardened security appliances for analysis, using real world examples where possible. We hope to point out possible failure points within the construction of a security device, so as to better educate purchasers and producers on why products fail. We’ll analyze methods of key management, cryptographic implementation, system recovery, tamper detection, interfaces, and much more. 
 
 Mo Malware Mo Problems - Cuckoo Sandbox to the rescue Cuckoo Sandbox is a widely used open-source project for automated dynamic malware analysis. It takes malicious documents or URLs as input and provides both high-level overview reports as well as detailed API call traces of the activities observed inside a virtual machine. The project was founded by Claudio Guarnieri and is mainly developed by four developers in their free time and during weekends. Cuckoo Sandbox distinguishes from other solutions thanks to its modular design and flexible customization features. Because of this unique emphasis several large IT corporations and security companies run Cuckoo Sandbox to analyze malware samples on a daily basis and it’s often placed alongside with traditional perimeter security products as an added weapon to incident response and security teams’ arsenals. Being open-source, it also empowers independent and academic security researchers to use a full-fledged malware analysis sandbox freely. For the latest available version we saw more than 8000 downloads and a few hundred constantly running deployments with enabled update-checks. This community also contributes to the project in various forms such as setup instructions, code contributions, behavioral signatures, feature requests and usability feedback and is actively engaged in conversations over mailing lists and IRC. The development team already presented about the project and conducted trainings on several occasions. However due to a wealth of new features and increased development effort, the project is growing and becoming more stable and capable in the recent times. For this reason we want to host a workshop that we designed from scratch with a completely new approach. It will showcase the tool, contain several challenging hands-on exercises with interesting malware samples and explain customization possibilities again with examples that attendees can try. Additionally in this presentation we cover our new VM-introspection based analysis module for the first time. We intend to release it as an alternative to our userland hooking based approach in order to evade malware trying to detect us. So in the future, users can use several analysis methods and compare results to pinpoint evasion techniques. The audience can interact and participate to the workshop with just a web browser and an SSH client.

 PDF Attack: A Journey from the Exploit Kit to the shellcode PDF Attack: A journey from the Exploit Kit to the shellcode is a workshop to show how to analyze obfuscated Javascript code from an Exploit Kit page, extract the exploits used, and analyze them. Nowadays it is possible to use automated tools to extract URLs and binaries but it is also important to know how to do it manually to not to miss a detail. We will focus on PDF documents mostly, starting from a simple Javascript Hello World document and ending with a real file used by a fresh Exploit Kit. This workshop will also include exercises to modify malicious PDF files and obfuscate them to try to bypass AV software; very useful in pentesting. The latest version of peepdf (included in REMnux, BackTrack and Kali Linux) will be used to accomplish these tasks, so this presentation covers the latest tricks used by cybercriminals like using new filters and encryption to make analysis more difficult.

 Practical Pentesting of ERPs and Business Applications Today, the whole business of a company depends on enterprise business applications. They are big systems that store and process all the critical data of companies. Any information an attacker might want, be it a cybercriminal, industrial spy or competitor, is stored here. This information can include financial, customer or public relations, intellectual property, personally identifiable information, and more. Industrial espionage, sabotage and fraud or insider embezzlement may be very effective if targeted at the victim’s business application and cause significant damage to the business. There are many types of those applications: ERPs, CRMs, SRMs, ESBs. Unfortunately, there is still very little information about the security of those systems, especially how to pentest them. During our work on OWASP-EAS subproject, we gathered top 10 critical areas (similar to most of the business applications), so we will present a solid approach for pentesting those types of systems. We will look at 3 different systems from top business application vendors: SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, and show how to pentest them using our cheatsheets that will be released for BlackHat as well as a free tool: ERPScan Pentesting Tool. 
 
 Turbo Talks 
 
 Abusing Web APIs Through Scripted Android Applications This will be a presentation focused on abusing web application APIs through the use of associated Android apps. We'll demonstrate using the JVM based scripting language JRuby to load, modify, and run code from targeted APKs in an easily scriptable way. We'll leverage this to demonstrate attacks against web APIs that have reduced their security requirements in order to allow for a more frictionless mobile experience, such as removing the need for captchas, email validation, and other usage restrictions. Building on that, we'll show code building on the existing testing framework of Burp suite and its Ruby interface Buby to make requests to APIs using the functionality we've exposed through the scripting to find differing responses to similar requests, and identifying potential weak points. We'll conclude with several case studies of popular apps demonstrating private key retrieval, arbitrary unlimited account creation on a social network, and locating and using custom cryptographic routines in our own scripts without the need to understand their implementation.

 Beyond the Application: Cellular Privacy Regulation Space Aggressive data collection practices by cell providers have sparked new FCC interest in closing regulatory gaps in consumer privacy protection. Tensions exist between consumers and carriers, as well as between regulatory agencies. This talk will explore the current landscape from a technical as well as regulatory perspective and examine how it may change in the near future.

 Big Data for Web Application Security The security posture of an application is directly proportional to the amount of information that is known about the application. Although the advantages of analytics from a data science perspective are well known and well documented, the advantages of analytics from a web application security perspective are neither well known nor well documented. How can we, as web application security practitioners, take advantage of big data stacks to improve the security posture of our applications? This talk will dive into the ways that big data analytics can be taken advantage of to create effective defenses for web applications today. We'll outline the fundamental problems that can and should be solved with big data and outline the classes of security mechanisms that simply, based on their nature, cannot be solved with big data. Once an understanding of the domain is established, we'll explore several specific examples that outline how one security team uses big data every day to solve hard, interesting problems and create a safer experience for its users. 
 
 Clickjacking Revisited: A Perceptual View of UI Security We revisit UI security attacks (such as clickjacking) from a perceptual perspective and argue that limitations of human perception make UI security difficult to achieve. We develop five novel attacks that go beyond current UI security defenses. Our attacks are powerful with a 100% success rate in one case. However, they only scratch the surface of possible perceptual attacks on UI security. We discuss possible defenses against our perceptual attacks and find that possible defenses either have an unacceptable usability cost or do not provide a comprehensive defense. Finally, we posit that a number of attacks are possible with a more comprehensive study of human perception.

 CMX: IEEE Clean File Metadata Exchange False positives are a huge problem in the security space. Organizations can spend more time and engineering on reducing FPs than on detecting new malware. Whitelists can help, but there are difficulties with these. Many organizations will not permit the exchange of files for copyright reasons. 3rd party developers must deal with multiple security vendors to get their software whitelisted. CMX is a system being operated by IEEE. 3rd party software developers can submit metadata for their applications to a single portal. Security vendor subscribers can then pull -- in realtime -- all the metadata being pushed into the system. Since only metadata is being exchanged, there are no copyright problems. This system will greatly simplify the maintenance of global whitelists. 
 
 CrowdSource: An Open Source, Crowd Trained Machine Learning Model for Malware Capability Detection Due to the exploding number of unique malware binaries on the Internet and the slow process required for manually analyzing these binaries, security practitioners today have only limited visibility into the functionality implemented by the global population of malware. To date little work has been focused explicitly on quickly and automatically detecting the broad range of high level malware functionality such as the ability of malware to take screenshots, communicate via IRC, or surreptitiously operate users’ webcams. To address this gap, we debut CrowdSource, an open source machine learning based reverse engineering tool. CrowdSource approaches the problem of malware capability identification in a novel way, by training a malware capability detection engine on millions of technical documents from the web. Our intuition for this approach is that malware reverse engineers already rely heavily on the web “crowd” (performing web searches to discover the purpose of obscure function calls and byte strings, for example), so automated approaches, using the tools of machine learning, should also take advantage of this rich and as of yet untapped data source. As a novel malware capability detection approach, CrowdSource does the following: Generates a list of detected software capabilities for novel malware samples (such as the ability of malware to communicate via a particular protocol, perform a given data exfiltration activity, or load a device driver); Provides traceable output for capability detections by including “citations” to the web technical documents that detections are based on; Provides probabilistic malware capability detections when appropriate: e.g., system output may read, “given the following web documents as evidence, it is 80% likely the sample uses IRC as a C2 channel, and 70% likely that it also encrypts this traffic.” CrowdSource is funded under the DARPA Cyber Fast Track initiative, is being developed by the machine learning and malware analysis group at Invincea Labs and is scheduled for beta, open source release to the security community this October. In this presentation we will give complete details on our algorithm for CrowdSource as it stands, including compelling results that demonstrate that CrowdSource can already rapidly reverse engineer a variety of currently active malware variants.

 Denial of Service as a Service - asymmetrical warfare at its finest Imagine being DDOS'd repeatedly with up to 10Gbps of traffic on a daily basis. Your logs are useless (when your systems are even able to collect data). How do you stop the attacks? Crippling Distributed Denial of Service “As a Service” or DDoSaaS (tm) attacks can be done with $200 lifetime memberships against the largest organizations around - and almost impossible to stop. Asymmetrical warfare at its finest. The presentation will focus on an investigation that was done in 2013 regarding a large DDOS attack against a regional ISP in Quebec, Canada. The DDOS attack affected tens of thousand of citizens including municipal 911 services (don't ask) to chicken farmers. We'll talk about the investigative techniques (including social engineering) that were used to track down the suspect and the eventual arrest.

 Denying service to DDOS protection services In this age of cheap and easy DDOS attacks, DDOS protection services promise to go between your server and the Internet to protect you from attackers. Cloud based DDOS protection suffers from several fundamental flaws that will be demonstrated in this talk. This was originally discovered in the process of investigating malicious websites protected by Cloudflare- but the issue also affects a number of other cloud based services including other cloud based anti-DDOS and WAF providers. We have developed a tool – called No Cloud Allowed – that will exploit this new cloud security bypass method and unmask a properly configured DDOS protected website. This talk will also discuss other unmasking methods and provide you with an arsenal to audit your cloud based DDOS or WAF protection.

 Detecting Vulnerabilities in Virtual Devices Using Conformance Testing -- ""Turning Old Hardware into Gold"" Virtual devices are key building blocks of virtual machines. Any flaws or vulnerabilities in a virtual device directly threaten the security of the whole virtual machine. In this talk, we will present our experience detecting bugs in virtual devices by comparing a virtual device to its physical counterpart. Since the device drivers in a guest operating system assume the virtual devices behave the same as the physical devices, any diverging behavior could potentially cause problems for the device drivers and threaten the security of the guest operating system and the virtual machine platform. We compared the QEMU/KVM virtual implementations of the e1000 and eepro100 to their physical counterparts and found multiple bugs in each, one of which was confirmed to affect guest OS security, leading to CVE-2012-6075. Our talk will cover the basic idea of using virtual and physical device comparison for fuzzing virtual devices, and additionally describe the observability of each device type, methods for capturing device events and states, and methods for comparing between them with only partial state information. We will explain each of these steps using the real examples that led to our discovery of bugs in the e1000 and eepro100 virtual devices. We expect this talk to attract a traditional OS security audience as well as people interested in new testing methods for cloud environments. 
 
 Malicious File for Exploiting Forensic Software Commercial forensic software such as EnCase, FTK and X-Ways Forensics adopts the same library component for viewing file content. If the library component is exploitable, lots of forensic investigators are exposed to risks like malware infection and freeze of the software by checking crafted malicious files. This presentation introduces anti-forensic techniques exploiting vulnerabilities of the component embedded in forensic software. Specifically, I show one malicious file can trigger arbitrary code execution on multiple forensic software products. The exploitation has great impact on forensic investigation because most forensic software includes it. The presentation is made up as follows. First, I explain the file viewer component in forensic software and how to fuzz it with a custom script of forensic software, MiniFuzz and a kernel driver for anti-debugging. Next, I describe two vulnerabilities (heap overflow and infinite loop DoS) detected by the fuzzer then demonstrate arbitrary code execution and hang-up of forensic software process using malicious files. I also fill in the gaps on some tricks for exploiting heap overflow (e.g., overwriting function pointers, finding the condition of heap spraying with bitmap images). Finally, I refer to countermeasures. 
 
 Mobile Malware: Why the traditional AV paradigm is doomed and how to use physics to detect undesirable routines The traditional Anti-Virus paradigm focuses on signature-based and behavioral detection. These require substantial processing, which hurts the limited power resources of handsets. Also, carriers are reluctant and slow to deliver Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) patches, due to the rigorous testing they need to subject updates to, and the costs of over-the-air updates. A move to cloud-based screening fails to recognize that not all threats will be propagated over the backbone, may obfuscate themselves in transit; or fight back (as rootkits do) to evade reporting or use of techniques such as the ""Google kill switch"". Hardware vendors are evaluating security solutions with hardware support, such as TrustZone, but while this reduces the vulnerabilities, it still exposes an attack surface. Software-based attestation has been proposed by several research groups, based on various techniques that rely on the physics of the device (such as the speed of the bus, etc) to detect undesirable routines. These techniques typically require some hardware support on the devices, though, such as a trustworthy authentication (of the device to an external verifier) and a timer that cannot be manipulated by malware. 
 
 New Trends in FastFlux Networks Fast-flux networks has been adopted by attackers for many years. Existing works only focus on characteristics such as the fast changing rate of the IP addresses (e.g. A record) and the name server addresses (NS records); the single flux/double flux structure etc. In this work, we track and analyze over 200 fast-flux domains and we discovered that the features of the fast-flux networks have shifted. More specifically, we discovered that the change rate of the IP addresses and name server addresses are slower than before, in some cases even slower than some benign applications that leverage fast-flux alike techniques. We also discovered that IP addresses and name servers are shared among different families of fast-flux domains indicating that there is a well-established under-ground economic model for the use of fast-flux network. Moreover, we also noticed that instead of single or double flux, current fast-flux domains exhibits “n-levels” of flux behavior, i.e., there appears to be “n” levels of name servers in the DNS system for fast-flux domains. Finally, we also studied the benign applications that look alike fast-flux domains but not. In light of these new characteristics, we proposed several new detection approaches that capture the discoveries about the new features of fast-flux domains. 
 
 OPSEC failures of spies The CIA is no more technologically sophisticated than your average American, and as a result, has suffered serious and embarrassing operational failures. This is a rare peek inside the CIA's intelligence gathering operations and the stunning lack of expertise they can bring to the job. In 2005, news organizations around the world reported that an Italian court had signed arrest warrants for 26 Americans in connection with an extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric. At the heart of the case was the stunning lack of OPSEC the team of spies used while they surveilled and then snatched their target off the streets of Milan. The incident, known as the Italian Job inside the CIA, became an international scandal and caused global outrage. What very few people ever understood was that the CIA's top spies were laughably uneducated about cell phone technology and ignorant of the electronic fingerprints left behind. The story would be startling, though old, if not for the fact that eight years after the debacle in Milan, history repeated itself. In 2011, an entire CIA network of Lebanese informants was busted by Hezbollah. The reason: cell phone OPSEC failures. After receiving a warning from Mossad, who had lost their network a year earlier the same way, the CIA dismissed Hezbollah's ability to run analytic software on raw cell phone traffic. But they did. And with a little effort, the CIA's network of spies, as well as their own officers, were identified one by one. This is the true story of American Intelligence's Keystone Kops.

 Password Hashing: the Future is Now Passwords are hashed everywhere: operating systems, smartphones, web services, disk encryption tools, SSH private keys, etc. Hashing passwords mitigates the impact of a compromised database by forcing attackers to bruteforce passwords. Bruteforce is easier when the hash function is not ""salted"", fast to evaluate, and easy to implement as multiple parallel instances on GPUs or multi-core systems. However existing solutions are not satisfactory, and the huge majority of systems rely on weak hashes (eg. leaks from Sony, LinkedIn, or more recently Evernote). After a brief introduction of the problem and previous solution attempts, this talk presents a roadmap towards new improved hashing methods, as desired by a number of parties (from industry and standardization organizations). First, we'll enumerate the technical challenges for software and security engineers as well as cryptographers and attackers, discussion questions like: why, counter-intuitively, parallelism is desirable? How can complexity theory benefit password hashing? How to define a metric that encompasses performance on GPUs and ASICs? Should hashing be performed by the client, server, or both? What about DoS induced by slow hashing? etc. Then we'll describe the initiative that motivated this talk: the Password Hashing Competition (PHC), a project similar to the pure-cryptography competitions AES, eSTREAM, or SHA-3, but focused on the password hashing problem: the PHC gathers the leading experts from the password cracking scene as well as cryptographers and software engineers from academia, industry, as well as NIST, to develop the hashing methods of the future.

 Shattering Illusions in Lock-Free Worlds: Compiler/Hardware Behaviors in OSes and VMs Memory access operations in OSes, VMs or traditional applications from different threads and processes can lead to various security issues depending on the compiler/hardware - especially in non-blocking code. Compilers/hardware pretend to provide sequential order execution, and this illusion does hold for single-threaded code. However, they are not aware of which memory locations are shared and developers oftentimes make the wrong assumptions about memory models. It can be subtle to protect these memory sections from aggressive read/write re-ordering and various optimizations depending on the compiler on x86, x86-64 or the loosely ordered IA64, ARM CPUs as well as GPUs - and it can easily lead to ""losing the illusion"" of sequential consistency. I will discuss common issues depending on the hardware and compiler used, mostly related to loosely ordered hardware and the C/C++11 memory models, but will also compare how they hold in higher level languages. Developers will better understand how these issues can be mitigated and researchers will be able to find them more easily.

 TOR... ALL-THE-THINGS! The global Tor network and its routing protocols provide an excellent framework for online anonymity. However, the selection of Tor-friendly software for Windows currently sucks. Want to anonymously browse the web? You’re stuck with Firefox, and don’t even think about trying to anonymously use Flash. Want to dynamically analyze malware without letting the C2 server know your home IP address? You’re outta luck. Want to anonymously use any program that doesn’t natively support SOCKS or HTTP proxying? Not gonna happen. While some solutions currently exist for generically rerouting traffic through Tor, these solutions either don’t support Windows or require an additional network gateway device. This talk presents a new tool to securely, anonymously, and transparently route all TCP/IP and DNS traffic through Tor, regardless of the client software, and without relying on VPNs or additional hardware or virtual machines. Black Hat 2013 will mark the release of this new Tor tool -- Tortilla!

 Truncating TLS Connections to Violate Beliefs in Web Applications We identify logical web application flaws which can be exploited by TLS truncation attacks to desynchronize the user- and server-perspective of an application's state. It follows immediately that servers may make false assumptions about users, hence, the flaw constitutes a security vulnerability. Moreover, in the context of authentication systems, we exploit the vulnerability to launch the following practical attacks: we exploit the Helios electronic voting system to cast votes on behalf of honest voters, take full control of Microsoft Live accounts, and gain temporary access to Google accounts. 
 
 Untwining Twine Over 14 years ago, Kevin Ashton was the first to coin the term ""internet of things,"" and pointed out that data on the Internet is mostly created by humans. Things have changed considerably since 1999 - Lou Bega's Mambo No. 5 is no longer on the radio, many appliances ship with embedded systems that can be remotely monitored, and the smart home is something we're all excited for and terrified of. Twine is a consumer device that provides remote environmental monitoring through a variety of sensors, such as moisture, temperature, vibration, etc... We will discuss our analysis of Twine, and will lead you through the steps taken to understand what's going on under the hood of a ""black box"" device. The audience will be introduced to the challenges faced, and to the different approaches that can be leveraged to understand (and exploit!) embedded devices (the fridge that tweets and similar devices). Topics include: capturing traffic on a non-proxy aware device, obtaining and reverse engineering the firmware, analyzing opaque binary traffic, emulating a Twine device and gaining console access via the debug serial port. ||||| Security researcher Barnaby Jack on Wednesday showed how easy it can be to trigger a waterfall of cash from a standard bank ATM using readily-available software applications. 
 
 In a presentation at the Black Hat USA 2010 conference in Las Vegas, Jack, director of research at IOActive, a Seattle-based security consulting company, used software to trick two standard ATMs into spitting out wads of cash while displaying ""jackpot"" on the screens. 
 
 According to a Wednesday report from Venturebeat, Jack was able to hack two ATMs built around the Windows CE operating system and either ARM or XScale processors. 
 
 He did so by using a common universal key and a USB stick to load a rootkit software application, along with another program to take over the ATMs. Jack claims to have hacked at least four different ATM machines, a couple of which have since been patched, VentureBeat said. 
 
 Jack also disclosed a couple of easy countermeasures to his hack, including physical locks with unique keys on the ATMs to stop thieves from easily accessing the machines. Vendors should also use a trusted software environment to prevent software hacks, VentureBeat said. 
 
 In Jack's description of his presentation on the Black Hat 2010 Website, he says he was originally scheduled to give his ATM hacking demo last year, but the talk was pulled at the last minute ""due to circumstances beyond my control."" 
 
 Jack also notes that most ATM attacks depend on external devices to skim data from customers' ATM cards, or on physically removing the ATMs to steal the cash, and that attacking the ATM software is rare. 
 
 However, Jack noted that this scenario was featured in one of Hollywood's most famous films. 
 
 ""I've always liked the scene in Terminator 2 where John Connor walks up to an ATM, interfaces his Atari to the card reader and retrieves cash from the machine. I think I've got that kid beat,"" he wrote. ||||| BOSTON Barnaby Jack, a celebrated computer hacker who forced bank ATMs to spit out cash and sparked safety improvements in medical devices, died in San Francisco, a week before he was due to make a high-profile presentation at a hacking conference. 
 
 The New Zealand-born Jack, 35, was found dead on Thursday evening by ""a loved one"" at an apartment in San Francisco's Nob Hill neighborhood, according to a police spokesman. He would not say what caused Jack's death but said police had ruled out foul play. 
 
 The San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said it was conducting an autopsy, although it could be a month before the cause of death is determined. 
 
 Jack was one of the world's most prominent ""white hat"" hackers - those who use their technical skills to find security holes before criminals can exploit them. 
 
 His genius was finding bugs in the tiny computers embedded in equipment, such as medical devices and cash machines. He often received standing ovations at conferences for his creativity and showmanship while his research forced equipment makers to fix bugs in their software. 
 
 Jack had planned to demonstrate his techniques to hack into pacemakers and implanted defibrillators at the Black Hat hackers convention in Las Vegas next Thursday. He told Reuters last week that he could kill a man from 30 feet away by attacking an implanted heart device. 
 
 ""He was passionate about finding security bugs before the bad guys,"" said long-time security industry executive Stuart McClure, who gave Jack one of his first jobs and also had worked with him at Intel Inc's McAfee, the computer security company. 
 
 ""He was one of those people who was put on this earth to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited in a malicious way to hurt people,"" McClure said. 
 
 Jack became one of the world's most famous hackers after a 2010 demonstration of ""Jackpotting"" - getting ATMs to spew out bills. (reut.rs/gIGXVq) A clip of his presentation has been viewed more than 2.6 million times on YouTube. 
 
 Two years ago, Jack turned his attention to medical devices, while working on a team at McAfee that engineered methods for attacking insulin pumps. Their research prompted medical device maker Medtronic Inc to revamp the way it designs its products. (reut.rs/sM9mTE) 
 
 The U.S. government also noticed Jack's work. 
 
 ""The work that Barnaby Jack and others have done to highlight some of these vulnerabilities has contributed importantly to progress in the field,"" said William Maisel, deputy director for science at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
 
 Jack's passion for hacking sometimes got him into trouble. 
 
 In 2012, he connected his laptop to a gold bullion dispensing machine at a casino in Abu Dhabi, according to fellow hacker Tiffany Strauchs Rad. She said Jack had permission from a hotel manager to hack the machine but security intervened. 
 
 It turned out the hotel did not actually own the gold machine and the American Embassy had to be called in to help resolve the misunderstanding, Rad said. 
 
 ""He would hack everything he touched, she said. 
 
 ""BELOVED PIRATE"" 
 
 Jack's most recent employer, the cyber security consulting firm IOActive Inc, said on its Twitter account: ""Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed."" 
 
 Jack had been scheduled to present his research on heart devices at Black Hat on August 1. Last week, Jack told Reuters he had devised a way to hack into a wireless communications system that linked implanted pacemakers and defibrillators with bedside monitors that gather information about their operations. 
 
 ""I'm sure there could be lethal consequences,"" Jack said in a phone interview. 
 
 He declined to name the manufacturer of the device but said he was working with that company to figure out how to prevent malicious attacks on heart patients. 
 
 Jack's sudden death drew responses from the hacking community reminiscent of those that followed the suicide of hacker activist Aaron Swartz in January. 
 
 Dan Kaminsky, a well-known hacker, described the death as a tragedy. ""Barnaby was one of the most creative, energetic, diverse researchers in our field,"" he said. 
 
 ""You'll be missed, bro,"" tweeted another well-known hacker Dino Dai Zovi. 
 
 Jack's sister, Amberleigh Jack, who lives in New Zealand, told Reuters her brother was 35 years old. She declined to comment further, saying she needed time to grieve. 
 
 Black Hat said that it will not replace Jack's session at the conference, saying the hour would be left vacant for conference attendees to commemorate his life and work. 
 
 (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Tiffany Wu, Vicki Allen and Bill Trott) ||||| Well-known hacker Barnaby Jack has died in San Francisco, a week before he was due to show off techniques for attacking implanted heart devices that he said could kill a man from 30 feet away. 
 
 The San Francisco Medical Examiner's office said he died in the city on Thursday. It gave no details. 
 
 Jack, a security expert, became one of the most famous hackers on the planet after a 2010 demonstration in which he forced ATMs to spit out cash, dubbed ""Jackpotting."" 
 
 According to the Black Hat website, Jack was to present Aug. 3-4 on ""Hacking Humans."" 
 
 ""I will discuss how these devices operate and communicate and the security shortcomings of the current protocols. Our internal research software will be revealed that utilizes a common bedside transmitter to scan for, and interrogate individual medical implants,"" according to promotional material for the event. 
 
 The hacking community expressed shock as the news of his death spread via Twitter early on Friday. 
 
 ""Wow ... Speechless,"" Tweeted mobile phone hacker Tyler Shields. 
 
 Jack's most recent employer, the cyber security consulting firm IOActive Inc, said in a Tweet: ""Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed."" 
 
 Jack's genius was finding bugs in the tiny computers that are embedded in equipment such as medical devices and banking machines. He received standing ovations at hacking conventions for his creativity and showmanship. 
 
 ""You grimy bastard. I was just talking up about your awesome work last night,"" Tweeted Dino Dai Zovi, a hacker known for his skill at finding bugs in Apple products. ""You'll be missed, bro."" 
 
 Friends and fans alike Tweeted memorials to Jack's Twitter handle, @barnaby_jack. 
 
 Dan Kaminsky, an expert in Internet security, Tweeted that he had hoped the news of Jack's death was a prank: ""God, the stories. Nobody caused such hilarious trouble like @barnaby_jack."" 
 
 While Jack's attacks on ATMs brought him the most attention, his work on medical devices may have a much broader impact. 
 
 Two years ago, while working at McAfee, he engineered methods for attacking insulin pumps that prompted medical device maker Medtronic Inc to bring in outside security firms and revamp the way it designs its products. 
 
 He followed that up with the work on heart devices that he was due to present at Black Hat next week -- his first presentation at the annual convention since 2010. This year's Black Hat conference starts tomorrow in Las Vegas. 
 
 Jack told Reuters in an interview last week that he had devised a way to attack heart patients by hacking into a wireless communications system that links implanted pacemakers and defibrillators with bedside monitors that gather information about their operations. 
 
 ""I'm sure there could be lethal consequences,"" he said. 
 
 Reuters ||||| Barnaby Jack, a prominent white hat hacker and embedded systems expert with a penchant for pulling off spectacular hacks of devices at conferences globally, has died just days before a scheduled presentation at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. 
 
 Jack most recently was the director of embedded security research at IOActive. He had worked in the security industry for more than a decade, serving in various roles at McAfee, Juniper Networks, eEye digital Security and FoundStone. 
 
 Reached by phone, IOActive's Gunter Ollmann said he was unprepared to speak publicly about the researcher. A message on Twitter from IOActive praised Jack for his research over the last decade.

 ""Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed. He was a master hacker and dear friend. Here's to you Barnes!,"" the IOActive message read. 
 
 Jack was scheduled to give a presentation on the security of wireless implantable medical devices at Black Hat 2013. The demonstration was to show how a bedside transmitter could scan and disrupt the processes of implanted heart devices. Reuters reported that the San Francisco Medical Examiner's office confirmed his death in the city Thursday. It did not elaborate on the cause of death. 
 
 The embedded systems expert took the stage at Black Hat in 2010, providing a stunning performance when he exploited weaknesses in widely used models of ATMs, causing them to spit out money on stage at the hacking conference. He also exposed a bogus ATM machine a year earlier at a Las Vegas hotel hosting the DefCon 17 conference. 
 
 Jack later turned his focus to hacking automobile systems and electronic medical devices, showing how small systems and components that run critical processes can be used by an attacker to cause serious damage or death. 
 
 At Hacker Halted conference in Miami in 2011, Jack showed how he could use a transmitter to interrupt medical insulin pumps. The tiny transmitter had a 300-foot radius and could control just about any embedded medical device, Jack said. 
 
 HD Moore, chief research officer at Rapid7 and chief architect of the Metasploit penetration testing framework, said Jack's work had a significant impact, forcing manufacturers to take action. 
 
 ""He was one of those rare folks who does a great job with research and working with vendors to get weaknesses fixed,"" Moore said. ""He was willing to go all out on his research the way other folks weren't."" 
 
 Joshua Drake, a senior research scientist at Accuvant, said he remembers spending a lot of time with Jack at Black Hat Abu Dhabi in 2010. ""He's a really fun-loving guy and liked to have a good time and a really sweet guy all around,"" Drake said. 
 
 Drake called Jack's research ""noble,"" saying that he chose to go after difficult projects because the outcome could have a major impact on security and safety. Working with embedded systems can be difficult because it's about pulling apart the firmware and digging into closed systems where there isn't much documentation or publicly available source code, Drake said. 
 
 ""He realized that medical devices could be an area where he could help improve the situation because people's lives are at stake,"" Drake said.

96,"In this image from video, taken Nov. 9, 2015, former Vice President Al Gore gestures during an interview with The Associated Press in Nashville, Tenn. After decades of raising alarms about global warming,... (Associated Press) 
 
 NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) — After decades of raising alarms about global warming, former Vice President Al Gore is now raising hopes. 
 
 As a top-level international climate summit starts later this month in Paris, Gore — who helped negotiate the 1997 climate treaty that didn't control the problem — is sure this time will be different. 
 
 ""I'm optimistic,"" Gore said in a sit-down interview this week with The Associated Press. ""We're going to win this. We need to win it faster because a lot of damage is being done day by day. We continue to put 110 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere every 24 hours as if it's an open sewer."" 
 
 In 35 minutes, Gore — portrayed by critics as a preacher of doom and gloom — uses versions of the words ""optimistic"" or ""hopeful"" or ""positive"" at least 16 times. 
 
 Even when he ticks off the alarming impacts of global warming, he finishes with a note of confidence. 
 
 ""The number of extremely hot days has multiplied dramatically,"" Gore said. ""The large downpours, floods, mudslides, the deeper and longer droughts, rising sea levels from the melting ice, forest fires, there's a long list of events that people can see and feel viscerally now. Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. "" 
 
 But he added: ""Increasingly people are connecting those dots. And even if they don't use the phrase climate crisis or global warming, more and more people are feeling that this is going to have to be addressed."" 
 
 On Friday, Gore will take his mixed message of alarm and hope to Paris, a bit ahead of world leaders. He will host a 24-hour-telethon of sorts from the Eiffel Tower to raise awareness about global warming, featuring Elton John, French President Francois Hollande, actor Jared Leto, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, actor Ryan Reynolds and California Gov. Jerry Brown. 
 
 But he said it's no longer just about convincing people to act — it now makes sense economically, too. He says solar and wind energy is dirt cheap — even free in Texas at certain hours. Businesses and developing countries are taking climate change seriously, he said. 
 
 ""There really is a wave in corporate America moving rapidly toward a low carbon economy,"" Gore said. 
 
 Unlike the Kyoto treaty in 1997, which mandated emission cuts for rich nations but not poor, what's likely out of Paris won't require ratification by the U.S. Senate and is based on countries setting their own goals. And that, Gore insisted, is ""more productive."" 
 
 But is Gore, himself? 
 
 Dana Fisher, director of the Program for Society and the Environment at the University of Maryland, said Gore's ""role is limited at this point. There was a moment in time when he was pushing a wave of attention."" But now, she says, she didn't even know that Gore was organizing his Paris telethon. 
 
 ""I never thought of him as central person in the climate movement,"" Fisher said. 
 
 Gore insists that he is. He said he's trained ""many thousands"" of activists and still consults with leaders in the U.S. and other governments at all levels. He plans to be at the Paris climate talks ""until the last dog dies."" 
 
 Some experts suggest Gore's stint as the public face of climate change activism — especially with his 2006 documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" — may have turned off some people because the messenger was so associated with Democratic politics. 
 
 ""Climate change science is demonized because of Al Gore,"" said Erik Conway, a NASA historian who co-wrote the book ""Merchants of Doubt."" Conway doesn't fault Gore, but said, ""If John McCain had become the titular leader of the climate change movement instead of Al Gore, we might have a different world."" 
 
 But Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian who is a co-author of the book with Conway, disagrees. ""He's become demonized because he is effective,"" she said. 
 
 For his part, Gore said, ""Whoever becomes highly visible as a spokesman for change gets the slings and arrows and all of the anger directed at the messenger to try to get at the message."" 
 
 In addition to his Climate Reality Project, his main advocacy group (which is co-producing the telethon), Gore is chairman of Generation Investment Management, a boutique investment managing firm. He is on Apple's board of directors and is a senior partner at a Kleiner Parkins Caufield & Byers, a major Silicon Valley venture capital fund. 
 
 Fifteen years later, the 67-year-old Gore claims he doesn't dwell on 2000 election, when he won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College: ""I started moving forward the day after the Supreme Court decision and I'm excited about the future."" 
 
 So was losing the presidency was all for the best? 
 
 ""No, I wouldn't say that,"" Gore said, laughing. ""I don't think there's any position with as much potential to create positive change as much as president of the U.S., but that was not to be. I feel very fortunate other ways to make a positive difference."" 
 
 Then he returned to the subject of his telethon. Hozier will be among the performers; Gore whips out his iPhone to play the singer's 2014 hit, ""Take Me To Church."" 
 
 He closed his eyes and listened. The song's final verse: ""In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene, only then I am human, only then I am clean.""

 Pharrell Williams and Al Gore’s promise of a second round of Live Earth concerts on seven continents that would be broadcast to an audience of billions has been downgraded to a webcast in Paris, organisers have confirmed. 
 
 Everything you need to know about the Paris climate summit and UN talks Read more 
 
 In January, the duo and producer Kevin Wall used the World Economic Forum in Davos to announce a global event that would reach 2 billion people across 193 television networks, with promotional materials promising 100 artists in seven shows. 
 
 In May organisers delayed the event from a scheduled date of 18 June and said a free, public concert would be held in Paris in the autumn instead. 
 
 But this week organisers told the Guardian that Live Earth had been reduced to an event on the 13 and 14 November at the Champ de Mars in Paris that will be closed to the public and streamed online instead. 
 
 “It is taking a different form this year than the open concert of years past but some great musical talent has signed on to the 24 Hours event,” said a spokeswoman, referring to an annual 24-hour event held by Gore’s NGO, Climate Reality. She added: “We are partnering with several distribution partners worldwide to make sure this is the most accessible 24 Hours event in history.”

 Details of the webcast distribution and the acts performing are due to be announced on Thursday. 
 
 Williams, the project’s creative director, had said in January that: “Instead of just having people perform, we literally are going to have humanity harmonise all at once.” He was one of the performers in the original Live Earth concerts in 2007. 
 
 Next week’s event, dubbed 24 Hours of Reality and Live Earth: The World Is Watching, comes just weeks before world leaders including Barack Obama and Xi Jinping head to Paris for a landmark UN climate change summit. 
 
 Gore said the event is “about mobilising people around the world to help solve the climate crisis and making our voices heard in national capitals and at the negotiating table in Paris.”

 French president, François Hollande, and the Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, will be taking part in the web event, along with former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, journalists, weather presenters, and campaigners. 
 
 Wall said of the new plans: “The climate crisis is grave, so we are harnessing the best content and the latest in mobile, social media, and online distribution to make sure we can connect with people everywhere.” ||||| As UN climate negotiations resume in Bonn, we look at why the crunch Paris climate conference from 30 November to 11 December is so important 
 
 What is happening in Paris this December? 
 
 The governments of more than 190 nations will gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and thus avoiding the threat of dangerous climate change. 
 
 Why now? 
 
 Current commitments on greenhouse gas emissions run out in 2020, so at Paris governments are expected to produce an agreement on what happens for the decade after that at least, and potentially beyond. 
 
 Emissions trajectory Photograph: Guardian 
 
 Why is this important? 
 
 Scientists have warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, we will pass the threshold beyond which global warming becomes catastrophic and irreversible. That threshold is estimated as a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, and on current emissions trajectories we are heading for a rise of about 5C. That may not sound like much, but the temperature difference between today’s world and the last ice age was about 5C, so seemingly small changes in temperature can mean big differences for the Earth. 
 
 Why has nobody thought of getting a global agreement on this before now? 
 
 They have: global negotiations on climate change have been carrying on for more than 20 years. The history of climate change goes back much further: in the 19th century, physicists theorised about the role of greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere, and several suggested that the warming effect would increase alongside the levels of these gases in the atmosphere. But this was all theoretical. 
 
 Only in the past few decades have scientists begun the measurements necessary to establish a relationship between current carbon levels and temperatures, and the science conducted since then has consistently pointed in one direction: that rising greenhouse gas emissions, arising from our use of fossil fuels and our industries, lead to higher temperatures. 
 
 The hottest year ever around the world – in pictures Read more 
 
 Hasn’t global warming stopped? 
 
 No. Global temperatures have been on a clear upward path. There was a spike in 1998, after which temperatures were lower – but still warmer than previous decades – that led some climate sceptics to claim that the world was cooling. 
 
 During the period since 1998, global temperatures have risen at a slower pace than they did in the previous 30 years. That, too, has been seized upon by sceptics as evidence that global warming has “paused”. 
 
 But it is important to note that temperatures have not fallen, or stalled – they have continued to rise. Given the variations that characterise our weather systems, a period in which the rate of warming slowed is not unexpected. 
 
 For the past two years, the rate of warming seems to have accelerated again, but little can be construed from that. 
 
 What progress have we seen on a global agreement? 
 
 In 1992, governments met in Rio de Janeiro and forged the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That agreement, still in force, bound governments to take action to avoid dangerous climate change, but did not specify what actions. Over the following five years, governments wrangled over what each should do, and what should be the role of developed countries versus poorer nations. 
 
 Those years of argument produced, in 1997, the Kyoto protocol. That pact required worldwide cuts in emissions of about 5%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2012, and each developed country was allotted a target on emissions reductions. But developing countries, including China, South Korea, Mexico and other rapidly emerging economies, were given no targets and allowed to increase their emissions at will.

 Al Gore, then US vice-president, signed up to the protocol, but it was quickly apparent that it would never be ratified by the US Congress. Legally, the protocol could not come into force until countries representing 55% of global emissions had ratified it. With the US – then the world’s biggest emitter – on the outside, that was not going to happen. 
 
 
 
 So for most of the following decade, the Kyoto protocol remained in abeyance and global climate change negotiations ground to a near-halt. But in late 2004, Russia decided to pass the treaty – unexpectedly, and as part of a move to have its application for World Trade Organisation membership accepted by the European Union. That made up the weight needed, and the protocol finally came into force. 
 
 So we had a global agreement? 
 
 Not quite. The US, under George W Bush, remained firmly outside Kyoto, so although the UN negotiations carried on year after year, the US negotiators were often in different rooms from the rest of the world. It was clear a new approach was needed that could bring the US in, and encourage the major developing economies – especially China, now the world’s biggest emitter – to take on limits to their emissions. 
 
 What followed was, agreed at Bali in 2007 after much drama, an action plan that set the world on the course to a new agreement that would take over from Kyoto. 
 
 This is taking a long time. What happened next? 
 
 It did take a long time. But getting agreement from 196 countries was never going to be easy. The next act of this long-running drama fully demonstrated that: the Copenhagen conference of 2009.

 What happened at Copenhagen? 
 
 Everything but the treaty. All of the world’s developed countries and the biggest developing countries agreed – for the first time – to limits on their greenhouse gas emissions. This was a landmark, as it meant the world’s biggest emitters were united towards a single goal. 
 
 The emissions reductions agreed on were still not enough to meet scientific advice, but they were a big advance on reducing emissions compared with “business as usual”. 
 
 But what didn’t happen turned out to be the point that NGOs and many in the press seized on. What didn’t happen was a fully articulated and legally binding treaty. 
 
 Is that important? 
 
 It depends on your viewpoint. The Kyoto protocol was a beautifully written, watertight, fully legally binding international treaty, a sub-treaty of the similarly binding UNFCCC. But it never met its objectives, because it wasn’t ratified by the US, and not by Russia until it was too late. And none of the countries that failed to meet their commitments under Kyoto have been sanctioned. 
 
 The Copenhagen agreement, on the other hand, was not fully adopted by the UN in 2009 because of last-minute chaos at the conference, though it was ratified the following year in the form of the Cancun agreements. For this reason, the Copenhagen agreement was derided as a failure by green groups. 
 
 But the targets agreed at Copenhagen, in the form of a document signed by world leaders, still stand.

 What is likely to be agreed in Paris? 
 
 We know already what the biggest emitters have committed to. The EU will cut its emissions by 40%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2030. The US will cut its emissions by 26% to 28%, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. China will agree that its emissions will peak by 2030. 
 
 Nations responsible for more than 90% of global emissions have now come up with their targets – known in the UN jargon as Indended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs . These include all of the major developed and developing countries, though their contributions vary: in the case of developed countries, actual cuts in emissions, but for developing countries a range of targets including limits on emissions compared to “business as usual”, and pledges to increase low-carbon energy or preserve forests. 
 
 Analysis of the INDCS, endorsed by the UN, has suggested that these pledges are enough to hold the world to about 2.7C or 3C of warming. That is not quite enough to meet the scientific advice. However, that is not the end of the story. One of the key components of any Paris agreement would be to institute a system of review of the emissions targets every five years, with a view to ratcheting them upwards. 
 
 Another, and complementary, approach is to make more effort to bring down emissions outside the UN process, for instance by engaging “non-state actors” such as cities, local governments and businesses to do more. 
 
 If the commitments from the major countries are in the bag, does that mean the Paris agreement is settled? 
 
 Not at all – the other key question, apart from emissions reductions, is finance. Poorer countries want the rich world to provide them with financial help that will enable them to invest in clean technology to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, and to adapt their infrastructure to the likely damage from climate change. 
 
 This is a hugely contentious issue. At Copenhagen, where the finance part of the deal was only sorted out at the very last minute, rich countries agreed to supply $30bn ($20bn) of “fast-start” financial assistance to the poor nations, and they said that by 2020, financial flows of at least $100bn a year would be provided. 
 
 As a cornerstone of any Paris agreement, poor countries want assurances that this pledge will be met. That has now been given, in several forms: the OECD issued a report in October showing that two thirds of the finance required is already being supplied; and a report by the World Resources Institute showed that the remainder can be made up by increased finance from the World Bank and other development banks, and from the private sector. The World Bank and several governments have already committed to upping their financial assistance, meaning that a clear path towards the 2020 target can now be discerned. 
 
 There is more, however. Poor nations also want a similar provision in place beyond 2020, but there is strong disagreement over how this should be done. Some want all the money to come from rich country governments, but those governments are adamant that they will not provide such funding solely from the public purse. They want international development banks, such as the World Bank, to play a role, and they want most of the funding to come from the private sector. 
 
 An agreement on this is still possible, but it will be one of the main obstacles to a Paris deal. 
 
 Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure Read more 
 
 Will world leaders go to Paris to agree on this? 
 
 Yes. The heads of state or government of more than 130 countries have already said they will come. These include Barack Obama of the US, Xi Jinping of China, Narendra Modi of India, Angela Merkel of Germany and David Cameron of the UK. None have as yet pulled out as a result of the terrorist attacks on Paris, and security has been stepped up as an assurance. Unlike the Copenhagen talks, however, at which world leaders turned up at the last minute of the two weeks of talks to find their negotiating teams in chaos and without a clear agreement for them to sign, this time the leaders will arrive at the beginning of the conference, give their negotiating teams clear instructions, and expect a fully formed agreement at the end of it. 
 
 On behalf of the French government, the conference will be led by foreign minister Laurent Fabius, and environment minister Segolene Royal, but the French president Francois Hollande will also play a key role. They are all confident that a deal can be made.

 What else can we expect before Paris? 
 
 The key question now is over security. With the French capital under recent attack, and reports of fresh assaults averted by the armed forces, the atmosphere in Paris will be unlike any city that has hosted major international talks before. Security will be paramount - the French police and army will be on the streets, and the venue will be patrolled by uniformed UN guards - but the atrocities of 13 November will hang heavily on all delegates. This may mean that when world leaders attend private meetings, terrorism is discussed before climate change. But it may also mean that delegates are under more pressure than ever to come up with a deal, given the tragic circumstances surrounding them. 
 
 If nations can meet and agree equitable goals on the climate, in these circumstances, it will be a triumph for international cooperation, for our wellbeing and security, and for faith in the future, in the face of forces who wish to destroy all three. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

97,"Forces loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi pressed their offensive into eastern Libya on Sunday, as an unraveling and demoralized rebel force fled the coastal oil town of Brega and began to lose its grip on power in its de facto capital city of Benghazi. 
 
 The battlefield developments lent urgency to an Arab League request Saturday to the United Nations Security Council to enforce a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace that is likely to be taken up this week. 
 
 The League's decision was an unprecedented endorsement of military action aimed at an Arab country, but European diplomats said it wouldn't likely suffice to ensure the measure is enacted. 
 
 The opposition's armed ragtag volunteer corps continued to lose ground. Rebel officials on Sunday said they have begun rounding up Gadhafi supporters in Benghazi following a string of mysterious explosions, armed robberies and the assassination on Saturday night of a journalist from al-Jazeera, the Arab satellite channel. 
 
 In a sign of spreading panic, several international humanitarian groups and news organizations pulled their staff from Benghazi to the city of Tobruq near the Egyptian border, citing concerns that, after taking Brega, government forces might head straight to the frontier. If Mr. Gadhafi's troops succeeded in capturing Tobruq, they would cut off rebels' supply lines from Egypt and any hopes of an unimpeded retreat. 
 
 ""There was a lot of speculation: will he try to seal everybody in?"" said Cassandra Nelson of Mercy Corps, one of the aid groups that retreated to Tobruq. 
 
 In Tripoli, the spokesman for the Libyan armed forces made a rare appearance, telling foreign journalists the government's forces have routed rebels from areas as far east as the coastal town of Brega. ""The areas have been cleansed,"" the spokesman, Col. Milad Hussein, said. 
 
 Col. Hussein said the government had full control of the town of Zawiya, about 30 miles west of Tripoli and the strategic eastern oil-facilities towns of Ras Lanuf and Brega. 
 
 Speaking in Benghazi on Sunday, Abdel Fattah Younis, the former Minister of Interior who defected early in the uprising to the rebels' side and is now the rebel military's chief of staff, countered that rebel defeats at Ras Lanuf and Brega were merely tactical withdrawals. 
 
 ""Even if our forces have withdrawn a few kilometers, that doesn't mean much in military terms, especially if they are fighting in a semi-desert with little strategic value,"" he said. 
 
 Rebel forces are hoping to make a stand against Col. Gadhafi in more built up areas where the government's air and artillery advantage would matter less. In recent weeks the rebels have put up tough fights in urban areas of western Libya, but have proven less effective fighting in open terrain, where they are exposed to airstrikes. 
 
 European diplomats said the Arab League decision would turn the international focus back to U.N. deliberations this week. But they said the weight of the message would be softened somewhat by the fact that Libya's neighbors, Algeria and Syria, didn't back the no-fly zone. 
 
 Also tempering momentum is the reluctance of most, if not all, Arab countries to go beyond rhetorical, and perhaps some financial, support for United Nation's enforced no-fly zone. 
 
 Despite favoring the recommendation that the Security Council enforce a no-fly zone, the Egyptian military, the Arab world's largest, is unlikely to participate in such an operation or to offer strategic support, said analysts. 
 
 After assuming power in the wake of President Hosni Mubarak's departure, the armed forces are now more focused on internal affairs of state and will want to avoid the popular stigma of colluding with Western powers to attack a fellow Arab country, observers say. 
 
 ""I don't think that the Egyptian armed forces have time now to engage in such outside problems. They are very busy here in Egypt,"" said Mohammed Kadry Said, a retired major general in Egypt's Air Defense Command and the head of security studies at the government-funded Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. 
 
 When European Union leaders met Friday to discuss Libya, many, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, showed reluctance to support no-fly-zone proposals being pushed particularly by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
 
 They agreed to such action only if there was a demonstrable need, a clear legal basis for it and regional Arab support. 
 
 At the Security Council, China is still seen as the big stumbling block; its reluctance to give a stamp of approval to any international intervention in a developing nation remains strong. Any move will be further complicated by the fact that China this month holds the rotating seat of Security Council president.

 From Tripoli, NPR's David Greene spoke to Robert Siegel for this afternoon's All Things Considered. David said he found something rather surprising on the streets of the Libyan capital: a celebration. 
 
 David spoke to one man, who was a Gadhafi supporter. Here's a bit of audio from their exchange; note that we'll add David's whole piece later: 
 
 David Greene From Tripoli 
 
 David said his movements have been heavily controlled by the government. In fact, he says, on two occasions, Libyan officials showed him Libyan state news and emphasized that the uprising was being led by Al-Qaida. David says that every once in a while he'll hear a PA announcement at his hotel calling on all journalists to get on the bus, because there's a story they want them to cover. 
 
 David told Robert that it's been hard to get a real handle on what the mood is really like in the capital city. 
 
 Elsewhere in Libya, however, the violence has continued. The New York Times reports that Pro-Gadhafi forces launched fresh air attacks on Benghazi, which has become a home base for rebels. The government also offered amnesty to rebels who gave up their weapons. 
 
 The paper talks to a resident of Zawarah, which has been overtaken by the Gadhafi regime: 
 
 ""We know what happened in Zawiyah, and we think that the same thing is going to happen here soon,"" one resident said, speaking anonymously to protect himself and his family from retribution. ""They say that if you take down the flag, we will let you live,"" he added. ""Maybe we will fight, but we will have a lot of casualties."" 
 
 All of this is happening as the international community weighs its options. British Prime Minister David Cameron issued his strongest statements yet. Speaking to the British House of Commons, this afternoon, he said he wanted Britain to be involved in military action in Libya. 
 
 The Guardian reports: 
 
 He said that setting up a no-fly zone was ""perfectly practical and deliverable"" and that action would have to take place soon. ""Time could be relatively short,"" he said. ""To those who say it is nothing to do with us, I would simply respond: Do we want a situation where a failed pariah state festers on Europe's southern border, potentially threatening our security, pushing people across the Mediterranean and creating a more dangerous and uncertain world for Britain and for all our allies as well as for the people of Libya?"" 
 
 The United Nations Security Council met today about establishing a no-fly zone over Libya, but nothing was decided. Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin expressed strong reservations. The AFP reports: 
 
 As far as we are concerned there are some fundamental questions that need to be answered,"" Churkin told reporters as he left the Security Council talks. ""If there is a no-fly zone, who is going to implement the no-fly zone? How the no-fly zone is going to be implemented?"" he asked. ""We have not had enough information. To say 'we need to act quickly,' 'as fast as possible' but not to provide the fundamental answers to those fundamental questions, to us is not really helping. It is just beating the air."" 
 
 The French ambassador said the no-fly zone was still on the table and a decision could come later this week. 
 
 Update at 6:08 p.m. ET: As Korva reported earlier, the Group of Eight leading economies was also meeting in Paris tonight. 
 
 Quoting Italy's foreign minister, the AP reports that the group came to no agreement about a no-fly zone over Libya. Franco Frattini told reporters that France and Britain favor a no-fly zone but Russia and Germany are ""reluctant to approve"" one. 
 
 Secretary of State Hilary Clinton was also there for the two-day meeting. 
 
 Update at 7:26 p.m. ET: NPR's David Welna reports that the Senate passed a non-binding resolution calling for the U.S. to recognize the provisional revolutionary government in Eastern Libya and establishing a no-fly zone over the country. 
 
 The Hill reports that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the resolution's sponsors, gave an impassioned speech in favor of it:","– It was a bad day for rebel forces in Libya, but in the streets of Tripoli people were celebrating—in part because they believed the news state-run television was broadcasting. David Green of NPR talked to people in a crowd of a few hundred Moammar Gadhafi supporters, who said they believed that al-Qaeda was responsible for the uprising, a message the state-run media has been heavily propagating. The regime also used state television to attempt to undermine rebel morale today, as ministers announced that they’d give amnesty to anyone who gave up their weapons, the New York Times reports. At the same time, loyalist forces gained ground militarily, pushing rebels out of the coastal oil town of Brega, according to the Wall Street Journal. There were also a series of mysterious explosions in Benghazi, along with some robberies and the murder of an al-Jazeera journalist, prompting rebel authorities to round up Gadhafi supporters.","<pad> Libyan forces in the early hours of Sunday, said the government had rerouted rebels from areas as far east as Brega.</s>",0.10687022631548283,0.02312138506331673,0.07633587517044471
98,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is pushing back against a report that she told colleagues she was close to resigning Wednesday after President Donald Trump scolded her at a cabinet meeting. 
 
 Nielsen says in a statement that Trump ""is rightly frustrated"" that his administration has been prevented ""from fully securing the border and protecting the American people."" 
 
 She says she shares Trump's frustration. 
 
 The New York Times reported Thursday that the president has growing increasingly angry with Nielsen over what he feels is the country's inability to adequately secure its border. 
 
 The Times reported that Nielsen had drafted a resignation letter but not submitted it. 
 
 Homeland Security spokesman Tyler Houlton says on Twitter that the report is not accurate and Nielsen was not close to resigning. ||||| One person familiar with Mr. Trump’s blowup at the meeting said it was prompted by a discussion about why Mexico was not doing more to prevent illegal border crossings into the United States. Another person said the president was primarily focused on the Homeland Security Department because he viewed Ms. Nielsen as primarily responsible for keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. 
 
 During the meeting, Mr. Trump yelled about the United States’ porous border and said more needed to be done to fix it. When members of his cabinet pointed out that the country relies on day laborers who cross the border each day, Mr. Trump said that was fine, but continued to complain, one person said. 
 
 The president also complained about the continued failure of his administration to find a way to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, two people familiar with the episode said. 
 
 Ms. Nielsen viewed the president’s rant as directed mostly at her, and she told associates after the meeting that she should not continue in the job if he did not view her as effective. One person close to Ms. Nielsen said she was miserable in her job. 
 
 Mr. Trump has clashed with Ms. Nielsen for weeks about his belief that more should be done to secure the border. In early April, the president repeatedly expressed frustration with Ms. Nielsen that her department was not doing enough to close loopholes that were allowing illegal immigrants into the country, according to one official familiar with those discussions. 
 
 During those discussions, officials had presented Mr. Trump with a list of proposals that would help border agents crack down on those trying to cross the border illegally and send them back more quickly. The president urged Ms. Nielsen to be more aggressive, the official said. 
 
 One persistent issue has been Mr. Trump’s belief that Ms. Nielsen and other officials in the department were resisting his direction that parents be separated from their children when families cross illegally into the United States, several officials said. The president and his aides in the White House had been pushing a family separation policy for weeks as a way of deterring families from trying to cross the border illegally. ||||| The @ nytimes article alleging that the Secretary drafted a resignation letter yesterday and was close to resigning is false.

 If the ""Scan & Go"" test by the world's largest retailer is successful, it has the potential to change the way people shop and pay, making the process more personal and potentially faster. 
 
 Earlier this week, Walmart invited employees with Apple Inc iPhones to participate in a test at a Walmart supercenter in Rogers, Arkansas, near the company's headquarters, according to a form on the Survey Monkey website. (here) 
 
 ""All of the effort is to speed your way through the checkout so that we can reduce costs and improve the shopping experience,"" said Paul Weitzel, managing partner at retail consulting firm Willard Bishop, who said he had not seen Walmart's test. ""With smartphones and improved technology we're only going to see more of this."" 
 
 The test comes months after Walmart said that it would add more self-checkout lanes at its Walmart and Sam's Club stores as it continues to look for ways to lower costs and prices for its shoppers. 
 
 Pushing more shoppers to scan their own items and make payments without the help of a cashier could save Walmart millions of dollars, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on March 7. The company spends about $12 million in cashier wages every second at its Walmart U.S. stores. 
 
 Shoppers often complain on Twitter and in other forums that it takes too long to pay at Walmart, where sometimes only a few of the several checkout lanes are open and staffed with cashiers. While some retailers employ baggers to speed up the checkout process, at Walmart one employee scans and bags items. 
 
 ""We're continually testing new and innovative ways to serve customers and enhance the shopping experience in our stores,"" said Walmart spokesman David Tovar. 
 
 Walmart's iPhone app already includes functions such as letting shoppers create lists and seeing which items are in stock. 
 
 The test comes as retailers and restaurants are trying to figure out ways to speed up the checkout process by letting customers pay with a tap of their smartphones. 
 
 In the Walmart iPhone scanning test, shoppers can scan products with their phone and put them in bags while they shop, and then pay at a self-checkout counter. 
 
 The test does not allow users to pay on their phone. The app transfers the scanned items to the self-checkout kiosk and then shoppers complete the transaction using the normal self-checkout process. 
 
 Walmart declined to give details on where the test might lead, but it could conceivably allow for scanning on other smart phones and be paired with mobile payment. 
 
 Walmart earlier this month said it was joining with other retailers to develop a mobile payment network, a retailer-led initiative that would match similar services by Google Inc and eBay Inc, among others. 
 
 While self-checkout aisles are common at many stores, the ability to scan items with one's mobile phone while shopping is not a typical process. Among other tests, Supervalu Inc's Jewel-Osco chain once let shoppers use handheld scanners and then enter that information at the checkout to pay, but that test ended years ago. 
 
 ""This is probably the fourth technology that we've tried between shopping carts, RFID chips, the handheld scanners and now we've got smartphones,"" Weitzel said of the retail industry. ""We're looking for ways to improve that experience as an industry."" 
 
 Walmart's test appears to be limited to one store, but it appears that the company sought out participants beyond its staff for its study. The company asked employees to reach out to friends and family in its search for participants, according to a copy of an email sent by the company's @WalmartLabs team and obtained by Reuters. A company spokesman would not verify this on Friday afternoon. 
 
 Walmart offered participants in one-hour sessions $100 for their time and a $25 gift card to use in the store for purchases, according to the form on the Survey Monkey website. 
 
 Walmart shares closed up 35 cents at $72.60 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

100,"Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is preparing plans to shore up German banks in the event that Greece fails to meet the terms of its aid package and defaults, three coalition officials said. 
 
 The emergency plan involves measures to help banks and insurers that face a possible 50 percent loss on their Greek bonds if the next tranche of Greece’s bailout is withheld, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are being held in private. The successor to the German government’s bank-rescue fund introduced in 2008 might be enrolled to help recapitalize the banks, one of the people said. 
 
 The existence of a “Plan B” underscores German concerns that Greece’s failure to stick to budget-cutting targets threatens European efforts to tame the debt crisis rattling the euro. German lawmakers stepped up their criticism of Greece this week, threatening to withhold aid unless it meets the terms of its austerity package, after an international mission to Athens suspended its report on the country’s progress. 
 
 Greece is “on a knife’s edge,” German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers at a closed-door meeting in Berlin on Sept. 7, a report in parliament’s bulletin showed yesterday. If the government can’t meet the aid terms, “it’s up to Greece to figure out how to get financing without the euro zone’s help,” he later said in a speech to parliament. 
 
 Schaeuble travelled to a meeting of central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations in Marseille, France, today as they face calls to boost growth amid increasing threats from Europe’s debt crisis and a slowing global recovery. 
 
 Progress Report 
 
 The German government is awaiting the results of the Greek progress report and will decide what course of action then, a government spokesman said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
 
 European bank credit risk surged to an all-time high today and stocks fell worldwide on concern that the debt crisis is escalating. German two-year yields declined to a record as investors sought a haven and Greek two-year note yields added as much as 86 basis points to 55.91 percent, a euro-era record. 
 
 Credit-default swaps insuring Greek sovereign bonds jumped 212 basis points to a record 3,238, according to CMA. The five- year contracts signal there’s a 92 percent probability the country won’t meet its debt commitments. 
 
 “Countries must act now and act boldly to steer their economies through this dangerous new phase of the recovery,” International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a speech in London today. “We must not underestimate the risks of a further spread of economic weakness or even a debilitating liquidity crisis,” she said. “That is why action is needed urgently so banks can return to the business of financing economic activity.” 
 
 Barroso Meeting 
 
 Merkel, who is due to discuss the crisis with European Commission President Jose Barroso in Berlin on Sept. 12, is battling to secure a majority among her coalition bloc to push an overhaul of the European Financial Stability Facility through the lower house of parliament on Sept. 29. The changes would give the EFSF the power to buy bonds in the secondary market, raising German guarantees to 211 billion euros ($290 billion) from 123 billion euros. 
 
 Longer term, euro countries will “only preserve the common currency if there is more integration” in the European Union, Merkel said in a speech in Berlin today. The EU “won’t be able to avoid treaty change.” While intensive discussions lie ahead and the path won’t be easy, policy makers “shouldn’t be afraid” of tackling the challenge, she said. 
 
 Policy makers in Europe “are moving,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a Bloomberg Television interview from the G-7 in Marseille. “But I think they’re going to have to demonstrate to the world they have enough political will.”

 The ECB said Juergen Stark, a proponent of higher interest rates, would step down from its executive board by the end of the year, signaling a possible dispute among policy makers over how to combat the regional debt crisis. 
 
 Stark’s move came as financial leaders from the globe’s most developed nations met in France to devise a strategy to bolster the world economy. 
 
 Bank of America mulls major layoffs (3:24) Bank of America executives have discussed eliminating roughly 40,000 positions during a wave of restructuring — known as ""Project New BAC"" — that CEO Brian Moynihan is expected to discuss Monday, people familiar with the plans say. 
 
 Stocks’ losses intensified after Bloomberg News reported German officials were readying a plan to recapitalize German banks should their Greek holdings overcome balance sheets. 
 
 “Some in Europe are finally realizing that the money being funneled to Greece to buy time from the inevitable would be better put to use to recapitalize banks to insulate them from sovereign haircuts,” Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Milller Tabak, wrote in an email. 
 
 Sorensen at Charles Schwab said Europe is the dominant story for Wall Street and behind the ongoing volatility. 
 
 “We have fiscal issues here, but nobody is seriously considering that the United States is going to default or break apart,” said Sorensen in contrasting Europe to domestic concerns. 
 
 Stock-index futures had edged lower ahead of the ECB-related news as investors worried whether political gridlock in Washington would continue in the wake of President Barack Obama’s proposal unveiled Thursday night to create jobs and help lift the U.S. economy.

101,"Northwestern football players win pivotal union case. 
 
 Northwestern University football players on scholarship are employees of the school and therefore entitled to hold an election to decide whether to unionize, an official of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Wednesday. 
 
 The stunning decision, coming after a push by former quarterback Kain Colter backed by organized labor, has the potential to shake up the world of big-time college sports. 
 
 The National Collegiate Athletic Association and universities set the rules and cut the lucrative deals with TV networks and sponsors, exerting near total control over the activities of players known as ""student athletes."" But now those football players, at least at Northwestern, are employees too and may seek collective bargaining status, according to the 24-page ruling by Peter Sung Ohr, the regional director of the NLRB. 
 
 Ohr's decision is ""revolutionary for college sports,"" said Robert McCormick, a professor emeritus at the Michigan State University College of Law who focuses on sports and labor law. 
 
 Experts said the ruling could have wide impact beyond Northwestern's locker room, potentially influencing other players, schools, and state and federal agencies. For example, McCormick said that if college players demand compensation for injuries suffered during training or a game, Ohr's opinion could raise the question of whether they should be treated as employees under the state Workers' Compensation Act. 
 
 The decision also opens the door for athletes with scholarships at public universities to move more quickly to unionize because state labor boards, which govern public universities, usually follow labor law interpretations issued by the NLRB. 
 
 There were many questions left unanswered, including whether a union vote among Northwestern players would succeed, but Ohr's decision is preliminary. Northwestern immediately said it will appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and experts anticipate the case ultimately could be heard by the Supreme Court. 
 
 ""Northwestern believes strongly that our student-athletes are not employees, but students,"" Northwestern said in a statement. ""Unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes."" 
 
 Northwestern's football players are the first in college sports to seek union representation. Behind the effort is the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, a union funded by Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker who has become an advocate for players' rights. CAPA is backed by the United Steelworkers, which is covering the group's legal expenses. 
 
 ""This is a huge step toward justice for college athletes,"" Huma said. 
 
 He said the NCAA invented the term ""student-athletes"" 60 years ago in an attempt to prevent students from unionizing. Wednesday's decision, he said, asserts the rights of college athletes under labor law. 
 
 The union has said it would seek to negotiate over health and safety issues and does not intend to push for ""pay-for-play"" wages, which are not allowed under regulations issued by the NCAA. 
 
 Among its demands, CAPA is seeking financial coverage for former players with sports-related medical expenses, independent concussion experts to be placed on the sidelines during games and the creation of an educational trust fund to help former players graduate. 
 
 It also wants players to receive compensation for commercial sponsorships, which it says is consistent with ""evolving"" NCAA regulations. 
 
 In siding with the union, Ohr said the football players primarily have an economic relationship with the university, which controls and directs their daily activities and compensates them in the form of scholarships, which are worth about $76,000 per academic year if the player enrolls in summer classes. 
 
 ""The record makes clear that the employer's scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school,"" Ohr wrote. 
 
 Football players with scholarships, he said, ""fall squarely"" within in the labor law's definition of an employee. Ohr said those players spend many more hours on their football duties than on their studies. Furthermore, he said, the players are subject to special rules and policies that do not govern the general student population. 
 
 For example, he said, freshmen and sophomore students on scholarships are required to live on campus. Upperclassmen, he added, can live off campus but are required to submit their lease for approval to their coach, Pat Fitzgerald. 
 
 ""Even the players' academic lives are controlled as evidenced by the fact that they are required to attend study hall if they fail to maintain a certain grade-point average (GPA) in their classes,"" Ohr wrote. 
 
 Northwestern argued that the term ""student athlete"" is still appropriate. ""We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students, not a separate activity."" ||||| Northwestern football players qualify under federal law as employees of the university and, therefore, can legally form the nation's first college athletes' union, the National Labor Relations Board announced Wednesday. 
 
 “We had both the facts and the law on our side,” Gary Kohlman, the attorney representing the players, said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg News. 
 
 It's a stunning ruling, but hardly the final one on the matter. Northwestern has already announced plans to appeal the ruling by National Labor Relations Board regional director Peter Ohr to the full NLRB in Washington, D.C. After that, it probably will go through appellate courts and even the Supreme Court if necessary. 
 
 Outgoing Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter was the driving force behind forming the College Athletes Players Assn., which would take the lead of organizing the players if a union is formed. The legal bills have been paid by the United Steelworkers union. 
 
 CAPA attorneys have argued college football generates enormous amounts of profit on players' labor, which makes the players employees of the schools. CAPA said scholarships are the equivalent of payment, but not nearly enough. 
 
 Northwestern attorneys countered student-athletes shouldn't be categorized with unionized workers such as truck drivers or factory employees. It said scholarships aren't payments, they are grants. 
 
 The NCAA is facing increasing pressure, including multiple lawsuits, challenging its classification of athletes as amateurs. The focus of this particular case is for athletes to unionize at private schools because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities.

 FILE - In this Jan. 28, 2014, file photo, Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, right, speaks while College Athletes Players Association President Ramogi Huma listens during a news conference in Chicago.... (Associated Press) 
 
 The decision by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board means it agrees football players at the Big Ten school qualify as employees under federal law and therefore can legally unionize. 
 
 ""Based on the entire record in this case, I find that the Employer's football players who receive scholarships fall squarely within (federal labor law's) broad definition of 'employee,"" Peter Sung Ohr, the NLRB regional director, said in his 24-page decision. 
 
 An employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers. Players argued that their scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers. 
 
 The Evanston, Ill-based university argued college athletes, as students, don't fit in the same category as factory workers, truck drivers and other unionized workers. Immediately after the ruling, the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in Washington, D.C. 
 
 Alan Cubbage, Northwestern's vice president for university relations, said in a statement that while the school respects ""the NLRB process and the regional director's opinion, we disagree with it."" 
 
 The specific goals of the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, which would take the lead in organizing the players, include guaranteeing coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former players, ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships. 
 
 But critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could hurt college sports in numerous ways, including by raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players or lockouts by athletic departments. 
 
 For now, the push is to unionize athletes at private schools, such as Northwestern, because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. 
 
 Outgoing Wildcats quarterback Kain Colter took a leading role in establishing CAPA. The United Steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills. 
 
 Colter, whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the NFL draft, said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the Wildcats roster backed the union bid, though only he expressed his support publicly. 
 
 CAPA attorneys argued that college football is, for all practical purposes, a commercial enterprise that relies on players' labor to generate billions of dollars in profits. That, they contend, makes the relationship of schools to players one of employers to employees. 
 
 In its endeavor to have college football players be recognized as essential workers, CAPA likened scholarships to employment pay — too little pay from its point of view. Northwestern balked at that claim, describing scholarship as grants. 
 
 The NCAA has been under increasing scrutiny over its amateurism rules and is fighting a class-action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts, memorabilia sales and video games. Other lawsuits allege the NCAA failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries. 
 
 NCAA President Mark Emmert has pushed for a $2,000-per-player stipend to help athletes defray some of expenses. Critics say that isn't nearly enough, considering players help bring in millions of dollars to their schools and conferences. 
 
 During the NLRB's five days of hearings in February, Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents, and his testimony sometimes was at odds with Colter's. 
 
 Colter told the hearing that players' performance on the field was more important to Northwestern than their in-class performance, saying, ""You fulfill the football requirement and, if you can, you fit in academics."" Asked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of $75,000 a year, he responded: ""To play football. To perform an athletic service."" 
 
 But Fitzgerald said he tells players academics come first, saying, ""We want them to be the best they can be ... to be a champion in life."" 
 
 An attorney representing the university, Alex Barbour, noted Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation, around 97 percent. Barbour insisted, ""Northwestern is not a football factory.""

 The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours over the incident. The initial lockdown was partially lifted but reporters still aren't allowed to go to certain areas on the White House grounds. 
 
 Police sealed off traffic on streets near the White House, and Pennsylvania Avenue was shut to pedestrians. Officers with rifles patrolled the area. 
 
 On 15th Street, clusters of tourists were held at street corners. Many were checking smartphones for news reports on the incident. “I guess we won’t be walking to the White House today,” one man said. 
 
 Sirens blared throughout the mid-day and a chopper hovered overhead at one point. 
 
 The president spent the morning at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.Trump is expected to return to Washington this evening to attend the annual Gridiron Dinner hosted by Washington political journalists. 
 
 This is the second lockdown at the White House in less than 10 days. A Tennessee woman intentionally rammed her car into a barrier outside of the White House on Feb. 23.

103,"Netflix Inc. has recruited prolific television producer Shonda Rhimes, the creator of ABC hits such as “Scandal” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” the clearest sign yet of an arms race for talent between new and old entertainment industry giants. 
 
 Under the terms of the multiyear exclusive agreement, Netflix said Ms. Rhimes, whose credits also include “How to Get Away with Murder,” would develop new shows for the streaming service. She will move her production company ShondaLand from its current base at Walt Disney Co.’s ABC Studios to... ||||| Netflix has signed Shonda Rhimes to a multi-year production deal, ending a 15-year relationship with ABC Studios that yielded hits from “Grey’s Anatomy” to “Scandal.” 
 
 Her shingle, Shondaland, will begin producing new series for Netflix while she continues to stay involved in her current broadcast series. Executive producer Betsy Beers will also come to Netflix with Rhimes, one of the most successful TV producers of the past decade. 
 
 “Shonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, Netflix, in a statement. “Her work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best. I’ve gotten the chance to know Shonda and she’s a true Netflixer at heart — she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience. We’re so excited to welcome her to Netflix.” 
 
 Rhimes has been a consistent supplier of successful dramas for ABC, including most recently “How to Get Away With Murder” and “Scandal.” Her first series for ABC, medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” was a home run out of the gate and is heading in to its 14th season this fall. A “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff is also in the works. 
 
 Netflix is familiar with the Shondaland milieu. The streaming service has long carried older episodes of “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal” and “HTGAWM” in the U.S., and in select markets around the world. 
 
 The Rhimes pact reflects Netflix’s increasing interest in producing original series the company can own, as well as the arms race continuing to escalate between not only the streaming service and TV networks, but other subscriber VOD options like Amazon Prime and Hulu. Earlier this week, Amazon signed on another proven hitmaker, Robert Kirkman, creator of AMC’s megahit “The Walking Dead.” 
 
 Netflix has been a whirlwind of activity as of late, signing filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen to a deal for a series, “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.” The company also just made its first acquisition, Millarworld, which will yield intellectual property from a roster of comics that have yielded movies in the past from “Kickass” to the “Kingsman” franchise. 
 
 The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed Rhimes was earning an estimated $10 million a year under her previous ABC Studios pact. Netflix undoubtedly is paying a premium to Rhimes and in overhead for Shondaland to bring her into the fold under the exclusive deal. The complicated deal is believed to include innovative backend profit definitions for Rhimes to accommodate for the lack of syndication opportunities for programs produced for Netflix’s global platform. The deal was hammered out by Rhimes’ longtime reps at ICM Partners and attorney Michael Gendler. 
 
 The deal has been in the works for months. Rhimes’ existing pact with ABC Studios had been set to expire in June 2018. It’s understood that Rhimes let the studio know some time ago that she intended to move on after the deal ended — not to a direct broadcast competitor but to a new chapter of her career. At that point, discussions ensued to allow Rhimes an early exit from the deal. 
 
 The Shondaland operation is expected to remain based out of Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, where “Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder” are shot. 
 
 “Shondaland’s move to Netflix is the result of a shared plan Ted Sarandos and I built based on my vision for myself as a storyteller and for the evolution of my company,” said Rhimes in a statement. “Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix.” 
 
 “I am a huge fan of the talented team and amazing programming at Netflix,” said Beers. “The ability to create content for our new partners is an exciting challenge. I am grateful to everyone at ABC for their continued support and I look forward to beginning this next chapter at Netflix.” 
 
 The network and studio arms of ABC issued statements thanking Rhimes for her work for the Disney-owned TV properties, and assuring that the “TGIT” lineup is to continue airing. ” I’m proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked about shows on television,” said ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey. “With the launch of a new season upon us, fans can rest assured that TGIT remains intact and will be as buzzed about as ever.” 
 
 A good deal of Rhimes-related series are still in the pipeline at ABC Studios, which also has numerous overall deals with showrunners associated with her shows. Another Shondaland series, “For the People,” is expected to bow in the midseason. Rhimes is committed to maintaining her involvement in the “TGIT” series. She’s taking a hands-on role in the final season of “Scandal.” She hammered out the roadmap for the Washington, D.C.-based sudser and is said to be penning multiple episodes. 
 
 But for Rhimes, the move to Netflix offers a chance to work in a variety of genres and formats that are beyond the scope of broadcast TV. In Netflix’s subscription environment, there’s more creative freedom to produce limited and recurring series of various episode lengths, and there’s flexibility even in the length of each episode. That is attractive to Rhimes. The producer has already proved herself in the broadcast arena, breaking ground with “Scandal” and “HTGAWM” in fielding series with African-American female leads. 
 
 The Netflix deal comes just days after ABC’s parent company seemed to have done the streaming service the disservice of opting not to renew Disney and Pixar movies when their licenses expire in 2019. The conglomerate also just announced plans to launch a pair of new streaming services, one from ESPN and another with a mix of Disney-related content that could provide a challenger to Netflix. 
 
 But Disney CEO Bob Iger played down the notion of any rivalry between the two companies, noting a range of other pacts that are still in place. Disney and Netflix are also negotiating over the future of films currently on the streaming service from Lucasfilm and Marvel. 
 
 Cynthia Littleton contributed to this report.","– Netflix has scored a major coup by landing one of the top producers in television.

 The French government is being sued over the way it has sought to take over the France.com web domain. 
 
 In 2015, France started legal action against Frenchman Jean-Noel Frydman, who had registered France.com in 1994. 
 
 Two years later, a French court ruled in France's favour and the government began to lobby domain host web.com to take control away from Mr Frydman. 
 
 And now Mr Frydman, who built a business around the domain, says France has ""illegally"" seized the site. 
 
 He says France.com was taken away from him without warning in mid-March. 
 
 And he has now begun legal action in Virginia in a bid to regain control of it. 
 
 Image copyright EPA Image caption The French government has been accused of illegally seizing the France.com domain 
 
 Mr Frydman is suing the French Republic, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Atout France tourist agency and domain registrar Verisign. 
 
 He alleges the government did not ask to license or buy the domain and instead ""misused"" the legal system to seize it. 
 
 'Bad faith' 
 
 ""If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone,"" Mr Frydman told technology news site Ars Technica. 
 
 He said he had run France.com as an information hub for French people and fans of French culture living in the US. 
 
 And much of the information about French culture and events had been generated with the help of French government agencies, including its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
 But, despite this continuing official collaboration, the 2015 legal action had alleged that France.com had been acting in ""bad faith"" and did not have official permission to use the domain. 
 
 Mr Frydman has set up a website called unfairfrance.com detailing the history of France.com and the extent of its collaboration with the French state. 
 
 Web.com has not yet responded to a request for comment. ||||| In April of 2015, the State of France launched a legal battle – in France – to expropriate the domain name France.com, without any indemnification, from its rightful owner: the United States company France.com, Inc, claiming the latter had registered the domain name in bad faith and had not been authorized by the French state to use it. 
 
 This assertion is not only groundless and absurd, it’s entirely dishonest. This website presents the 20+ years of constant partnership between France.com and various entities and branches of the French government who were not only aware of France.com’s existence, but consistently encouraged and supported its initiatives and activities.

 “Don’t steal! The government hates competition.” (Libertarian slogan) ||||| A French-born American has now sued his home country because, he claims, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has illegally seized a domain that he’s owned since 1994: France.com 
 
 In the mid-1990s, Jean-Noël Frydman bought France.com from Web.com and set up a website to serve as a ""digital kiosk"" for Francophiles and Francophones in the United States. 
 
 For over 20 years, Frydman built up a business (also known as France.com), often collaborating with numerous official French agencies, including the Consulate General in Los Angeles and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
 However, sometime around 2015, that very same ministry initiated a lawsuit in France in an attempt to wrest control of the France.com domain away from Frydman. Web.com locked the domain, and Frydman even roped in the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard Law School to intervene on his behalf. 
 
 By September 2017, the Paris Court of Appeals ruled that France.com was violating French trademark law. Armed with this ruling, lawyers representing the French state wrote to Web.com demanding that the domain be handed over. 
 
 Finally, on March 12, 2018, Web.com abruptly transferred ownership of the domain to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The company did so without any formal notification to Frydman and no compensation. 
 
 ""I'm probably [one of Web.com's] oldest customers,"" Frydman told Ars. ""I've been with them for 24 years... There's never been any cases against France.com, and they just did that without any notice. I've never been treated like that by any company anywhere in the world. If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone.""

 On April 19, Frydman filed a federal lawsuit in Virginia in an attempt to get his domain name back. The suit names the French Republic, Atout France (a government tourism agency), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the minister himself (Jean-Yves Le Drian), and VeriSign as defendants. 
 
 None of the defendants has yet made a formal appearance in the Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom. 
 
 Web.com, the original registrar, is not a party to the lawsuit. However, the company seems to have taken it upon itself to heed the French legal ruling and give up the France.com domain name without a fight. 
 
 As Frydman's civil complaint states: 
 
 Prior to the incidents complained of in this lawsuit, Defendants did not object to nor challenge Plaintiff's ownership or use of <France.com>. To the contrary, and as previously demonstrated in Exhibit A, Defendants publicly recognized Plaintiff as a leader in the tourism industry. In 2015, Defendants began expressing an interest in owning the <France.com> domain name and exploiting it for Defendants' own use. Defendants did not approach Plaintiff to purchase or license the domain, the trademark, or Plaintiff's underlying business and goodwill. Instead, in 2015, Defendants misused the French judicial system to seize the domain from Plaintiff without compensation, under the erroneous theory that Defendants were inherently entitled to take the domain because it included the word ""France."" Defendants knew that they did not, and do not, have a right to the word ""France,"" as evidenced by Defendant Atout France's US Trademark Registration No. 4027580, filed in 2009, in which Defendant expressly disclaimed the exclusive right to the word ""France."" 
 
 The lawsuit accuses France of cybersquatting France.com and ""reverse domain-name hijacking,"" among other allegations. 
 
 Web.com's chief legal officer, Matt McClure, did not respond to Ars' request for comment. 
 
 ""They claim to be a company that's good for small businesses,"" Frydman said. ""What a joke. They've been absolutely horrible, not even answering our emails."" ||||| Back in 1994, the year the World Wide Web was actually born, a man by the name of Jean-Noël Frydman was smart enough to buy a domain that would soon become one of the Internet's most sought-after. 
 
 The French expat snapped up France.com from Web.com and set up a “digital kiosk” website for French speakers in the US. 
 
 As the world became increasingly dependent on all things digital, business grew for Frydman, who would regularly be approached by French government institutions to collaborate on campaigns on his coveted website. 
 
 However, the relationship had soured by 2015, with France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs launching a lawsuit to expropriate the domain from its owner. 
 
 Web.com blocked the transfer but French authorities did not desist. In 2017, Paris's Court of Appeals ruled that France.com was violating French trademark law and by March 2018, Web.com had caved in and abruptly handed over ownership of France.com to the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
 ""I've been with them Web.com for 24 years,” Miami-based Frydman told tech news site Ars Technica. 
 
 “There's never been any cases against France.com, and they just did that without any notice. “ 
 
 On April 19th 2018, Frydman filed a federal lawsuit in Virginia against the French Republic itself, government tourism agency Atout France and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as its head Jean-Yves Le Drian. 
 
 He's accusing them of ""abusing the French judicial system to seize the plaintiff's estate without compensation, under the erroneous theory that the Defendants inherently had the right to take the estate because it included the word ""France"""". 
 
 ""The defendants knew that they did not have, and do not have, a right to the word ""France"", as evidenced by the registration of the American brand Atout France under the number 4027580, filed in 2009, in which the defendant expressly waived the exclusive right to the word ""France"". 
 
 According to French tech site Siecle Digital, Frydman has a chance of winning the case, in part because at no point before the expropriation did French authorities put in a bid to legitimately buy the domain from him. 
 
 Frydman will be using VeriSign as defendants, an Internet company that has full licensing control over .com and .net domains. 
 
 None of the defendants has yet made a formal appearance at the US courtroom. 
 
 Currently if users type in France.com into their search browser they are redirected to France.fr, France's official brand website. 
 
 According to Frydman's LinkedIn profile, ""France.com was a pioneer in the use of the Internet for publication. 
 
 ""It was the first company to distribute a daily French national newspaper on the Internet (Le Monde); the first to publish an online travel guide to France; the first to create an online hotel booking engine. 
 
 ""Its other early innovations include the first viral success of the French-speaking Internet (Les Webs d'Or), and the world's first hotel comments platform (à la TripAdvisor)."" 
 
 As a final word of warning Frydman has said: I've never been treated like that by any company anywhere in the world. If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone.""","– For 24 years, Jean-Noël Frydman owned a tres formidable web domain: France.com. Now he's suing to get it back. The French-born American shares his saga with Ars Technica, which reports that after buying the domain in 1994, Frydman built a site catering to US-based French speakers. In the process, he worked with French agencies, among them the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the federal suit he filed in Virginia, around 2015 the ministry began warming to the idea of having the domain for itself, but didn't offer to buy Frydman out. Instead, it seized the domain through what Frydman alleges was a ""[misuse of] the French judicial system"" revolving around ""the erroneous theory that Defendants were inherently entitled to take the domain because it included the word 'France.'"" As for those judicial maneuverings, Ars Technica explains the Paris Court of Appeals last September ruled a violation of trademark law had occurred, and the country's lawyers then reached out to Web.com—Frydman says he's probably one of its oldest customers—requesting a transfer of the domain, which was granted March 12. Frydman says he was neither notified about the move nor paid anything for the domain. The Local reports that France.com currently redirects to the country's official France.fr site. As for Frydman, he's not wholly without a website, notes the BBC: He's currently running unfairfrance.com, which catalogs ""the 20+ years of constant partnership between France.com and various entities and branches of the French government who ... consistently encouraged and supported its initiatives and activities.""

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| A French aviation expert believes he may have found the wreckage of MH370 – the Malaysia Airlines flight which disappeared off the coast of Malaysia in March 2014. 
 
 Xavier Tytelman, a former military pilot who now specialises in aviation security, was contacted on Wednesday morning by a man living on the island of Reunion, in the Indian Ocean. The man sent Mr Tytelman a series of photos showing wreckage of a plane, which the Frenchman said could possibly be the missing jet.

 ""I've been studying hundreds of photos and speaking to colleagues,"" Mr Tytelman told The Telegraph. ""And we all think it is likely that the wing is that of a Boeing 777 – the same plane as MH370. 
 
 ""Police in Reunion examining the wreckage say that it looks like it's been in the water for around a year, which again would fit with MH370. We can't say for certainty, but we do think there is a chance that this is it."" 
 
 Similitudes incroyables entre le flaperon d'un #B777 et le débris retrouvé ce matin à #LaReunion... #MH370 ? pic.twitter.com/GDkzRLwi2h — Xavier Tytelman (@PeurAvion) July 29, 2015 
 
 The plane vanished with 239 people on board in circumstances which have baffled investigators, and left distraught families searching for answers. 
 
 Wild theories emerged about the plane: that it had landed in Diego Garcia, or flown on to North Korea. 
 
 But Mr Tytelman believes that the Indian Ocean location makes sense for wreckage of the plane to have washed up. 
 
 ""The French police are now looking at it, and the Australians – who are in charge of the search – are interested too,"" he said. ""We don't know how long it will take to get confirmation or a definite denial. But it's an intriguing development."" 
 
 Writing on his blog, Mr Tytelman said that the photos of the wreckage had aroused significant interest on the AvGeek website – a closed forum for pilots. 
 
 He said that there was much discussion over a code part of the wreckage: BB670. 
 
 ""The code is not that of a plane number plate, nor that or a serial number on machinery,"" he wrote. 
 
 ""But if the flaperon does indeed belong to MH370, it's clear that the reference will be swiftly identified. In a few days we will have a definitive answer."" ||||| (CNN) Debris found in the western Indian Ocean on Wednesday appears to be part of a Boeing 777, the same model as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared in 2014, according to a source close to the investigation. 
 
 The source said there is a unique element to the Boeing 777's flaperon, a wing component, that Boeing observers believe they are seeing in photos. 
 
 The debris was found Wednesday off the coast of Reunion Island, a French department in the western Indian Ocean. It is being examined to determine whether it is connected to flight MH370 , a member of the French air force in Reunion said Wednesday. 
 
 The debris was found off the coast of St. Andre, a community on the island, according to Adjutant Christian Retournat. 
 
 Boeing officials conducted an initial assessment of the debris using photographs. The source stressed the observations are preliminary. 
 
 Police carry a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found off the coast of Reunion island. 
 
 K.S. Narendran, whose wife was on the plane, said he was reticent to call the discovery a major development. 
 
 ""I think this is very early days yet. All we know is that a small part has been found. It is still a little early to suggest it does belong to MH370,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" from India. ""I think it is premature to feel that it is all coming to a close or that we are even closer to the truth."" 
 
 Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on MH370, said her ""heart has been in my throat for most of the day."" 
 
 During the initial days of the search for the plane, there were several reports of possible debris sightings in the waters closer to where authorities believe the plane went down, but none of those was actual wreckage. Bajc said as an emotional safety mechanism she disbelieves any reports like Wednesday's discovery. 
 
 She wants verification, she told ""Anderson Cooper 360˚."" 
 
 ""If ultimately this is the piece of the wing, then that little thread of hope that I have been holding on to will, will have to break. And reality will have to take over,"" she said holding back tears. ""But, yeah, up until now, I and most of the family members have continued to believe that until we have a body ... we can't give up hoping they will still come back."" 
 
 If this turns out to be a piece of MH370, it would be the first piece of physical evidence that the plane crashed. 
 
 Malaysian team en route 
 
 Earlier, Retournat said the debris appeared to be a wing flap and had been taken to the island, about 380 nautical miles off the coast of Madagascar. 
 
 The Malaysian government has dispatched a team to Reunion Island to investigate the debris, Malaysian Minister of Transportation Liow Tiong Lai said in New York. 
 
 ""We need to verify. We have wreckage found that needs to be further verified before we can further confirm if it belongs to MH370. So we have dispatched a team to investigate on these issues and we hope that we can identify it as soon as possible,"" the minister said. 
 
 Malaysia Airlines said it was working with authorities to determine where the part came from. 
 
 ""At the moment, it would be too premature for the airline to speculate on the origin of the flaperon,"" the carrier said. 
 
 CNN analysts said there are indications the airplane part could be from a Boeing 777, and if that's the case, it's likely from MH370. 
 
 Making the determination should be ""very simple"" because the serial numbers riveted to numerous parts of the plane can be linked to not only the plane's model, but also the exact aircraft, said CNN aviation analyst Les Abend, who flew 777s during his 30 years as a pilot. 
 
 This means crash investigators may be able to figure it out from photographs of the part, which could be an aileron, a flap or a flaperon, even before arriving on the island, he said. 
 
 Several clues 
 
 Airplane debris is being examined to see if it's connected to MH370. 
 
 There are at least three elements of the discovery that are consistent with MH370, said CNN safety analyst David Soucie. The first is that the part appears to have been torn off the aircraft. 
 
 ""This is from a sudden impact, it looks like to me,"" Soucie said. 
 
 There also is a seal on the top of the part that ""is consistent with what I would see on an inside flap on a triple 7,"" he said, and the barnacles on the part are consistent with the ""parasitic activity"" that would take place from being underwater so long. 
 
 However, the part appears to be coated in white paint, which would run counter to Soucie's other observations in that the 777's parts would be coated in zinc chromate, not paint. Soucie acknowledged, however, that the part could be coated in something from the ocean. 
 
 ""If it is a part from a triple 7, we can be fairly confident it is from 370 because there just haven't been that many triple 7 crashes and there haven't been any in this area,"" said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo. 
 
 Antoine Forestier, a journalist on the island where the debris was found, said people who were on shore gardening saw the plane part drifting in the ocean. 
 
 Reporters from Antenne Reunion looked at the debris, which Forestier said was about 2 meters by 1 meter (6.5 feet by 3 feet). 
 
 There was a marking ""BB670"" on the part. 
 
 Soucie said he believes the number is a part number, though it might be from a subcontractor. 
 
 Drift possibilities 
 
 The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency tasked by Malaysia with leading the search for MH370, said the piece of debris is ""not inconsistent"" with drift modeling done by Australian authorities. 
 
 ""If there was something from MH370 it could have reached Reunion Island from the area we're covering,"" said ATSB Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan. ""It's not inconsistent with the drift modeling we've done. It's not inconsistent with the search area we're covering."" 
 
 Dolan would not say how likely it was that any debris would move in a westerly direction. 
 
 ""There's a range of possibilities,"" he said. ""It's not an exact science."" Dolan said surface currents, wind direction and how high an object was floating in the water might all play a role.

 Questions linger 
 
 Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , with 239 people aboard, disappeared after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, early on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing. 
 
 Authorities have said they still don't know why it turned dramatically off course over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, or where exactly its errant journey finished. 
 
 An international team of experts used satellite data to calculate that the plane eventually went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Search teams have been combing a vast area of the seafloor in the southern Indian Ocean, hunting for traces of the passenger jet, about 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) from where the debris was found. 
 
 Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told Nine Network Australia that if the debris discovered off Reunion is determined to be from Flight 370, it's ""not really going to be all that helpful in pinpointing precisely where the aircraft is."" 
 
 But he said Thursday that it would provide ""further evidence that we're searching in roughly the right place.""","– Debris has washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean and is raising hopes that the fate of the Malaysian passenger jet that vanished last year might finally be known—though it wouldn't be the first false alarm. A French aviation expert tells the Telegraph that plane wreckage washed ashore on Reunion Island. ""I've been studying hundreds of photos and speaking to colleagues,"" says Xavier Tytelman. ""And we all think it is likely that the wing is that of a Boeing 777—the same plane as MH370."" He says authorities from Australia in charge of the search are investigating. This French-language blog has photos. A member of the French Air Force tells CNN that the piece appears to be wing flap, but ""it is way too soon to say whether or not it is MH370—we just found the debris this morning."" The island is about 380 nautical miles from the Madagascar coast. MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, after taking off from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with 239 people aboard. It was bound for Beijing, and its disappearance has baffled aviation officials.","<pad> – The plane's wing is likely to be that of a Boeing 777, and we can't say for certainty, but we do think there is a chance that this is it,"" Xavier Tytelman tells the Telegraph. ""We can't say for certainty, but we do think there is a chance that this is it.""

 Researchers show how the judicious choice of fluid filler can suppress the turbulent flow that severely hinders the “top-kill” plugging of a blown-out oil well.

 toggle caption Jonathan Makiri/NPR 
 
 While you were thumbing through your Feb. 4 issue of Physical Review Letters, perhaps you noticed the article titled ""Viscoelastic Suppression of Gravity-Driven Counterflow Instability."" 
 
 OK, maybe not. But it was actually worth a look. It turns out the article describes how engineers might have been able to stop the BP blowout in the Gulf of Mexico last year using a child's plaything: oobleck. It's a weird mixture of cornstarch and water. When it moves slowly, it flows like a liquid. Move it fast, and it freezes into a solid. 
 
 The idea of using oobleck came to Jonathan Katz, a physics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, last May. He was on a small group of experts that U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu pulled together to advise him about the catastrophe. 
 
 So Katz was on hand when BP tried to stop the well by pumping a dense fluid called drilling mud down it — the so-called top-kill approach. It failed. 
 
 ""We'd predicted that [would fail], so we were disappointed like everybody else was, but not enormously surprised,"" Katz says. ""And so I was scratching my head and saying, 'Is there some solution to this problem?' "" 
 
 Make Your Own Oobleck Oobleck is remarkably easy to make: Just combine 2 parts cornstarch to 1 part water. Slowly stir in the cornstarch into the water. Mix slowly — you'll find that the more aggressive the stirring, the harder it is. Add a few drops of food coloring if you wish. 
 
 Oobleck Vs. Oil 
 
 The problem, as Katz saw it, was that oil and gas blasting up the well tended to break up the drilling mud into fine particles, and a light mist like that ends up getting shot up the pipe and dumped onto the seafloor. 
 
 Katz wondered whether there was some kind of fluid that wouldn't immediately be dispersed into tiny particles when it encountered the rapidly flowing oil. 
 
 ""I realized after a while that cornstarch suspension — oobleck, the kids call it — has this wonderful property that if it's not flowing rapidly, it's a liquid that flows pretty well,"" Katz says. ""But if you try to make it flow rapidly, it suddenly turns stiff and it doesn't flow at all."" 
 
 Oobleck versus a stream of bubbling hot oil? Really? Yep. 
 
 ""I made some rough estimates; it looked like it was going to work,"" Katz says. 
 
 And Katz had an inside track here — being on the energy secretary's advisory panel, he participated in daily telephone briefings and frequent e-mail exchanges. He had about as much access as you could hope. 
 
 ""So I certainly sent it to everybody on the lists. I don't know who read it — you can never tell,"" he says. 
 
 But Katz was dismissed from the panel shortly thereafter because of some controversial social opinions on his website. Even so, Katz says he still dreamed that his solution could solve the problem and end in triumph. Of course it didn't work out that way. 
 
 ""I don't fault the pros,"" he says. ""They have a toolbox; they use the tools in their toolbox. This isn't the place to do physics experiments, especially one that would cost quite a bit of money."" 
 
 Cornstarch is cheap, but the rest of the operation would not be. 
 
 ""And of course the drilling mud industry isn't used to mixing cornstarch into their stuff, so it was completely new for them,"" he says. ""It wasn't something they had available in their tanks ready to go. They would have had to prepare a custom solution and take it out to the well."" 
 
 A Pumping Problem 
 
 And that was not going to happen. Instead, after BP stopped the well through more conventional means, Katz and some associates at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory did a small-scale experiment with the cornstarch mixture and mineral oil. 
 
 They report in that Physical Review Letters article that it performed as Katz had predicted under these highly idealized circumstances. Whether it would have worked in the real world is an open question. Prof. Steve Wereley, who teaches fluid dynamics at Purdue University, says the concept is clever. 
 
 ""The problem with using something like cornstarch and water is getting it where it needs to be,"" Wereley says. 
 
 You'd have to pump a lot of it, fast, into the well if it's going to work. And there might be trouble pumping it — remember, oobleck gets stiff when it's put under pressure. 
 
 ""It would tend to create that same reaction when you're trying to pump it down the hole."" 
 
 Wereley calculates that you'd have to pump it so slowly that you couldn't get it down the hole faster than the oil was rushing up. And that's a big problem. 
 
 A BP spokeswoman told NPR their engineers reviewed the idea and decided it wouldn't work. But Katz still figures it's a good idea worth exploring for the next time an oil well is running completely out of control.","– From a month-old copy of Physical Review Letters, NPR stumbled on an article bearing the somewhat impenetrable title, ""Viscoelastic Suppression of Gravity-Driven Counterflow Instability."" Behind the mouthful was an interesting premise: That the calamitous BP well could have been plugged using oobleck. The combination of two parts cornstarch to one part water, which takes its name from Dr. Seuss's Bartholomew and the Oobleck, is a bizarre substance that flows like a liquid at slow speeds, and turns solid at fast. The idea is the brainchild of physics professor Jonathan Katz, who noted that in the failed top-kill approach, the oil and gas rocketing up the well broke the drilling mud into fine particles. That made him wonder whether there was a fluid that wouldn't share the same fate—and then he thought of oobleck. Katz, who was on the energy secretary's advisory panel, sent out his idea; but he was cut from the panel a short time later due to some controversial social opinions on his website. The report in Physical Review Letters notes that when Katz experimented with the mixture and mineral oil under highly idealized circumstances, it did indeed work. A BP spokeswoman told NPR its engineers decided the idea wouldn't fly, and one professor of fluid dynamics points out another issue: Because oobleck turns into a solid at fast speeds, he calculated that you'd have to pump it so slowly that you couldn't get it down the hole faster than the oil was coming up.","<pad> – Cornstarch could have been a solution to the BP oil well's failure, but he's not sure if it was a child's plaything.

 Britain immediately raised concerns about Ghoncheh Ghavami's trial. The case highlighted the limits to free expression inside Iran and efforts by authorities to enforce strict interpretations of Islamic norms despite a policy of greater openness being pursued by moderate President Hassan Rouhani. 
 
 The 25-year-old woman's brother, Iman Ghavami, said the family had been hoping she would be set free based on time already served since her June arrest. They are still trying to get official details of the verdict, he said. 
 
 ""We're disappointed and kind of shocked. We really hoped she'd be released,"" he told The Associated Press. 
 
 Ghavami's lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, said in an interview that a court found her guilty of ""propagating against the ruling system."" Tabatabaei said he was shown the text of the verdict but is still waiting to receive it officially. 
 
 ""I was told at the court today that my client's case has been referred back to the prosecutor because Ghavami is facing new charges. So, the verdict was not given to me,"" he said. 
 
 Tabatabaei didn't elaborate what the new charges are or why fresh charges have been raised against his client now. 
 
 Ghavami was detained in June at Tehran's Freedom Stadium after trying to attend a men's volleyball match between Iran and Italy. 
 
 She is a graduate of the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies and had been volunteering to help street kids in Iran for a few months, her brother said. 
 
 Women are banned from attending male-only matches in Iran. Ghavami tried to enter the stadium with other women to protest the ban, according to Amnesty International. Female photographers inside the complex were also ordered to leave, though none was arrested. 
 
 Ghavami was held along with the other protesters for a few hours before being released. She was detained again a few days later and stood trial last month. Her brother said she had no access to her lawyer until it came time for her court hearing. 
 
 ""This whole case has been full of abnormalities,"" Iman Ghavami said. 
 
 Ghavami has been held in solitary confinement for much of her time at Tehran's Evin prison, according to Amnesty. She went on hunger strike at one point last month to protest her detention. 
 
 The rights group sharply criticized Sunday's verdict and called Ghavami a prisoner of conscience. 
 
 ""It's an outrage that a young woman is being locked up simply for peacefully having her say about how women are discriminated against in Iran,"" Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said. 
 
 Iman Ghavami said he believes authorities singled out his sister from the other female protesters because she holds both British and Iranian citizenship. Iranian authorities do not recognize dual nationalities for its citizens and treats them as Iranians under law. 
 
 The British Foreign Office expressed doubts about the sentence Sunday. 
 
 ""We have concerns about the grounds for this prosecution, due process during the trial and Miss Ghavami's treatment whilst in custody,"" it said in a statement. 
 
 Iran's moderate President Rouhani has faced resistance from hard-liners who feel he is too soft on those who challenge strict interpretations of Islam. 
 
 In one case earlier this year, six young Iranian men and women who shot a video of themselves dancing together and unveiled to Pharrell Williams' ""Happy"" were arrested along with the film's director for allegedly breeching Islamic norms. They received suspended sentences of jail terms and lashes in September. 
 
 Iran's judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehi, has criticized reports linking Ghavami's arrest to volleyball, saying last month: ""Her case has nothing to do with sports.""

 A British-Iranian woman detained at a men's volleyball match in Iran has been sentenced to a year in prison, her lawyer says. 
 
 Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was found guilty of spreading anti-regime propaganda, lawyer Alizadeh Tabatabaie said. 
 
 Iran banned women from volleyball games in 2012, extending a long-standing ban on football matches. 
 
 The Iranian authorities have argued that women need protection from the lewd behaviour of male fans. 
 
 Britain's Foreign Office said it was concerned about the sentence.

 Amnesty International has described Ms Ghavami, who is from Shepherd's Bush in west London, as a prisoner of conscience, and called for her immediate release. More than 700,000 people have signed an online petition urging the authorities to free her. 
 
 The graduate of the University of London's School of African and Oriental Studies was part of a group of women who tried to watch Iran play Italy in a match on 20 June. 
 
 The women were arrested and allegedly beaten before being freed. 
 
 Ms Ghavami was rearrested later and subsequently put on trial. She launched a hunger strike in October after being held in isolation cells. ||||| An Iranian court has sentenced a British-Iranian woman to a year in jail for protesting a ban on women attending volleyball games, according to her lawyer and the semiofficial ILNA news agency. 
 
 Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested outside Tehran's Azadi Stadium in June while taking part in a demonstration against the ban, which was enacted in 2012, according to Amnesty International. The protest took place while Iran was playing Italy inside the stadium. 
 
 The volleyball ban joined an existing ban on women attending soccer games. The government says the laws are intended to protect women from exposure to unruly men at sporting events. 
 
 Ghavami's lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, told The Times that he was informally shown the verdict against his client but had not received official notification. 
 
 Amnesty International said Ghavami had been charged with ""propaganda against the regime."" 
 
 According to the London-based organization, she was beaten during her arrest, and was eventually incarcerated at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison. She reportedly went on a 14-day hunger strike in early October to protest the conditions of her detention.

 Alizadeh told ILNA (the Iranian Labor News Agency) that he hoped the court would roll back its sentence. ""There is hope to get clemency for my client as she had a clean record before getting arrested,"" he said. 
 
 However, in an interview with The Times, he said that authorities have threatened to try Ghavami again on unspecified additional charges. 
 
 ""They have not given concrete reasons, but they have announced to me the new accusations raised against Ghoncheh based on new evidence,"" he said. He added that his client ""has not been indicted and she was not given her new accusations [but] she will be retried."" 
 
 He added that he had never had an opportunity to meet with his client outside court. 
 
 ""According to the court’s verdict, I, as the lawyer, can meet my client,"" he said, ""but due to unknown reasons, this visit has not happened yet and I have not met my client apart from the session in the court.""

Kirk's comment is even more politically troublesome because all of his potential Democratic opponents who have either announced or are considering bids are women, and two of them are African-American. 
 
 Politico reported that Kirk said he regretted the statement when asked about it. His press secretary, Danielle Varallo, said in an email that ""Senator Kirk was joking with his colleague and immediately apologized to anyone offended by his remark."" 
 
 ""Sen. Kirk said he regrets the comments,"" Graham said in a statement. "" I believe that is the appropriate response."" 
 
 Two announced Democratic candidates for Kirk's Senate seat were less forgiving. 
 
 U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth seized on Kirk's comment as a fundraising opportunity in an email sent to supporters by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who said under Duckworth's letterhead: ""It's beyond inappropriate for a U.S. Senator to make a joke referring to women as 'Hos' — and it's also reflective of Mark Kirk's broader anti-woman legislative record."" 
 
 Andrea Zopp, a former prosecutor with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, said in a statement that, ""No woman, let alone a woman like me, an African-American and mother of two daughters ... who has spent much of her career overcoming sexist and racist stereotypes would think his remark either appropriate or funny."" 
 
 ""Clueless or reckless?"" Zopp asked. 
 
 A third potential opponent is Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Matteson, who also is African-American. 
 
 Kirk, 55, a North Shore Republican elected to the Senate in 2010, suffered a massive stroke in 2012 and spent almost a year in rehabilitation. 
 
 As he tries for a second six-year term in the Senate, Kirk has linked himself to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner as a financial and political protector. But that relationship can only go so far. Kirk already faced strong head winds in Democratic-dominated Illinois, including the coattails that could be provided if home state favorite Hillary Clinton wins her party's presidential nomination. 
 
 Kirk's comment also belie his attempts to sell himself to voters as a socially moderate Republican. 
 
 Tim Schneider, Illinois Republican Party chairman, described Kirk's comments as ""unfortunate,"" but said ""you have to consider the context."" 
 
 ""It was meant as an off-the-cuff remark between two colleagues, but … it was a hot mic,"" Schneider said. ""We know the senator is a great, hardworking advocate for the state of Illinois, and I think we all say something we regret. He regrets it and has apologized."" 
 
 Schneider reaffirmed the state's Republican Party support of Kirk's re-election bid. 
 
 In making the ""bro with no ho"" remark, Kirk was playing off recent comments from the South Carolina Republican about how his White House might look. Graham, 59, recently said publicly that his sister could be his first lady, or that one of his many friends could fill in. ""We'll have a rotating first lady,"" Graham said. 
 
 Kirk has been dogged by misstatements, exaggerations and controversial comments through much of his public life. Some of the questionable comments came after his 2012 stroke, but not all. 
 
 Kirk served in the House for nearly 10 years before beating Democrat Alexi Giannoulias in the contest for the Senate seat in 2010. Leading up to that victory, Kirk exaggerated his military record, his private-sector resume and his political accomplishments, claiming credit for the demise of the so-called Bridge to Nowhere planned for Alaska. 
 
 During the Senate campaign, Kirk apologized for inaccurate claims that he had come under enemy fire in Iraq, that he ran the Pentagon war room and that he was the Navy's intelligence officer of the year. It was Kirk's unit that won an award, not him individually. 
 
 Kirk retired from the Navy Reserve in May 2013. A 23-year veteran, he served as a naval intelligence officer and attained the rank of commander. 
 
 Kirk was criticized in 2013 for his call for the mass arrest of what he called the 18,000-strong Gangster Disciples. He later said he still supported mass arrests of gang members but that he used the 18,000 figure to shock Illinoisans into seeing the full extent of the state's gang issue. 
 
 Several months after his Gangster Disciples roundup idea, Kirk described a ride-along with Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood. Kirk said a ""guy got popped"" while they were on patrol. McCarthy later explained that it was a nonfatal, gang-related shooting in which the victim did not cooperate with police. 
 
 In another eyebrow-raising remark last December, Kirk reacted to a Senate committee report on harsh CIA interrogations by condemning Democratic committee staffers as ""little zombies"" reaching up from their ""political graves."" 
 
 In an interview this year with the Peoria Journal Star, Kirk said people drive faster through black neighborhoods. 
 
 ""With this state and all of its resources, we could sponsor a whole new class of potential innovators like George Washington Carver and eventually have a class of African-American billionaires,"" he told the newspaper. ""That would really adjust income differentials and make the diversity and outcome of the state much better so that the black community is not the one we drive faster through."" 
 
 His office later defended his commitment to African-Americans and said he was combating gang violence, trying to keep assault weapons off the street and working within the black community to find aspiring entrepreneurs. 
 
 Kirk also had to clarify his view on climate change after complaining that ""political correctness"" had taken over climate science and misidentifying Leif Eriksson as the discoverer of Greenland. Eriksson's father, Erik Thorvaldsson, founded the first European settlement on Greenland. ||||| Sen. Lindsey Graham says he’s not “defective” because he’s single. While he’s “been close once” to marrying a woman, he’s unsure why he never did so. And he said that if voters want a John F. Kennedy-esque clan in the White House, they should look elsewhere. 
 
 “If you are looking for Camelot, I’m not your guy,” Graham said in an interview. “If you’re looking for glitz and glamour, I’m probably the worst choice in the bunch. If you are looking for a determined person to be president, I think I can fill that bill.” 
 
 Story Continued Below 
 
 Since entering the race for the GOP nomination last week, the 59-year-old Graham has received his share of media coverage over his status as a bachelor, a rarity for a president. His personal life also has been the cause of quips in the back-slapping Senate, with the likes of Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk caught on mic Thursday, referring to Graham as a “bro with no ho.” Graham himself generated a flood of headlines this week when he suggested he would have a “rotating first lady” to fill the spot if he became president. 
 
 “Well, I’ve got a sister. She could play that role if necessary,” Graham said in an interview with Daily Mail Online published earlier this week. “I’ve got a lot of friends. We’ll have a rotating first lady.” 
 
 “It was a joke,” Graham told POLITICO. 
 
 A single president would be rare but not unprecedented. James Buchanan was a lifelong bachelor and the only president who never married, while Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson married while in office. 
 
 Graham’s single status has much to do with his complicated family life, his friends say. As a college student at the University of South Carolina, both of his parents died within 15 months when his sister, Darline, was barely a teenager. He returned home from school on the weekends to take care of her, later becoming his sister’s legal guardian as he entered the Air Force in 1982 so she could receive medical benefits. 
 
 “I’ve been close once early on, [as I was] taking care of my sister,” Graham said when asked why he never married. “It’s something I really don’t know the answer to, other than I think it’s OK. At the end of the day, there’s nothing wrong about not being married. Having a marriage and a good family and children is a blessing. But I don’t think I’m a defective person by any means.” 
 
 He added: “I don’t think there’s anything in the Constitution that says single people need not apply for president. And if it bothers some people, then they won’t vote for me. I offer what I offer.” 
 
 Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Graham’s best friend in the Senate, offered this assessment: “I know he’s dated some attractive women from time to time, but I’ve never seen him get real serious.” 
 
 McCain added with a big laugh: “I’ve often told Lindsey that he couldn’t find anybody that loves him as much as he does.” 
 
 Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) hugs is sister Darline Graham Nordone on stage as he announces his candidacy for United States President during an outdoor event for supporters on June 1, 2015 in Central, South Carolina. 
 
 How voters view a bachelor as a candidate is uncertain. Over the years, polls have shown that fewer U.S. adults are married, a trend that presidential historian Julian Zelizer said could mean “much less resistance” these days to a non-traditional candidate. 
 
 Not having a wife by his side could also rob Graham of a valuable surrogate on the campaign trail, as his rivals — like Rand Paul and Hillary Clinton — dispatch their spouses to rally supporters. But Graham said his sister, Darline Graham Nordone, who works in vocational rehabilitation in South Carolina and has two daughters, would fill that void. 
 
 “She’s played a big role in my life,” Graham said, growing emotional. “Yes, she’ll play a big role in the campaign. She’s my No. 1 fan. Of all the things I’m proud of, how she turned out I’m proud of the most.” 
 
 Even though he’s single and has no children, Graham says he has close family, including an aunt and uncle who took care of him and his sister after his parents died in the mid-1970s. 
 
 “You can be single and still have family,” Graham said. “I very much have family — my aunt and uncle, I try to take care of because they took care of me.” 
 
 “There are millions of people who are single. I don’t think they need to answer, ‘Why are you single?’” he added. “What they need to be able to prove is, ‘Can you do the job?’ … Again, I don’t think there’s anything disqualifying about being single. But that will be up to the American people.” ||||| WASHINGTON -- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is a “bro with no ho,” according to his colleague, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). 
 
 The assessment of Graham’s love life was made during a Senate Appropriations Committee markup on Thursday and caught on a live microphone. 
 
 Listen to Kirk's comments, which come around 0:26 in the below audio clip: 
 
 “I’ve been joking with Lindsey,” Kirk can be heard saying. “Did you see that? He’s going to have a rotating first lady. He’s a bro with no ho."" 
 
 Graham’s bachelorhood has been much-discussed since the launch of his presidential campaign. The senator is single with no children, which has raised questions about whether voters might find him unrelatable. Graham has laughed it off and even joked recently that he’ll have more than one first lady once he gets to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
 
 ""I feel real comfortable with who I am and the life I've lived,” Graham recently told The Huffington Post. “The last time I checked, I didn't see a sign on the White House that said 'single people need not apply.’” 
 
 But while he may lack a “ho,” it’s unclear whether Graham would describe himself as a “bro.” 
 
 Moreover, Kirk’s comment raises a number of questions: Are congressional bros different from everyday bros? Do they pop the collar on their pinstripe suits as they stroll through Dirksen in boat shoes? Do they hit the Senate gym each morning and play beer pong at Chuck Schumer’s apartment at night? Do they bring red plastic cups onto the Senate floor to sip on vodka-Red Bulls while they wait on roll call votes? 
 
 In a comment to HuffPost, Kirk’s office would only say that the senator was “joking around with his colleagues.” 
 
 But even before the publication of this piece, critics were pouncing. 
 
 ""I'm outraged,"" said HuffPost’s Laura Bassett, a self-described ""ho with no bro.""

He was referring to the focus on Graham running for president as a bachelor. “Senator Kirk was joking with his colleague and immediately apologized to anyone offended by his remark,"" says his press secretary.

 Screened in standard (non-IMAX) digital 3D. 
 
 Avatar has been described as a ""game-changer,"" and perhaps it is. I'll leave that for future historians to determine. What I can say with some assuredness is this is the most technically amazing motion picture to have arrived on screens in many years - perhaps since Peter Jackson's The Return of the King. It's also among the most anticipated openings of the decade. Expectations can be a double-edged sword; ask George Lucas. But when a filmmaker meets or exceeds them, the results are tremendous, and that's the case with Avatar. James Cameron has a lot riding on this film, his long-delayed follow-up to Titanic (which came out an even dozen years ago), the all-time box office champion in unadjusted dollars. Under ""normal"" circumstances, at stake would have been only Cameron's reputation and future autonomy with astronomical budgets. But Cameron has hitched his wagon to 3D and declared this to be the wave of the future. Watching Avatar, I can almost believe it. If every filmmaker could do with 3D what Cameron achieves, I'd gladly wear the uncomfortable glasses to every screening. 
 
 Avatar is entertainment of the highest order. It's the best movie of 2009. In 3D, it's immersive (that's the buzzword everyone uses for the 3D experience), but the traditional film elements - story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc. - are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2D version an engrossing 2 1/2-hour experience. Despite expending an extraordinary amount of time, money, and effort perfecting the 3D elements, Cameron never lost sight of what's important. His narrative could almost be considered a science fiction version of Dances with Wolves (by way of Surrogates), and it works for many of the reasons Dances worked. Cameron also borrows from his own catalog. The space/military culture is reminiscent of that in Aliens and the cross-cultural romance recalls Titanic. Avatar doesn't have Leonardo DiCaprio but its love story is in some ways more potent than the one told in Titanic because the stakes are higher. From a purely visual perspective, Cameron gives us one of the most amazing presentations ever of an alien world and builds toward an epic clash that may only have been matched twice previously in movie theaters (both times by Peter Jackson). 
 
 Avatar takes us to the planet Pandora in the year 2154. Pandora is a jungle world at which Earthmen have arrived with the intention of performing some strip-mining. Although corporations run the show, the military, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), is on hand to provide protection and lend support. The humans' engagements with the indigenous humanoid population, the 10-foot high, blue-skinned Na'vi, have been contentious, bordering on hostile. For a while, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) had some success interacting with the natives by using ""avatars""(synthetic Na'vi remotely controlled by humans) to provide education and technological advancement, but progress slowed and Grace was closed out of Na'vi society. Now, she and her group of avatars are trying to find a way back in. 
 
 That portal comes in the unlikely person of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine. Sam's journey to Pandora is a fluke. His twin brother, who had trained for years to inhabit an avatar and whose genetic identity was imprinted upon one, died unexpectedly and Jake was the only one who could take his place. He is caught between two masters: Colonel Quartich, who wants the soldier to form a bond with the Na'vi so he can pass back valuable tactical information, and Grace, who wants to rebuild the lines of communication. A series of events in the jungle separate Jake from the other avatars and place him in mortal danger. His life is saved by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), who distrusts him but believes he is touched by the Na'vi god. She takes him to the ""home tree"" where he must not only plead for his life but for the opportunity to learn their ways. Neytiri becomes his mentor and he soon finds himself more in sympathy with his blue-skinned ""brothers"" than with Colonel Quartich, who is planning a massive operation to relocate the Na'vi away from a rich load of ore. 
 
 Most 3D films use the technology as a gimmick - a means to prompt younger audience members to ""ooh"" and ""aah."" That's not the case here. Cameron's film is immersive because the 3D was ingrained in its cinematic DNA. He has compensated for the pervasive dimness caused by polarized lenses by increasing the brightness (the images look too bright when viewed without the glasses). He has avoided 3D ""tricks"" (throwing things at the audience) that might take the viewer out of the experience. Avatar's visuals are so sumptuous that, perhaps as little as ten minutes into the movie, I forgot I was wearing the glasses. I'm still not as bullish as Cameron about the future of 3D, but I see potential where I had not previously perceived it. 
 
 Cameron understands how the pieces of the puzzle need to come together to form a complete motion picture, and he assembles them as only a master can. The story, although simple, resonates deeply at a time when media battles rage about whether or not humanity is destroying itself and its planet. As with Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai, this is about a military man who finds himself transformed by the culture he adopts and ends up opposing his own people in an impossible battle. Jake's love affair with Neytiri confirms Cameron as being a romantic at heart. The Pandora menagerie is like something out of a dungeon master's wet dream: dinosaur-like creatures that are impervious to bullets, vicious carnivores that make T-Rexes look tame, scavengers that roam and attack in packs, dragon-like flying creatures that populate the skies, and vegetation that's just as alive as the animals. The blue-skinned Na'vi, clearly modeled after the Native Americans, are among the most ""ordinary"" of Pandora's inhabitants. 
 
 All movies like this must have a villain; Avatar provides two. The first is the bureaucrat, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), who is devoted to the profit margin above all else. Any resemblance to the Paul Reiser character in Aliens is intentional. Maybe Cameron was thinking of the studio bosses controlling his budget when he created Selfridge. Then there's Colonel Quartich, who is brought brilliantly to life by the scene-stealing performance of Stephen Lang. This man's a real sonofabitch, but it's impossible not to admire him on one level. Like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now, he loves the smell of napalm in the morning… at noon, and during the night. Quartich is never CGI animated but he always seems bigger than life. If there's a human star of Avatar, it's Lang. 
 
 Lang may have the showiest role but he's not the only actor to do a creditable job. Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver are both solid, even though a good portion of their characters' screen time is animated. Zoe Saldana is even more challenged, since she never appears ""in the flesh."" Like Andy Serkis' Gollum, she is entirely CGI-rendered, but she accomplished her own motion capture work and provided the voice. Michelle Rodriquez, like Stephen Lang, is never required to become blue. Her role is secondary but unambiguously heroic. Weaver's presence affirms that, as bad as Cameron's reputation as a taskmaster may be, there are actors who appreciate his perfectionist approach. (Others in this group include Michael Biehn, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Paxton, and Linda Hamilton.) 
 
 After the late summer 20-minute preview of Avatar, there was some unease about the look of the Na'vi. Such concerns are baseless. They can appear opposite humans without the special effects being called into question; we never view them as anything less than three-dimensional. Like Gollum, they transcend their pixel-based conception. We believe them. We accept them. We care about them. That's the key to Avatar being more than a hollow spectacle. In Transformers 2, everything (including the humans) is soulless. Here, there's heart and soul to spare. 
 
 Any criticisms I have of Avatar are in the nature of nit-picks, but I will mention them for completeness' sake. At worst, they are ephemeral distractions, easily dismissed. At best, they will not be noticed at all. Sam Worthington's performance is solid but his American accent is not. As was evident in Terminator: Salvation, Worthington's ""American"" sometimes comes with an Aussie twang. Visually, Avatar is almost flawless, but there are some instances when the camera moves so fast that the 3D effect doesn't track well, resulting in a brief moment of disorientation. Finally, although James Horner's score is predominantly effective, there are instances in which he again engages in self-cannibalization. Material sounding a lot like it originated in his often-used Star Trek II and Aliens scores pops up from time-to-time. 
 
 Avatar is the most engaging and enthralling motion picture I have experienced this year - and ""experience"" is the appropriate word. There's a rush associated with coming to Pandora; this feels more like an interactive endeavor than a passive one. In addition to being emotionally satisfying and one hell of a wild ride, Avatar boasts a smart script, reminding us that would-be blockbusters don't have to be defined by the imbecility of a Transformers 2 or a 2012. James Cameron has been entertaining movie-goers for more than a quarter century and he is in an elite category of filmmakers who has yet to spawn a dog. For quality like this, I'm willing to wait, although hopefully his next movie will come a little more quickly than the 12 years of Avatar's gestation.

 In the last shot of Avatar, someone's closed eyes snap open. That's the climax and the message of James Cameron's first fiction feature since 1997's Titanic: Look around! Embrace the movie  surely the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures  as a total sensory, sensuous, sensual experience. The planet Pandora that Cameron and his army of artist-technicians have created  at a budget believed to be in excess of $300 million  is a wonder world of flora and fauna: a rain forest (where it hardly ever rains) of gigantic trees and phosphorescent plants, of six-legged flying horses, panther dogs and hammerhead dinosaurs. Living among these creatures is Pandora's humanish tribe, the Na'vi, a lean, 10-ft.-tall, blue-striped people with yellow eyes, or what mankind might have been if it had evolved in harmony with, and not in opposition to, the Edenic environment that gave rise to its birth. (See 10 things you need to know for Avatar's opening day.) 
 
 It's the year 2154, and Pandora, a moon of the Alpha Centauri star, is the reluctant host to an expedition of Americans seeking to mine an incredibly valuable rock called unobtainium  a joke term that was coined in the 1950s and refers to any kind of material that's unavailable or impractical to use, which Cameron employs to locate his movie among science-fiction adventures of the period. The expedition, headed by sleazy entrepreneur Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), includes scientists working for Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and a Blackwater-type security force led by the malevolently macho Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). The scientists have hatched avatars (known as ""dreamwalkers"") that look like Na'vi but blend their DNA with that of humans, who will steer them by remote control. Augustine is entranced by the Na'vi's aristocratic gentility, but to Selfridge and Quaritch they are ""blue monkeys,"" ""savages,"" ""an aboriginal horde."" Or for want of a better word: disposable. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) 
 
 The new guy in this program is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington, last seen going up against machinery in Terminator Salvation), a paraplegic ex-Marine whose dead identical twin brother had been in the project. Since Sully has the same DNA, he's chosen to man his late brother's avatar. Augustine wants Sully to befriend the Na'vi and help her unearth precious biological samples; Quaritch orders him to become a secret spy, as part of the company's plan to drive the tribe away from a sacred tree, under which can be found vast reserves of unobtainium. In this double role, Sully meets Neyfiri (Zoe Saldana), daughter of the tribal chief. At first suspicious of his motives and contemptuous of his clumsiness  ""Ignorant, like a child,"" is the way she puts it  Neyfiri is nevertheless impressed by Sully's adaptability. Somehow he has an affinity for this place, for the Na'vi and for her. Someday he will be their savior. 
 
 For me to say that Avatar is better than Titanic is not the highest possible praise. I was no ardent fan of Cameron's grafting of a poor-boy/rich-girl love story onto the true saga of that doomed ship, which set sail from Southampton in 1912. But it was a night to remember for enough moviegoers, becoming the all-time top-grossing film, with a take of just over $1.8 billion (though it ranks sixth in real dollars, after Gone With the Wind, Star Wars, The Sound of Music, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial and the 1956 version of The Ten Commandments). What Cameron earned from Titanic's enormous success was the cachet (11 Oscars, tying the record with Ben-Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) and cash to make Avatar, which has been called the most expensive picture ever made (though, again in real dollars, that record is probably held by 1963's Cleopatra). That shouldn't matter to viewers. The democratizing principle of the box office is that moviegoers pay the same amount to see Avatar, in its 2-D form, as they do for Paranormal Activity, with its $11,000 budget. The only question they need have is: Is the movie worth it? (See TIME's 2009 holiday movie preview.) 
 
 I say yes, for Avatar is a state-of-the-art experience that for years to come will define what movies can achieve, not in duplicating our existence but in confecting new ones. The story may be familiar from countless old movies, from those made out of Hollywood like Dances With Wolves (an American grows sympathetic to the tribes he was meant to annihilate) and Apocalypse Now (and any number of anti-imperialist war epics) to those made abroad, like this year's District 9 (set in South Africa, where a human becomes part-alien and is hunted down by his old own kind). Some of the dialogue in Avatar's opening sequences may be on the starchy side  Cameron has never been a great director of actors nor sympathetic to their sensitive needs  but objections shrink to quibbles and then simply disappear in the face of the picture's unprecedented visual flourishes. (Read an interview with Avatar director James Cameron.) 
 
 Cameron has devised a romance similar to Titanic's  a grunt falls in love with a princess  but this time with far more emotive power. Instead of embracing on a ship's prow, Sully and Neyfiri ride their banshee steeds in ecstatic communion across the Pandoran sky. Think of them as the prince and princess of the world. Worthington  an Australian actor who had the second lead in the recent Terminator movie  has little of Titanic lead Leonardo DiCaprio's star power, but the resolve and good nature he radiates make Sully one of those ordinary heroes who rise to extraordinary heights. Saldana, though encased in CGI blue throughout the movie, manages to be the driving force: yet again in a Cameron film, we find a strong woman seeking a man whose strength she can tap. But unlike the tryst between DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, this love affair has consequences. It is not a footnote to history; it makes history, as two species merge to save a planet. (Read ""King of the [Blue] World."") 
 
 And by a planet, Cameron clearly means our planet. Among his activities in the dozen years since Titanic, the director made two underwater documentaries (Ghosts of the Abyss and Aliens of the Deep) that marked him as both an explorer and a conservationist. Avatar brings his social concerns to the surface. This is not only the most elaborate public-service commercial for those of the tree-hugger persuasion; it's also a call to save what we've got, environmentally, and leave indigenous people as they are  an argument applicable to the attempt of any nation (say, the U.S.) to colonize another land (say, Iraq or Afghanistan). The rooting interest in Avatar is for the Na'vi and against the American ex-soldiers whose job it is to police the planet. When some of them die in the battle that consumes the final third of this 2-hr. 42-min. extravaganza, you're meant to cheer. And you will. (Read about Avatar on Techland.) 
 
 That climactic face-off is stage-managed for maximum thrills, as the creatures we met in the first part of the film join the Na'vi in opposing the rotten humans. But the supreme joy of Avatar is in its long central portion: a safari through the luscious landscape of Pandora. After all those years on the water (with Titanic) and underwater (with The Abyss and his two documentaries), Cameron has surfaced to put his vision of Pandora on screen. It's an impossible but completely plausible and seductive world that invites your total immersion. Don't resist it; sink in and fly with it. All Cameron asks is that you open your eyes. 
 
 See the Top 10 James Cameron Moments. ||||| Two alternate titles come to mind when watching Avatar, the modest little indie by way of James ""King of the World"" Cameron: How about Runs With Na'vis, or Flies With Banshees? 
 
 The filmmaker's epic adventure - which cost upward of $230 million and, actually, happens to be great fun - is the gamer generation's answer to Dances With Wolves. It's a trippy sci-fi tale about an ex-Marine, trained to fight an indigenous people, who comes to understand the tribal culture in ways that make him terribly conflicted about annihilating them. 
 
 He falls in love, discovers their spiritual connection to nature, and finds himself at odds with his gung-ho superiors. 
 
 In Dances With Wolves (1990), it's Kevin Costner's U.S. Cavalry officer who insinuates himself into the world of the Lakota Sioux. In Avatar, it's Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a member of the ""Jarhead Clan,"" who learns the ways of the Na'vi - a blue-skinned, NBA-tall race of humanoids living in paradise on the planet Pandora. The Na'vi, who resemble buff, pointy-eared runway models, live in a lush rain forest teeming with exotic beasts, including those aforementioned banshees - flying reptile-like creatures that Na'vi warriors must bond with in a rite of passage. 
 
 And it's at that point in Cameron's two-hour, 41-minute marvel - when Sully's Na'vi avatar and his female friend Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) take to the air, astride winged banshees - that Cameron's long-borning baby really kicks in. It's like a runner hitting the Zone: All of a sudden, the movie, with its elaborate motion-capture technology (real actors' movements and gestures turned into computer-generated images), breaks into a new dimension - even if you're not watching in 3-D. (Avatar is being released in multiple formats: 3-D, Real-D, IMAX, and lowly, old-fashioned 2-D.) 
 
 Set in 2154, Avatar begins with Sully, who is paralyzed from the waist down (there have been military conflagrations in Nigeria and Venezuela, if you're keeping track), set to replace his dead twin brother in an avatar program on faraway Pandora. Climb into a pod, hook up the circuitry, and let your mind and body enter a Na'vi alter ego. 
 
 It's a last-ditch effort led by Dr. Grace Augustine (a butt-smokin' Sigourney Weaver) and her group of science nerds to befriend ""the indigenous"" with these human/Na'vi hybrids. If they fail, the private military force led by Col. Miles Quaritch (a cartoonish Stephen Lang), will start killing the Na'vi and defoliating their Eden. 
 
 Why? Because they're sitting on mounds of Unobtainium (sounds like something from Rocky and Bullwinkle!) - a mineral vital to Earth's energy needs. Giovanni Ribisi is the squirrelly industrialist overseeing the rape and pillage. 
 
 Avatar isn't deep: It has an obvious antiwar, tree-hugging message, and its characters are literally and figuratively archetypes. But Worthington, in both his human and Na'vi incarnations, makes the transition from warmonger to peacenik more than believable. One of Avatar's many brilliant strokes is to have its hero in a wheelchair: When his avatar-self starts running barefoot through the jungles, as agile as a cat, it's exhilarating and liberating - for both Sully and the audience. 
 
 (Early on in Dances With Wolves, Costner's Lt. Dunbar is in danger of having his leg amputated - go figure.) 
 
 Cameron is not a filmmaker to shy away from spectacle and the gizmos to deliver it. The first two Terminators, Aliens (with Weaver), The Abyss, and, of course, Titanic, all cost plenty, but with the exception of The Abyss, they sold more than enough tickets to make up for the expenditure. Whether Avatar recoups its outsize production and marketing outlays is a topic for the business wags to mull. 
 
 For the folks who plunk down their dollars (and pick up the plastic 3-D glasses), Avatar delivers. Combining beyond-state-of-the-art moviemaking with a tried-and-true storyline and a gamer-geek sensibility - not to mention a love angle, an otherworldly bestiary, and an arsenal of 22d-century weaponry - the movie quite simply rocks.

 Avatar Directed by James Cameron. With Joel Moore, Wes Studi, Michelle Rodriguez, Stephen Lang, CCH Pounder, Laz Alonso, Zoe Saldana, Giovanni Ribisi, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver. Distributed by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 2 hours, 40 minutes. Parent's guide: PG-13 (for intense epic battle sequences and warfare, sensuality, language and some smoking). ||||| Movie Review 
 
 With “Avatar” James Cameron has turned one man’s dream of the movies into a trippy joy ride about the end of life — our moviegoing life included — as we know it. Several decades in the dreaming and more than four years in the actual making, the movie is a song to the natural world that was largely produced with software, an Emersonian exploration of the invisible world of the spirit filled with Cameronian rock ’em, sock ’em pulpy action. Created to conquer hearts, minds, history books and box-office records, the movie — one of the most expensive in history, the jungle drums thump — is glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged. 
 
 The story behind the story, including a production budget estimated to top $230 million, and Mr. Cameron’s future-shock ambitions for the medium have already begun to settle into myth (a process partly driven by the publicity, certainly). Every filmmaker is something of a visionary, just by virtue of the medium. But Mr. Cameron, who directed the megamelodrama “Titanic” and, more notably, several of the most influential science-fiction films of the past few decades (“The Terminator,” “Aliens” and “The Abyss”), is a filmmaker whose ambitions transcend a single movie or mere stories to embrace cinema as an art, as a social experience and a shamanistic ritual, one still capable of producing the big WOW. 
 
 The scale of his new movie, which brings you into a meticulous and brilliantly colored alien world for a fast 2 hours 46 minutes, factors into that wow. Its scope is evident in an early scene on a spaceship (the year is 2154), where the passengers, including a paraplegic ex-Marine, Jake (Sam Worthington, a gruffly sensitive heartthrob), are being roused from a yearslong sleep before landing on a distant inhabited moon, Pandora. Jake is woken by an attendant floating in zero gravity, one of many such aides. As Jake himself glides through the bright cavernous space, you know you’re not in Kansas anymore, as someone soon quips (a nod to “The Wizard of Oz,” Mr. Cameron’s favorite film). You also know you’re not in the gloom of “The Matrix.” 
 
 Though it’s easy to pigeonhole Mr. Cameron as a gear head who’s more interested in cool tools (which here include 3-D), he is, with “Avatar,” also making a credible attempt to create a paradigm shift in science-fiction cinema. Since it was first released in 1999, “The Matrix,” which owes a large debt to Mr. Cameron’s own science-fiction films as well as the literary subgenre of cyberpunk, has hung heavily over both SF and action filmmaking. Most films that crib from “The Matrix” tend to borrow only its slo-mo death waltzes and leather fetishism, keeping its nihilism while ditching the intellectual inquiries. Although “Avatar” delivers a late kick to the gut that might be seen as nihilistic (and how!), it is strangely utopian. 
 
 It doesn’t take Jake long to feel the good vibes. Like Neo, the savior-hero of the “Matrix” series played by Keanu Reeves, Jake is himself an avatar because he’s both a special being and an embodiment of an idea, namely that of the hero’s journey. What initially makes Jake unusual is that he has been tapped to inhabit a part-alien, part-human body that he controls, like a puppeteer, from its head to its prehensile tail. Like the rest of the human visitors who’ve made camp on Pandora, he has signed on with a corporation that’s intent on extracting a valuable if mysterious substance from the moon called unobtainium, a great whatsit that is an emblem of humanity’s greed and folly. With his avatar, Jake will look just like one of the natives, the Na’vi, a new identity that gives the movie its plot turns and politics. 
 
 The first part of Jake’s voyage — for this is, above all, a boy’s rocking adventure, if one populated by the usual tough Cameron chicks — takes him from a wheelchair into a 10-foot, blue-skinned Na’vi body. At once familiar and pleasingly exotic, the humanoid Na’vi come with supermodel dimensions (slender hips, a miniature-apple rear); long articulated digits, the better to grip with; and the slanted eyes and twitchy ears of a cat. (The gently curved stripes that line their blue skin, the color of twilight, bring to mind the markings on mackerel tabby cats.) For Jake his avatar, which he hooks into through sensors while lying in a remote pod in a semiconscious state, is at first a giddy novelty and then a means to liberation. 
 
 Plugging into the avatar gives Jake an instant high, allowing him to run, leap and sift dirt through his toes, and freeing him from the constraints of his body. Although physically emancipated, he remains bound, contractually and existentially, to the base camp, where he works for the corporation’s top scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, amused and amusing), even while taking orders from its head of security, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a military man turned warrior for hire. A cartoon of masculinity, Quaritch strides around barking orders like some intransigent representation of American military might (or a bossy movie director). It’s a favorite Cameron type, and Mr. Lang, who until this year had long been grievously underemployed, tears into the role like a starved man gorging on steak. 
 
 Mr. Cameron lays out the fundamentals of the narrative efficiently, grabbing you at once with one eye-popping detail after another and on occasion almost losing you with some of the comically broad dialogue. He’s a masterly storyteller if a rather less nimble prose writer. (He has sole script credit: this is personal filmmaking on an industrial scale.) Some of the clunkier lines (“Yeah, who’s bad,” Jake taunts a rhinolike creature he encounters) seem to have been written to placate those members of the Michael Bay demographic who might find themselves squirming at the story’s touchier, feelier elements, its ardent environmentalism and sincere love story, all of which kick in once Jake meets Neytiri, a female Na’vi (Zoë Saldana, seen only in slinky Na’vi form). 
 
 Mr. Cameron has said that he started thinking about the alien universe that became Pandora and its galactic environs in “Avatar” back in the 1970s. He wrote a treatment in 1996, but the technologies he needed to turn his ideas into images didn’t exist until recently. New digital technologies gave him the necessary tools, including performance capture, which translates an actor’s physical movements into a computer-generated image (CGI). Until now, by far the most plausible character created in this manner has been slithery Gollum from Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” cycle. The exotic creatures in “Avatar,” which include an astonishment of undulating, flying, twitching and galloping organisms, don’t just crawl through the underbrush; they thunder and shriek, yip and hiss, pointy teeth gleaming. 
 
 The most important of these are the Na’vi, and while their movements can bring to mind old-fashioned stop-motion animation, their faces are a triumph of tech innovation, with tremors and twitches that make them immediately appealing and empathetic. By the time Neytiri ushers Jake into her world of wonders — a lush dreamscape filled with kaleidoscopic and bioluminescent flora and fauna, with pink jellyfishlike creatures that hang in the air and pleated orange flowers that snap shut like parasols — you are deep in the Na’vi-land. It’s a world that looks as if it had been created by someone who’s watched a lot of Jacques Cousteau television or, like Mr. Cameron, done a lot of diving. It’s also familiar because, like John Smith in “The New World,” Terrence Malick’s retelling of the Pocahontas story, Jake has discovered Eden. 
 
 An Eden in three dimensions, that is. In keeping with his maximalist tendencies, Mr. Cameron has shot “Avatar” in 3-D (because many theaters are not equipped to show 3-D, the movie will also be shown in the usual 2), an experiment that serves his material beautifully. This isn’t the 3-D of the 1950s or even contemporary films, those flicks that try to give you a virtual poke in the eye with flying spears. Rather Mr. Cameron uses 3-D to amplify the immersive experience of spectacle cinema. Instead of bringing you into the movie with the customary tricks, with a widescreen or even Imax image filled with sweeping landscapes and big action, he uses 3-D seemingly to close the space between the audience and the screen. He brings the movie to you. 
 
 After a few minutes the novelty of people and objects hovering above the row in front of you wears off, and you tend not to notice the 3-D, which speaks to the subtlety of its use and potential future applications. Mr. Cameron might like to play with high-tech gadgets, but he’s an old-fashioned filmmaker at heart, and he wants us to get as lost in his fictional paradise as Jake eventually does. On the face of it there might seem something absurd about a movie that asks you to thrill to a natural world made almost entirely out of zeroes and ones (and that feeds you an anticorporate line in a corporately financed entertainment). But one of the pleasures of the movies is that they transport us, as Neytiri does with Jake, into imaginary realms, into Eden and over the rainbow to Oz. 
 
 If the story of a paradise found and potentially lost feels resonant, it’s because “Avatar” is as much about our Earth as the universe that Mr. Cameron has invented. But the movie’s truer meaning is in the audacity of its filmmaking. 
 
 Few films return us to the lost world of our first cinematic experiences, to that magical moment when movies really were bigger than life (instead of iPhone size), if only because we were children. Movies rarely carry us away, few even try. They entertain and instruct and sometimes enlighten. Some attempt to overwhelm us, but their efforts are usually a matter of volume. What’s often missing is awe, something Mr. Cameron has, after an absence from Hollywood, returned to the screen with a vengeance. He hasn’t changed cinema, but with blue people and pink blooms he has confirmed its wonder. 
 
 “Avatar” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gun and explosive violence, death and despair.

110,"The South Dakota Department of Public Safety has decided to pull a public service campaign about safe driving because of concerns that it is a double entendre. 
 
 The campaign, “Don’t Jerk And Drive,” encouraged drivers to not jerk their steering wheel and over-correct while driving on icy roads. On the campaign’s Web site, it had sharable links reading “think before you jerk” and “jerking isn’t a joke,” which some saw as an innuendo for masturbation. Officials admitted to the Argus Leader the double meaning was intentional. 
 
 “I decided to pull the ad,” said Trevor Jones, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, in a statement. “This is an important safety message and I don’t want this innuendo to distract from our goal to save lives on the road.” 
 
 A video for the campaign is still available online. 
 
 “I think the intent clearly was … when you start to go off the road, you should take your foot off the gas and gently go back on,” state Rep. Mike Verchio (R) told the Argus Leader. “But it wasn’t defended very well that way. When they say ‘Yeah, there’s some double-meaning there,’ I think that was a terrible error in judgement.” ||||| Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology have solved a 70 year old mystery in traffic research: an until now inexplicable jerkiness when we steer a vehicle. The discovery may lead to safety systems in cars that can correct dangerous steering movements before they occur. 
 
 The ability to predict what a driver is going to do in the near future and to be able to prepare the car's system for this sounds a little bit like science fiction, and it would naturally be a dream come true for the safety departments at car manufacturers. The dream is now one step closer to becoming reality. 
 
 ""With the driver model I have developed, it is possible to predict what drivers are going to do with the steering wheel before they do it. It is possible to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, right when the person starts a wheel-turning movement. It's like looking into the future,"" says Chalmers researcher Ola Benderius. 
 
 As a result of the recently published discovery, several applications for car support systems can be developed to make our cars safer. Smarter anti-skid systems and systems for fatigued drivers are two examples of potential usage areas. 
 
 ""Imagine a fatigued driver on the verge of running off the road. He or she suddenly wakes up and reflexively initiates a very large corrective manoeuvre, a potential misjudgement that can lead to something very dangerous. Since we are now able to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, the vehicle's support systems can identify potential misjudgements and intervene, which means a serious accident, such as the car travelling into approaching traffic, can be avoided,"" says Ola Benderius. 
 
 What is the mystery that Ola Benderius has solved? As early as 1947, the well-known British researcher Arnold Tustin (1899-1994) produced the first model for how a person steers towards a target. He identified a continuous and linear control behaviour. When a car is driven, this corresponds to the driver gently and continuously following the road with the steering wheel. This behaviour is known as tracking within control theory, and it has been the prevailing theory for car driving ever since. However, when comparing the linear model with actual measured data, some deviations become apparent, namely jerkiness in the steering signal. 
 
 Tustin saw these deviations from the continuous prediction as well, but the mystery has remained unsolved until now. Ola Benderius and his colleague Gustav Markkula got the idea while they were attending a lecture on neurocognition at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The lecture addressed the behavioural theory of reaching, which concerns the basic human behaviour when we reach for something. 
 
 When studying how we humans move our hand from Point A to pick up something from Point B, the speed of the movement has a direct relationship with the distance - the longer the distance, the quicker the movement. The interesting effect of this is that the time for the movement is the same regardless of the distance. 
 
 ""We immediately recognised this pattern from our measured steer signals,"" says Ola Benderius. ""It was a bit of a eureka moment. Was it possible that this basic human behaviour also controlled how we steer a car?"" 
 
 With the idea in mind, Ola Benderius extracted over 1,000 hours of car and truck driving from real driving data, which resulted in 1.3 million steer corrections. It turned out that 95 per cent of these correspond with the reaching theory. Ola Benderius and Gustav Markkula had discovered that steering is not linear when the driver follows the road, but rather that the driver turns the wheel according to the special reaching pattern. 
 
 ""We were able to use the theory to explain what researchers had been trying to solve for a long time. This was the answer to the previously inexplicable jerkiness in the control signal. Rather than looking upon steering as continuously following the road, steering corrections seem to be applied in a very predetermined manner,"" says Ola Benderius. ""The control behaviour has also proven to be very natural; I saw this in an earlier study where I examined driving behaviour in 12 year olds and their parents."" 
 
 With this new knowledge, he was able to develop a mathematical model that can explain many observed steering behaviours, which means that the driver response to different situations can be predicted before it occurs. Ola Benderius believes the discovery will have an impact on an entire research field. 
 
 ""This might completely change how we regard human control of vehicles, crafts and vessels. I hope and believe that many researchers will utilise the findings and start to think in new ways. Control behaviour has traditionally been studied on the basis of control theory and technical systems. If it is instead studied on the basis of neuroscience with focus on the human, an entire new world opens up. This could push the research field in an entirely different direction,"" says Ola Benderius.

 Facts About the Research 
 
 The research has been conducted within the Adaptive systems research group at the Department of Applied Mechanics at Chalmers University of Technology. It has been financed by the Safer Vehicle and Traffic Safety Centre at Chalmers and the FFI research programme. 
 
 The discovery of the innate steering behaviour was recently published as a scientific paper, ""Evidence for a fundamental property of steering"": http://publications. lib. chalmers. se/ publication/ 205499-evidence-for-a-fundamental-property-of-steering","– ""Think before you jerk.” “Jerking isn’t a joke."" Such slogans, as reported in the Washington Post and elsewhere, garnered national attention when used to remind drivers in South Dakota not to over-correct their steering on slick roads. Indeed, the standard theory behind the way we steer our cars dates back to the 1940s but has left us with a longstanding mystery: data shows that we have a habit of jerking the wheel from time to time, puzzling researchers. Now, experts in Sweden are explaining the phenomenon, and their findings could lead to better safety systems in cars, according to a release at Eureka Alert. The jerkiness is tied to the way humans reach for things: When something is close by, we move our arms more slowly to grab it than we do when it's further away. The result is that both movements take the same amount of time. ""We immediately recognized this pattern"" as similar to steering behaviors, a researcher says. ""It was a bit of a eureka moment. Was it possible that this basic human behavior also controlled how we steer a car?"" A study of more than 1,000 hours of drivers' movements suggests that it certainly was. The team developed a mathematical model addressing the behavior; now, ""it is possible to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, right when the person starts a wheel-turning movement. It's like looking into the future,"" the researcher says. That could improve safety: For instance, if a sleepy driver is edging off the road, his car's support system could predict how much he's going to jerk the wheel to try to correct things, often disastrously, and intervene to prevent it.

111,"Twenty years ago this December, James Cameron’s Titanic sailed into theaters. It was made for a then-record breaking $210 million, and proceeded to break more records at the box office with a haul that has grossed over $2 billion. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and ended up collecting 11 overall, including for best picture and director for Cameron. Audiences went home with tears in their eyes and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s Jack and Rose in their hearts. 
 
 Time to bring out the tissues again. Cameron has recently remastered his classic, and Titanic will return to theaters beginning December 1, this time in a laser-projected Dolby Vision format the filmmaker hopes will see wider industry adoption. Ahead of that re-release, on Sunday, the National Geographic Channel will air the documentary Titanic: 20 Years Later with James Cameron. 
 
 Cameron spoke with Vanity Fair recently about some of Titanic’s unanswered questions, what a sale of the 20th Century Fox movie studio would mean for him, and how his work on the Avatar and Terminator franchises is progressing. 
 
 Vanity Fair: Do you think any movie studio in 2017 would greenlight a movie like Titanic today? 
 
 James Cameron: They’re greenlighting movies twice that expensive. 
 
 But different ones. 
 
 It was a very peculiar set of circumstances that even got that film greenlit in the first place. It was an anomaly and of course I’m lucky and grateful that it happened. But I don’t think the industry has changed that much in 20 years when it comes to risk aversion. They were risk averse then, and they’re risk averse now. And all the trends everybody’s always talking about, “Oh, well it’s only franchises, it’s only comic books.” You know what? It was that stuff back then. It’s not like we’re getting any smarter. 
 
 Kate Winslet has a role in one of the Avatar sequels, which you’ve said partly take place underwater. Can you tell me about it? 
 
 She does, and she’s very excited about it. She blazed through for a couple of days of rehearsals and saw the world that we had created, and how we do the work, and she’s very excited. She plays a character who’s part of the Sea People, the reef people. The one thing she did do is demand that she do all her own water work. I said, “All right, that’s fine, we’ll have to teach you how to free dive.” The other actors are up to three- and four-minute breath holds. We’ve already been doing underwater capture. We did a scene last week with six teenagers, well, actually five teenagers and one 7-year-old underwater holding their breath for a couple minutes and acting, actually doing a dialogue scene under water because they speak kind of a sign language. 
 
 One question that people ask me a lot about Titanic, and I’m assuming they ask you this a lot, is at the end, why doesn’t Rose make room for Jack on the door? 
 
 And the answer is very simple because it says on page 147 [of the script] that Jack dies. Very simple. . . . Obviously it was an artistic choice, the thing was just big enough to hold her, and not big enough to hold him . . . I think it’s all kind of silly, really, that we’re having this discussion 20 years later. But it does show that the film was effective in making Jack so endearing to the audience that it hurts them to see him die. Had he lived, the ending of the film would have been meaningless. . . . The film is about death and separation; he had to die. So whether it was that, or whether a smoke stack fell on him, he was going down. It’s called art, things happen for artistic reasons, not for physics reasons. 
 
 Well, you’re usually such a stickler for physics . . . 
 
 I am. I was in the water with the piece of wood putting people on it for about two days getting it exactly buoyant enough so that it would support one person with full free-board, meaning that she wasn’t immersed at all in the 28 degree water so that she could survive the three hours it took until the rescue ship got there. [Jack] didn’t know that she was gonna get picked up by a lifeboat an hour later; he was dead anyway. And we very, very finely tuned it to be exactly what you see in the movie because I believed at the time, and still do, that that’s what it would have taken for one person to survive.

 Given the nudity and violence, how did Titanic end up with a PG-13 rating? Did you have to make a case to the M.P.A.A. for it? 
 
 Maybe it’s the haze of time, but I don’t recall it being controversial. When we submitted it we did say that the nudity was artistic and not erotic. And I guess they bought that. And at the time, I think their standard for a small amount of frontal nudity above the waist was more relaxed than it is now. Which is a little bizarre, but there you have it. 
 
 What do you remember from the night Titanic won the Oscars? 
 
 I remember almost getting in a fight with Harvey Weinstein and hitting him with my Oscar. 
 
 In retrospect there are probably a lot of people . . . 
 
 That would’ve preferred I had played through on that one. . . . It was happening on the main floor at the [theater] . . . And the music had started to play to get back in our seats. The people around us were saying, “Not here! Not here!” Like it was O.K. to fight in the parking lot, you know, but it was not O.K. there when the music was playing, and they were about to go live. 
 
 What were you and Harvey discussing that led to this altercation? 
 
 It’s kind of a long story, but it has to do with Guillermo del Toro and how badly he was dealt with by Miramax on Mimic. Harvey came up glad-handing me, talking about how great they were for the artist, and I just read him chapter and verse about how great I thought he was for the artist based on my friend’s experience, and that led to an altercation. 
 
 You made Titanic for 20th Century Fox, which has been your longtime studio home. And you’re making the Avatar sequels for them, but there are reports now that the Murdochs are interested in selling the movie studio. What would that mean for you and your films? 
 
 Probably not that much. I’ve always had a good relationship with Fox. If they sold to Disney that wouldn’t be bad because Disney actually at this point in time has a bigger investment in Avatar than Fox does in terms of spent money. 
 
 Because of the Pandora—The World of Avatar themed land at Disney World? 
 
 Yeah, exactly. So I get along great with Fox; I’m sure I’d get along great with Disney. 
 
 With all of the work going into the Avatar sequels there have been some delays in getting started. 
 
 I wouldn’t call them delays. It was highly optimistic that we could start quickly until scripts are written. If there’s no scripts, there’s nothing, right? The scripts took four years. You can call that a delay, but it’s not really a delay because from the time we pushed the button to really go make the movies [until now,] we’re clicking along perfectly. We’re doing very well because of all the time that we had to develop the system and the pipeline and all that. We weren’t wasting time, we were putting it into tech development and design. So when all the scripts were approved, everything was designed. Every character, every creature, every setting. In a funny way it was to the benefit of the film because the design team had more time to work. . . . Most of the actors, the key principals, have all read all four scripts, so they know exactly what their character arcs are, they know where they’re going, they know how to modulate their arc now across the first two films. We all know where we’re supposed to be dramatically in the saga, and that’s great. Let’s face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don’t make enough money, there’s not going to be a 4 and 5. They’re fully encapsulated stories in and of themselves. It builds across the five films to a greater kind of meta narrative, but they’re fully formed films in their own right, unlike, say, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where you really just had to sort of go, “Oh, shit, all right, well I guess I better come back next year.” Even though that all worked and everybody did.

 Will the Avatar sequels deal with some of the similar themes you addressed in the first film, in particular, the environment? 
 
 It will be a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you’re gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you’re probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and you said later you hated it, you’re probably gonna love these. 
 
 And the Terminator film, how is that going? 
 
 We’re cranking along. . . . It’s the first of three, the story is mapped out over a three-film arc, but again, if we don’t make any money there isn’t gonna be a two and a three. Technically, we’re thinking of them as three, four, and five. As if Terminator, and Terminator 2 exist, and the other ones are kind of alternate time lines that are no longer relevant. 
 
 What made you want to return to that world? 
 
 I just feel like the world we live in now is going to be very much defined by our co-evolution with our technology. While technology and innovation have this vast promise for our survival, it’s also an enormous threat, especially when it comes to strong [artificial intelligence] being coupled with weaponized robotics, and that’s all coming. It’s just a question of who gets there first, it’s gonna be the next big arms race, it’s gonna be like the next race to get the bomb . . . And when you couple that with the kind of wired world that we live in, where we’ve basically given away our privacy and every single person walking around that’s got a smartphone is essentially a belled cat—a walking sensor platform that can be monitored from afar—it’s like we’re really on the cusp of an Orwellian Armageddon of inconceivable proportions. Therefore, I thought, hey, let’s make a movie about that. So it’s going to be a very cheerful and upbeat kind of film. 
 
 When Titanic hits theaters again in December, will you go see it? 
 
 Yeah, I want to see it in its entirety. I want to bring family and friends to see it in HDR. . . . Seeing a film that everybody knows, but seeing it in HDR in 3-D with proper light levels on a Dolby Vision laser projector—it’s really a glimpse of the future. . . . We had the whole film remastered in HDR, and it’s stunning. It’s beyond 70 millimeter, it’s beyond any format that you’ve seen before. What we’re trying to do is get Paramount and Fox to support the rollout of the Dolby Vision cinema project. It occurred to me, hey, we’ve got a movie that’s an evergreen that people love, why don’t we slam it into theaters and let people see it, not in a way it should be seen, but a way far beyond what any movie looks like right now, other than some new films are being authored in HDR? Obviously the [new] Avatar films will be [in Dolby Vision] as well, and in fact, we’re also going to do a conversion of Avatar to HDR. We’ll re-release that at some point down the line; I want to try to help this rollout of the Dolby cinemas, because I think it’s fantastic what they’re doing. ||||| Rose had to let go. 
 
 Two decades after the Titanic sank on the big screen, director James Cameron is still defending one of Hollywood’s most heartbreaking movie deaths. 
 
 After joking to Vanity Fair that Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) froze to death hanging off a wooden plank clearly big enough for him and Rose (Kate Winslet) happened “because it says on page 147 (of the script) that Jack dies,�? Cameron called the decision “an artistic choice.�? 
 
 “I think it’s all kind of silly, really, that we’re having this discussion 20 years later. But it does show that the film was effective in making Jack so endearing to the audience that it hurts them to see him die. Had he lived, the ending of the film would have been meaningless,�? he told the magazine.

 Republican candidate for president Herman Cain makes an appearance at the iconic Cuban restaurant 'Versailles' in the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami, Florida November 16, 2011. 
 
 MIAMI Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain sipped Cuban-style coffee and tossed out a few Spanish words during a sweaty rally in the heart of Miami's Cuban exile community on Wednesday, but made only one vague reference to Florida's communist Caribbean neighbor. 
 
 The former pizza company executive laid out his plan for reviving the American economy during the rally in the parking lot of the Versailles restaurant in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. 
 
 ""What about freedom for Cuba?"" a man in the crowd shouted. 
 
 ""Freedom for Cuba now!"" Cain replied and went back to outlining his plan to boost U.S. job creation. 
 
 He said he would throw out the current tax code and ""Pass a new structure called 'nueve, nueve, nueve',"" the Spanish numbers for his signature 9-9-9 tax proposal to levy a flat 9 percent corporate, income and sales tax. 
 
 Cain led the polls for a while among candidates vying for the Republican nomination to challenge President Barack Obama in the November 2012 presidential election. His popularity has slipped recently amid sexual harassment allegations from several women, which he has denied. 
 
 The Versailles restaurant is the de facto headquarters of Miami's Cuban exile community and a required stop for anyone seeking votes among conservative Republican Cuban-Americans. 
 
 Following the familiar drill, Cain stepped up to the carry-out window to sample Cuban-style coffee, served strong and syrupy sweet in a tiny cup. Offered a 'croqueta,' a deep fried stick of minced ham and bread crumbs, he took one bite and laid it back on the counter. 
 
 ""I am thrilled to be here at this wonderful restaurant Versailles and I did taste that wonderful Cuban coffee and a croqueta. It was delicious,"" he told the crowd a few minutes later. ""Gracias, gracias, gracias,"" he thanked them. 
 
 A typical candidate visit to Versailles includes a denunciation of Cuba's communist government and some harsh criticism of leaders Fidel and Raul Castro, but Cain broke with tradition and omitted any specific condemnation. 
 
 ""A LEADER DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING"" 
 
 The former radio talk show host, who appeared flustered and uncertain when asked a routine question about Libya last week, made no mention of any foreign policy. 
 
 ""I'm often criticized ... criticized about the fact that I don't know this and I don't know that, and I don't know that and I don't know this,"" he told the crowd. ""A leader doesn't have to know everything."" 
 
 As a leader, he said, he would surround himself with good people and ""I'll get them to put together the right plan."" 
 
 Cain stopped several times to mop his brow as the midday sun beat down on the palm-tree-flanked stage on the asphalt parking lot. He said he understood hard work and ""sweat equity,"" prompting several in the crowd to shout back ""We're sweating now."" 
 
 ""We're sweating now!"" Cain took up the cry. 
 
 One woman at the restaurant asked who Cain was, then walked away in a huff when it became clear the counter staff was too distracted to fulfill her pastry order. 
 
 But another middle-aged woman gave him a tight hug and declared, ""I love you"" as Cain walked through the restaurant. 
 
 ""He has my same philosophy, he's a true conservative,"" said the woman, Fanny Roca. She said she did not believe the sexual harassment allegations against him and thought they were part of a media attempt to smear Cain as his campaign took off. 
 
 ""They waited until he came at the top of the polls to say it. Why?"" she asked.

 “How do you say delicious in Cuban?” he asked during a campaign stop in Miami’s Little Havana. 
 
 “Delicioso,” a man replied.

113,"David S. Broder, 81, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post and one of the most respected writers on national politics for four decades, died Wednesday at Capital Hospice in Arlington of complications from diabetes. 
 
 Mr. Broder was often called the dean of the Washington press corps - a nickname he earned in his late 30s in part for the clarity of his political analysis and the influence he wielded as a perceptive thinker on political trends in his books, articles and television appearances. 
 
 In 1973, Mr. Broder and The Post each won Pulitzers for coverage of the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon's resignation. Mr. Broder's citation was for explaining the importance of the Watergate fallout in a clear, compelling way. 
 
 As passionate about baseball as he was about politics, he likened Nixon's political career to an often-traded pitcher who had ""bounced around his league."" 
 
 He covered every presidential convention since 1956 and was widely regarded as the political journalist with the best-informed contacts, from the lowliest precinct to the highest rungs of government. 
 
 Former Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee called Mr. Broder ""the best political correspondent in America. David knew politics from the back room up - the mechanics of politics, the county and state chairmen - whereas most Washington reporters knew it at the Washington level."" 
 
 Mr. Broder was praised at the highest echelons of political power. The White House issued a statement from President Obama that called him a ""true giant of journalism"" and added that he ""built a well-deserved reputation as the most respected and incisive political commentator of his generation."" 
 
 Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said in a statement, ""In his thoughtful and probing questions based on decades of scholarship and on-the-scene observations, David Broder set the modern 'gold standard' for those of us engaged in political life as we sought to persuade others, to legislate and to administer the successful progress of our country."" 
 
 Asking tough questions 
 
 
 
 Balding, sporting horn-rimmed glasses and measured in his speaking style, Mr. Broder was once likened to an MIT professor in appearance. He was a frequent and instantly recognizable panelist on TV news-discussion shows, a penetrating questioner who often put politicians on the spot and a clear-eyed analyst who could cut to the heart of an issue. 
 
 On ""Meet the Press"" in 1987, he probed whether then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, the GOP front-runner in the next year's White House race, was too much an Eastern patrician to understand average Americans. 
 
 Mr. Broder asked the candidate whether he knew how many Americans lacked health insurance and how many U.S. children were born into poverty. 
 
 Bush said he didn't know, adding: ""We have the best medical-attention system in the world, and I don't want to see it go into the mode of England or this whole concept of socialized medicine where the government provides absolutely everything. You are going to break the government."" ||||| Having grown up in the Chicago area, rooting for years for the luckless Cubs and more recently for the hapless Washington Nationals, I feel particularly qualified to comment on the Obama administration's struggles to find a useful role to play in the crisis racking Egypt and the wider Arab world, let alone the blizzards in the Midwest and New England. 
 
 I know that sports analogies - as well as weather anecdotes from one's youth - are dangerous and sometimes misleading. But in this case, they are irresistible. 
 
 The simple fact is that there is little Washington can do about the impact of successive years of terrible winter weather or the upheaval in Cairo, which threatens America's interests in the Middle East. 
 
 Let's deal with the latter first. America has a long history in Egypt - too long a history. It goes back to King Farouk, a name that means nothing to many people these days. Nobody younger than my generation can summon a mental picture of the chain-smoking playboy emperor of Cairo. But he was our man for a time in the early 1950s, and the Egyptian people have neither forgotten nor forgiven. 
 
 We did business with Egypt because of our interest in the Suez Canal, the vital waterway where much of the world's oil supply is transported from the Persian Gulf. That interest was so great that President Dwight D. Eisenhower rebuffed two of our staunchest allies, Britain and France, when they decided to try to wrest control of the canal from Egypt. 
 
 This made us briefly popular with the people in Cairo, but it did not last. Subsequent leaders who supported us, culminating in Hosni Mubarak, have been increasingly unpopular with their own populace. 
 
 Which brings me back to my analogy. 
 
 As a Cubs fan and more recently a Nationals supporter, I am accustomed to spending Septembers reading about other teams' pursuit of the World Series. Whether it is the Red Sox fending off the Yankees, or the Giants five months ago trying to gain entry for the first time since the 1989 earthquake, those who share my history have learned that it's no fun watching other teams at such historic events. 
 
 You know that something big is happening and that it will inevitably affect you. But you don't know whom to root for, and ultimately you realize that events will unfold and you have almost no influence on the outcome. 
 
 That is the reality that confronts President Obama today. His hands are tied while Egypt erupts. 
 
 At first he expressed support and sympathy for the democratic forces filling the streets and appreciation for the Egyptian military holding fire. But when it became clear that Mubarak was on his way out, sooner or later, it dawned on everyone that the Muslim Brotherhood might seize on the resulting power vacuum and chaos to erect a hostile regime on the banks of the Suez Canal. 
 
 Whom do you root for in a situation like this? 
 
 I turn with relief to the weather. Washington was shut down by snow for a whole workweek last winter because we have no capacity to deal with even a few flakes. Aside from one nightmare evening recently, this year we have been spared. But seeing the photographs of hundreds of cars and buses stranded on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago on Tuesday evening brought back memories of other blizzards that made it an adventure even to cross the Midway from Burton-Judson Courts to Cobb Hall for a history class at the University of Chicago. 
 
 I have so often driven Lake Shore Drive, either to its exit on Sheridan Road or partway north to Addison, where all roads lead to the Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field, that I could feel for the drivers and passengers who could not reach the nearest exit ramp because of all the stalled vehicles. Lake Shore Drive, better known as the Outer Drive, terminated at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, whose pristine beach was rarely populated by its elderly residents. But it stopped traffic from going straight into Evanston, the home of the two most elitist institutions in the area, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Northwestern University, even when there was no blizzard raging. On Tuesday you couldn't even get to the Edgewater. 
 
 There was nothing you could do about it. Just like the United States in Egypt.

114,"Donald Trump named Donald F. McGahn as White House counsel, selecting a seasoned political lawyer who could help navigate the growing scrutiny on potential conflicts of interest between the president-elect’s businesses and his incoming administration. 
 
 McGahn, a partner at the Jones Day law firm in Washington and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, had served as an adviser to Trump’s campaign. His specialties include government ethics, the president-elect’s transition team said in a statement Friday announcing his selection.

 “Don has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law,” Trump said in the statement. “He will play a critical role in our administration.” 
 
 Even before Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, McGahn will be tasked with helping the real-estate developer navigate an extensive web of business ties and commercial interests that stand as potential conflicts of interest. Trump’s licensing deals and other businesses have drawn renewed scrutiny since he was elected president on Nov. 8, yet he said this week in an interview with the New York Times that as a sitting U.S. president, he “can’t have a conflict of interest.” 
 
 Executive Orders 
 
 The White House counsel is also responsible for preparing executive orders issued by the president, ensuring that they are constitutional. Trump has pledged to rescind many of President Barack Obama’s orders, saying they exceeded his powers, while vowing to issue his own on issues such as restricting immigration from countries compromised by Islamic terrorists. 
 
 Trump is in Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday. Transition officials said on a conference call Friday that he’ll meet in New York on Nov. 28 with former BB&T Corp. Chief Executive Officer John Allison, who’s said to be a contender for Treasury Secretary, and with former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Paul Atkins. 
 
 In addition to McGahn’s selection, the transition team announced that Kathleen Troia “KT” McFarland was named deputy national security adviser. Neither of the two positions filled on Friday requires confirmation by the Senate.

 McFarland, 65, has a long record of national security experience, serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the early 1980s under President Ronald Reagan. McFarland also has worked as a national security analyst and a contributor to Fox News. She ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in New York in 2006. 
 
 Obama Critic 
 
 “I am proud that KT has once again decided to serve our country and join my national security team,” Trump said in a statement. “She has tremendous experience and innate talent that will complement the fantastic team we are assembling, which is crucial because nothing is more important than keeping our people safe.” 
 
 McFarland would report to retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was named Trump’s national security adviser last week. She has praised Trump for his instincts, saying they make up for his lack of experience in government and national security. 
 
 “Foreign policy, national security, defense is not the president-elect’s skill,” she said last week on Fox News. “He didn’t come into the job with a lot of experience and background in it but in talking about the issues, he gets right to the core.” 
 
 ‘It’s Chaos’ 
 
 McFarland worked as an aide to then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. She helped write a groundbreaking speech in 1984 by then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger that described U.S. policy on use of military force under Reagan and later became known as the Weinberger Doctrine. 
 
 In recent years, she has been critical of the Obama administration’s approach to foreign policy, accusing the president of a weak approach to terrorism and other global threats. 
 
 “The alternative to American leadership in the world is not some kumbaya world peace, global world order, like Obama says,” she said last year on the Fox Business Network. “It’s chaos, or it’s dictatorship.” 
 
 Praise for Putin 
 
 In 2013, after Obama opted against a military strike against the Syrian government’s chemical weapons stockpiles, McFarland wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin deserved the credit for using diplomacy to stave off the attack. In a deal between the U.S., Russia and the Syrian government, chemical material was shipped out of Syria in 2014. 
 
 “The world knows that Vladimir Putin is the one who really deserves that Nobel Peace Prize,” she wrote on FoxNews.com in September of 2013. “It turns out that leading from behind left a big opening up front. Putin stepped right in. And Obama still hasn’t figured it out.” 
 
 After extremists in Paris killed 130 people last January, McFarland called for stricter counterterrorism policies in the U.S., including “terrorist profiling.” 
 
 “We need to take a different approach to fighting terrorism than the one-size-fits-all, politically correct policy we have had in place for over a decade,” she wrote on FoxNews.com last year. 
 
 McGahn at FEC 
 
 McGahn served as a member of the Federal Election Commission, charged with overseeing the nation’s election laws, from 2008 to 2013. Those laws underwent dramatic changes after the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which allowed corporations to spend unlimited sums on political speech. That resulted in groups known as super-PACs raising millions from deep-pocketed donors. 
 
 McGahn oversaw a major rewrite of the FEC’s procedures, which he has said brought unprecedented transparency and due process to the agency. Critics say that instead he placed too much power in the hands of the often deadlocked commissioners -- there are six, three from each party, who often split on partisan lines -- while hamstringing its career staff, limiting its effectiveness. 
 
 “McGahn ran a one-man agency nullification program,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign-finance watchdog. “He rejected core parts of the FEC’s enforcement mandate and successfully employed obstructionism over good faith negotiations with his fellow commissioners.” 
 
 Before his stint at the FEC, McGahn served as general counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party committee for GOP House members, for almost a decade.

 On the conflict questions McGahn will face at the White House, Trump told the Times that he was in the process of extricating himself from his business relationships, and would have his oldest children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, take over the management of his businesses. Yet the interview, in which Trump said he was surprised to learn there were no laws requiring him to transfer assets to a blind trust, raised more questions over how he’ll handle his business empire after taking office. 
 
 Recent media reports singled out the president-elect’s links to a Philippine developer who has been appointed that nation’s envoy to the U.S.; disclosed that Trump took a break from transition planning to meet with three business partners building Trump-branded towers in India; and said that Ivanka Trump sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ||||| WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump filled two lower-profile but influential White House staff jobs on Friday, while his high-profile candidate for secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, continued to deliberate about whether to join the administration. 
 
 Mr. Trump offered the housing job this week to Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon who challenged him for the Republican presidential nomination. But despite expectations of a Friday announcement, Mr. Carson was “still pondering,” said a friend, Armstrong Williams. The president-elect’s aides said Mr. Trump did not plan any more cabinet-level announcements until next week. 
 
 For the politically sensitive post of White House counsel, Mr. Trump chose Donald F. McGahn II, a Washington election lawyer who pushed to deregulate campaign finance and election laws. The counsel’s job may be even more daunting than it was in previous administrations, given Mr. Trump’s far-flung business empire, with which he shows no inclination toward severing ties. 
 
 For the equally critical job of deputy national security adviser, Mr. Trump chose K. T. McFarland, an aide in three Republican White Houses and a Fox News commentator. She has been highly critical of President Obama’s approach to combating terrorism — a view that aligns her with Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn. ||||| Story highlights McFarland will be the Deputy National Security Advisor

 Wearing a cozy white outfit, the photo gives the world the first glimpse of Louis’ bright eyes and dark hair, proving he is already taking after his big sister (big brother Prince George was born with blonde hair). 
 
 Both photos were taken by Kate at the family’s home at Kensington Palace. 
 
 The release of the photos comes as a surprise, as the royal parents usually share their children’s first portraits about a month after their births.

 “Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank members of the public for all of the kind messages they have received following the birth of Prince Louis, and for Princess Charlotte’s third birthday,” Kensington Palace announced. 
 
 Kate, who studied art history at the University of St. Andrews, is a keen photographer and regularly shares photos she’s taken of her royal children. From birthday shots to first day of school moments, the royal mom of three can usually be found behind the camera capturing her family’s special memories. 
 
 The sweet shot of Charlotte and Louis is part of a family tradition. The photo is very similar to the portraits Kate took of a then one-month-old Princess Charlotte with big brother Prince George in June 2015.

 The royal parents took the same low-key route for the siblings’ first photos together with Kate as the photographer. She even got little George to plant a sweet kiss on his sister’s head in one of the shots. The photos were also taken in a familiar place — the couple’s country home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk, England.

 In the three-minute YouTube video uploaded Wednesday by LaVoy Finicum, one of the men responsible for leading the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns since Jan. 2, Finicum and several other men are shown leafing through boxes of documents belonging to the Paiute tribe. 
 
 Finicum encourages tribe members to meet with the militia group to reclaim items ""rotting"" and ""wasting away"" at the government refuge, which is home to thousands of Paiute artifacts, including tools and weapons, as well as burial grounds. In the video, Finicum notes decades-old papers strewn across the floor, and one box allegedly containing a rat's nest. 
 
 ""We are concerned about the way artifacts are stored here, the Paiute's artifacts, and so we're reaching out to the Paiute tribe to say we need to open up a communication,"" Finicum said. ""We want to make sure that these things are returned to their rightful owners and that they're taken care of."" 
 
 Despite the militiamen's assertion that they intend to save Paiute artifacts from the government, tribe members argue it is the militiamen that their belongings need protecting from. In a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week, the tribe requested assistance in protecting Paiute artifacts from the armed protesters, calling for an inventory of items in the refuge, and criminal prosecution of the group under the Archeological Resources Protection Act.

 ""They continue to desecrate one of our most important sacred sites,"" Burns Paiute Tribal Chair Charlotte Rodrique said in a news release. ""They should be held accountable."" 
 
 Also contrary to the militia group's mission to transfer control of public land from the federal government to ranchers, the Paiute argue the refuge land is a part of the tribe's ancestral territory and have refused to meet with the group. 
 
 Other members of the community surrounding the wildlife refuge have also denounced the actions of the militia members, many of whom are not from Oregon. Harney County Judge Steve Grasty said he plans to hold leader Ammon Bundy—son of notorious Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy— responsible for the cost of providing security measures for the refuge, a bill that could be as high as $70,000 a day.

 In total, the standoff has cost taxpayers nearly a half million dollars, according to Oregon Gov. Kate Brown. In letters to the White House and Department of Justice this week, Brown requested assistance from the FBI and other law enforcement in removing the militia group from federal land, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. 
 
 ""For the citizens of Harney County and indeed all Oregonians, I must insist on a swift resolution to this matter,"" Brown wrote. ""Efforts to negotiate have not been successful, and now it is unclear what steps, if any, federal authorities might take to bring this untenable situation to an end and restore normalcy to this community."" ||||| Standoff leader posted a video of him looking through artifacts and documents from the Paiute tribe at the Malheur national wildlife refuge, sparking outrage 
 
 The militiamen stationed at a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon are now rummaging through artifacts and documents of the Paiute tribe, sparking outrage among local Native Americans whose ancestors originally occupied the land. 
 
 LaVoy Finicum, one of the leaders of the armed protesters occupying the Malheur national wildlife refuge, posted a video of himself inside a government building looking through cardboard boxes of papers and other items associated with the local tribe – and inviting Paiute leaders to meet with the militia and reclaim their belongings. 
 
 “We want to make sure these things are returned to their rightful owner,” said Finicum, who recently helped destroy a US Fish and Wildlife Service fence and remove cameras that he claimed the government was using for surveillance. 
 
 The rightwing militia, led by Ammon Bundy, took over the headquarters of the wildlife sanctuary on 2 January to protest the government’s land-use regulations in rural Harney County. They have demanded that local ranchers have control of public lands – not the federal government. 
 
 But days after the occupation began, leaders of the federally recognized Paiute Indian tribe in Burns, the town closest to the refuge, decried the armed occupation, pointing out that the out-of-state militiamen were trying to claim sacred lands that are part of the tribe’s ancestral territory. 
 
 
 
 The new video, posted on Wednesday night, has only further enraged tribal leaders who recently called on law enforcement officials to protect native cultural resources at the refuge and to criminally prosecute the militiamen. 
 
 “I feel disrespected that they’re even out there,” said Jarvis Kennedy, the tribal council’s sergeant-at-arms. Kennedy said he was too upset to watch all of Finicum’s video. “It’s like me going through their drawers at their house.” 
 
 Tribe leaders and federal officials say the refuge stores confidential documents and thousands of historic artifacts, such as baskets, spears, tools and beads. The refuge is also home to Paiute burial grounds, making the militia’s recent decision to pave a road through the refuge particularly alarming. 
 
 “I could go to the Bundys where his grandparents are buried,” Kennedy said. “How would they feel if I drove over their grave and went through their heirlooms?” 
 
 In his video, Finicum said that he was showing how the wildlife refuge has done a poor job maintaining the artifacts and keeping storage rooms clean. “This needs to be taken care of, and so we’re reaching out to the Paiute people in the sincerest manner as we can,” he said on camera. “Let’s make sure that we take care of the heritage of the Native American people.” 
 
 Added militia member Blaine Cooper: “The rightful owners need to come back and claim their belongings.” 
 
 But Kennedy said the tribe has a good relationship with refuge officials and noted that the Paiute people refuse to communicate with militia leaders or visit the occupation. 
 
 “I’m not going to give them the satisfaction of meeting with them,” Charlotte Rodrique, chairwoman of the Burns Paiute tribe, told the Guardian last week. 
 
 Kennedy noted that the militiamen have had no trouble leaving and returning to the refuge and feared one of them might damage or steal their artifacts and documents. “All the stuff they are doing out there, it’s like a crime scene,” he said. “Once this is done, we’ll see what’s missing.” ||||| This weekend, Burns Paiute tribal chairperson Charlotte Roderique spoke to Indian Country Today Media Network about the status of the occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, “We are really worried about the status of the artifacts down there.” 
 
 On Friday, the tribe delivered a letter to federal agencies including the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service demanding prosecution of Ammon Bundy and other armed militants occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, “If the occupiers disturb, damage, remove, alter, or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property. 
 
 There are approximately 4,000 artifacts belonging to the tribe in the buildings the militants are holding. The occupation is entering its third week. 
 
 The tribe is demanding federal action under both the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and a ""protection against bad men” provision in the treaty the tribe signed with the United States in 1868. 
 
 Under ARPA, a federal law authorizing law enforcement and penalties in the defense of archeological sites on public land, removing artifacts is a felony offense. First time offenders can be fined up to $20,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Second time offenders can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. 
 
 Bundy supporters have damaged Native American archaeological sites before, most notably, when they drove ATVs through a canyon trail in Utah in protest of protected federal lands trampling the ruins of homes belonging to the ancient Puebloans. Also, the Southern Paiute tribes in Nevada have accused the Bundy family of defacing ancient Paiute petroglyphs in Gold Butte. Incidentally, Southern Paiute community members held a rally last week in Las Vegas in support of the Burns Paiute tribe. 
 
 “I understand they took a bulldozer and built a line around the refuge headquarters,” Roderique said. She notes that in the past when a water line was put in at the refuge the tribe’s cultural resources department oversaw the work done to make sure no artifacts or sites were disturbed. “We have a good working relationship with them. That is, the relationship has evolved for the better.” 
 
 The community has also reached out to her, “I’ve gotten calls from ranching families who support the tribe. They’ve seen the [Paiute] campsites out there. They’ve been in that area and they know where things are. You can’t go and bulldoze things. I don’t know what these people are doing if they are doing things to just get a rise or to be martyr—all they are doing is making enemies out of the people they professed to support.” 
 
 Carla Burnside, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's archaeologist at the refuge, has told the tribe that she has seen pictures in news reports of militants sitting in her office, even at her desk with files open that contain sensitive information about archaeological sites belonging to the tribe. 
 
 This past week, the Burns Paiute tribal council passed a resolution to formally recognize Malheur Lake and its shoreline as “Sacred Places and Traditional Cultural Properties” of the tribe and cited the tribe’s own “Aboriginal Lands Protection Policy” which covers “the tribe's aboriginal territory beyond current Trust lands (Resolution 2006-12) which defines cultural resources as: ‘any material objects of human life or activities that are of cultural, historical, archaeological, sacred, spiritual, or traditional interest to the tribe. This shall include all remains, sites, objects, structures, artifacts, implements, plants, animals, and locations within the tribe's aboriginal territory.’” 
 
 Occupation leader Ammon Bundy, from Arizona and son of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher involved in a standoff with the federal government over $1 million in unpaid grazing fees on public land, has offered to meet with the tribe but the tribe says he has no right to hold their history hostage and have refused to grant him even the appearance of such authority by meeting with him. 
 
 “Some of the members of the community were open to them,” Roderique says, “when they first came but now the county chained and locked everything up and said no you can’t have your meeting in town.” 
 
 Harney County officials have stated they will not allow the militants to use any county-owned building for fear of more takeovers of public property. 
 
 “They tried to ask us for our gathering center and our facility was booked up. We just kind of laughed and said they want to use our 'savage' facilities?” 
 
 Roderique was referencing a “Harney County Committee of Safety” website made by supporters of the takeover who profess to exist “to secure the property and lives of the association members from threats from the savages.” 
 
 The support, however, has been “overwhelming” says Roderique. The tribe has received letters of support from other tribes like the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and the Klamath tribe of Northern California and even farther away from First Nations tribes in Canada and many Native American organizations and Mexican American organizations. 
 
 “Those things are so empowering. When we had our press conference we didn’t know the attendance and response was going to be as big as it was. I really appreciate all the Native people for their concern because it could be any one of us that this could happen to.” 
 
 Roderique told ICTMN that it is not only title to the land that matters to her but the plants and wildlife on the land some of which are going extinct. “We are the Wadatika people. The plants we are named after grow on the banks of the Harney and Malheur lake. If they put cattle in there [Bundy has called for the land to be returned to private ranchers] they will destroy these plants.” 
 
 “As a little girl, we’d go along the river in the marshes and gather waterfowl to eat in the spring. We’d make our little tule baskets. I was told by elders if there are three eggs, take one. Leave the other two. One is going to grow up and fulfill its life. One is going to be taken by predators. So you never just go and throw all the eggs in your basket, you only, only take one. Find another nest and find another one. That way there was continuation of the species. Our people have been doing that for thousands of years and those are the things that are taught to the next generation. We restrict our hunting and gathering accordingly to ensure there is a future. We don’t have the attitude that the Bundys have.” 
 
 This weekend, the first occupier was arrested in Burns at a Safeway for theft of a government vehicle and another cited for driving without a driver’s license when the government van he was driving on icy roads overturned. And last week, Bundy’s personal bodyguard “Fluffy Unicorn” was arrested in Arizona for an outstanding warrant. 
 
 A protest is planned in Portland, Oregon on Tuesday against the illegal occupation by environmental groups including the Portland Audubon and the Center for Biological Diversity.

117,"A malfunction during the most recent test flight of the private spacecraft SpaceShipTwo sent the vehicle hurtling out of control until its crew could stabilize the craft for a safe landing. 
 
 The issue provided some heart-stopping moments for its airborne crew and ground handlers, but also allowed the vehicle's owner, Virgin Galactic, to showcase the craft's safety features. 
 
 The commercial space plane made its 16th glide flight on Sept. 29, following a hiatus for hangar work. For the first time, SpaceShipTwo carried a three-person crew — two pilots and a flight test engineer. [ Gallery — SpaceShipTwo Makes First Glide Flight ] 
 
 To begin, SpaceShipTwo was lifted to high altitude by its carrier plane, WhiteKnightTwo. After a clean release from WhiteKnightTwo, SpaceShipTwo immediately entered a rapid descent. Springing into action, the crew deployed the ship's novel feather re-entry system. 
 
 SpaceShipTwo's ability to feather its tail section is a safety feature that increases the vehicle's stability during atmospheric re-entry. Akin to the flight of a shuttlecock in badminton, the feather system allows SpaceShipTwo to rely on aerodynamics and the laws of physics to control speed and altitude. 
 
 The glide flight lasted a brief 7 minutes and 15 seconds. 
 
 Downward pitch rate 
 
 ""Upon release, the spaceship experienced a downward pitch rate that caused a stall of the tails. The crew followed procedure, selecting the feather mode to revert to a benign condition. The crew then de-feathered and had a nominal return to base,"" according to an updated flight log posted by Scaled Composites, builder of the WhiteKnightTwo /SpaceShipTwo launch system. 
 
 Scaled Composites is constructing the private spaceship fleet for Virgin Galactic, a spaceline company for suborbital space tourism backed by U.K. entrepreneur Richard Branson. 
 
 ""Great flying by the team and good demo of feather system,"" Scaled officials wrote in the flight log. 
 
 According to one observer of the craft's rapid descent, ""It dropped like a rock and went straight down. Typically, it takes 11 minutes to land, but this time it was only seven minutes before they were on the ground. It was a nail-biter … but that's how you learn."" 
 
 Flight envelope 
 
 George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic's chief executive officer and president, said the glide flight included a third seat flight test engineer onboard SpaceShipTwo for the first time. ""A good capability for us to have for this phase of test,"" he told SPACE.com. ""Yes, apparently the tails exhibited stall characteristics in the test — which was a steep nose down maneuver."" 
 
 Whitesides confirmed that SpaceShipTwo was ultimately able to carry out a nominal landing. 
 
 ""Scaled is looking at the data now, but doesn't anticipate any major issues,"" Whitesides said. ""This is why we flight test, to fully explore the aerodynamic flight envelope."" 
 
 NASA shuttle leader joins team 
 
 Meanwhile, in other Virgin Galactic news, the company has announced the appointment of former NASA executive Mike Moses as its new vice president of operations. 
 
 Moses' NASA career included serving at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida as the launch integration manager from 2008 until the landing of the final space shuttle mission in July 2011. He was responsible for supervising all shuttle processing activities from landing through launch, and for reviewing major milestones, including final readiness for flight. 
 
 According to a Virgin Galactic statement, Moses will develop and lead the team responsible for Virgin Galactic spaceship operations and logistics, flight crew operations, customer training and spaceport ground operations, primarily focusing on overall operational safety and risk management.

 The company aims to launch paying customers beyond Earth’s confines from the new $209-million futuristic-looking facility, named Spaceport America. 
 
 New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez joined Branson and a crowd of more than 800 others during the dedication ceremonies. 
 
 “Today is another history-making day for Virgin Galactic,” Branson said at the event. “We are here with a group of incredible people who are helping us lead the way in creating one of the most important new industrial sectors of the 21st century.” 
 
 Virgin Galactic said it has taken about 455 reservations for the ride. The price per flight for a would-be space tourist is $200,000. 
 
 Instead of launching people directly into space with a rocket, Virgin Galactic plans to do the following: A rocket plane with six passengers will be attached to the wings of a White Knight mother ship, flown to 50,000 feet and released. The rocket plane's engine then will ignite and propel the passengers into suborbit. 
 
 The spaceship is designed to climb to the edge of space, about 60 miles above the Earth's surface. At that suborbital altitude, people experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth. 
 
 Virgin Galactic’s sleek carrier aircraft and spaceships are made by the Spaceship Co. in Mojave, where the planes are currently undergoing test flights. Branson hopes to make its first passenger flight with his adult children, Sam and Holly, as soon as next year. 
 
 At the end of Monday’s event, the Branson trio --after rappelling down the side of the Spaceport’s massive glass windows -- named one of the ground terminals the Virgin Galactic Gateway to Space. 
 
 The gateway will house preparation facilities for company’s passengers, which it calls astronauts. There is also a mission control center and an area for friends and family.

 ""We are working on a bill right now that will, hopefully, at least get the records of those adjudicated, the mentally incompetent and dangerous into the check system that applies on dealers,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" 
 
 ""Most of the states still do not even do that. We need to see if we can get that done. We're looking to get better enforcement at the federal gun laws. We're looking at laws that beef up the penalties on straw purchases and illegal trafficking, which we want prosecuted."" 
 
 ""I hope we end up signing something that updates the system and gets those mentally incompetent and adjudicated into the system. We force the administration somehow to enforce the federal gun laws,"" LaPierre said. ""I know they don't want to do it but they ought to do it. It's their responsibility."" 
 
 ""That would make people safe,"" he said. ""If you're a drug dealer, a gang member, a [felon] -- and you touch a gun, it's a 100 percent certainty that you're going to be prosecuted and taken off the street. That ought to start tomorrow morning it they won't do it unless the national media gets on the administration and calls them out for their incredible lack of enforcement on these laws.""

 ""While I think we are going to win this, celebrating in advance isn't the right thing to do,"" the mayor said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" We've got to go out, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. But I don't think we should give up on the assault weapons ban. But clearly, it is a more difficult issue for a lot of people,"" 
 
 ""I don't know that that reflects the NRA's power,"" he added. ""It may be just that people have different views about assault weapons than they do about background checks. Ninety percent of the people want background checks, period."" 
 
 Last week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) made clear that an assault weapons ban put forth by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) would not be included in Senate Democrats' gun reform proposal, though it could be added as an amendment. 
 
 ""We've been fighting since 2007 to get a vote. We are going to have a vote for sure on assault weapons and we're going to have a vote on background checks. And if we were to get background checks only, it wouldn't be as good as if we got both, but -- we demanded a plan and then we demanded a vote."" Bloomberg said.

 Read more about: Barack Obama, Israel, Michael Bloomberg, Israeli-Palestinian Conflict ||||| The mayor’s advertising blitz, which will saturate television screens in states including Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Arizona, represents by far the biggest escalation of Mr. Bloomberg’s attempts to become a one-man counterweight to the National Rifle Association in the political clash over guns. 
 
 “The N.R.A. has just had this field to itself,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “It’s the only one that’s been speaking out. It’s time for another voice.” 
 
 After months of wrangling, the current package of Senate legislation would expand background checks for gun buyers, increase penalties for people who buy firearms for those barred from owning them and would give law enforcement new tools to combat illegal gun trafficking, a longtime goal of Mr. Bloomberg’s. 
 
 Given the mayor’s role in contributing to the ouster of an N.R.A.-backed candidate in an Illinois Congressional race a few weeks ago, his push carries an unmistakable threat to those who vote against the bills. 
 
 The ads are directed at Democratic and Republican senators in both swing states and partisan precincts. Among Mr. Bloomberg’s targets are some of the Senate’s most vulnerable Democrats, including Kay R. Hagan of North Carolina, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark L. Pryor of Arkansas, for whom the gun issue is particularly problematic because they will need Republican votes to win re-election. 
 
 Some of the senators, such as Dean Heller of Nevada, Rob Portman of Ohio and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, all Republicans, represent swing states where voters are divided over guns. Other Republicans would seem to be out of reach for Mr. Bloomberg: Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Daniel Coats of Indiana and Jeff Flake of Arizona. 
 
 In each case, the commercials urge support for the measure requiring background checks for nearly all firearms purchases, not just those in gun stores, the most debated element of the legislation and a coveted goal of gun control advocates.

 Mr. Bloomberg has singled out Mr. Flake, who already voted against the expansion of background checks in the Senate Judiciary Committee, by producing a special, scolding commercial aimed at Arizona. “Flake’s vote,” the ad declares, equals “no background checks for dangerous criminals.”

 The mayor, who has spent tens of millions of dollars to support his favored candidates, intends to wield his “super PAC” to influence the midterm Congressional elections next year and beyond. He said he would prefer “candidates who will stop people from getting killed.” 
 
 “There is an easy measure of how you decide who those are,” he said, noting that gun rights groups rate lawmakers. “The N.R.A. keeps score of it for you. They are public information.”

 To those who might fear his financial might, he added: “If they pass sensible gun legislation, there is not an issue and I don’t have to spend a dime.” 
 
 The N.R.A. plans to roll out its own lobbying campaign, using print and broadcast advertising to reach lawmakers during the recess. But its leaders said that their investment was unlikely to rival the intensity of Mr. Bloomberg’s spending, to be carried out through Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group he co-founded. 
 
 “Can we match Mayor Bloomberg dollar for dollar?” asked Chris W. Cox, the group’s chief lobbyist. “No one can. We don’t have to.” 
 
 He predicted that voters and senators would resist a message from an out-of-state magnate who is associated with government limits on soda and salt. 
 
 “What he is going to find out is that Americans don’t want to be told by some elitist billionaire what they can eat, drink and they damn well don’t want to be told how, when and where they can protect their families,” Mr. Cox said. 
 
 Thomas E. Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, agreed that Mr. Bloomberg “is not popular in many of the states he is going into right now.”

 He said that $12 million in advertising was unlikely to influence the outcome of the legislation unless lawmakers were convinced that Mr. Bloomberg would open his wallet again after the vote — both to reward those who supported the bill and to punish those who did not. “That is absolutely key,” Mr. Mann said. 
 
 Mr. Flake, for example, was just elected and will not face voters again until 2018. 
 
 For those like Mr. Bloomberg, who believed the shooting in Newtown, Conn., was a turning point in the gun debate, it is a somewhat humbling moment. President Obama has called for bold action, and former Representative Gabrielle Giffords has lent her personal story to the cause. 
 
 Still, what they are now fighting for is, by the admission of gun control advocates, a diminished version of what they wanted — and even that is proving a tough sell. 
 
 “These ideas shouldn’t be controversial,” the president said in his radio address on Saturday. 
 
 Mr. Bloomberg lamented that “sausage and the law aren’t pretty the way they are made.” 
 
 But he is eager to seize what he can. “I think you’ve got as good a chance as we’ve ever had,” the mayor said.","– Michael Bloomberg was today busily putting his mouth where his money will be tomorrow, Politico reports, when he kicks off a $12 million ad blitz targeting 13 senators considered vulnerable on gun control. Appearing on Meet the Press, the New York City mayor said ""we are going to win"" measures supporting heightened background checks, and dismissed Harry Reid's abandonment of an assault weapons ban, saying, ""I don't think we should give up on"" it. He did, however, concede that ""people have different views about assault weapons than they do about background checks."" Bloomberg's rhetoric, meanwhile, has the NRA's Wayne LaPierre seeing red, calling his comments ""reckless,"" ""ridiculous,"" and ""insane."" Americans ""don't want him in their restaurants, (and) they sure don't want him telling them what self-defense firearms to own. And he can't buy America,"" LaPierre fumed.

This is prompted by the Sandy Hook murders. Those guns were legally purchased with a background check. Let's be very careful before trampling on the rights of people. If you want to get something done, then stop scaring people."" California AG Kamala Harris: ""The folks in DC have to reject a false choice that suggests that you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or that you're in favor of reasonable and common sense gun laws. You can be both. I as a career prosecutor have personally seen cases of both police officers and innocent babies being killed by assault weapons. There is no reasonable basis for having those on our streets."" Mike Rogers on Syria's chemical weapons: It's ""abundantly clear that red line has been crossed. Now is the time.""

119,"Federal customs officials have stopped more than 20,000 pairs of counterfeit luxury shoes from tip-toeing into the U.S. from China. 
 
 U.S. Customs and Border Protection Spokesman Jaime Ruiz says four shipments of fake Christian Louboutin shoes were seized Tuesday, and another shipment was seized July 27. 
 
 Ruiz says the shoes could have sold for a total of $18 million in the U.S. 
 
 The vaunted French designer's shoes come in an array of colors and styles, often commanding thousands of dollars per pair from well-heeled customers. 
 
 Celebrities and royalty have been known to wear Louboutins, which have red soles. 
 
 The knockoff shoes were likely destined for swap meets or sale through websites. 
 
 Ruiz says the shoes were very good counterfeits and will likely be destroyed. ||||| If you find a pair of those trendy red-bottom heels for a deal that sounds too good to be true, it probably is.U.S. Customs and Border Protection confiscated 20,457 pairs of counterfeit Christian Louboutin shoes at the Los Angeles/Long Beach seaport. 
 
 “They label the shipments as generic shoes when, in fact, they’re bringing over contraband,” said Jaime Ruiz, a public affairs specialist for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
 
 According to the CBP, the knock-off shoes that were transported in five different shipments on a cargo ship in large boxes from China had a domestic value of more than $57,000, meaning it cost just less than $3 per pair to make them. 
 
 Officials said there were enough of those red soles to add up to a suggested retail value of $18 million, an unbelievable profit. 
 
 “The original [Christian Louboutin] shoe is made in Italy,” said chief CBP officer Guillermina Escobar. “Once we saw it was coming in from China, we knew there was a problem with the shipment.” 
 
 Officials took pictures of the shoes and consulted with the trademark holder to authenticate the shoe. Once they learned they were counterfeit, the hot commodities were taken off the black market and placed into the border patrol’s possession. 
 
 Had the shoes slipped through the cracks, Escobar said, they would likely have been sold on illegitimate websites and underground outlets, some of which may fail to mention the shoes are counterfeits. 
 
 The CBP said it will destroy the more than 20,000 pairs of high-fashion shoes, likely by burning them. 
 
 Escobar said a total of three different importers shipped the counterfeits on July 27 and Aug. 14 of this year. 
 
 The incident is still under investigation but the importers will likely be charged with a trademark violation. 
 
 CBP officials said there were 24,792 seizures of counterfeit and pirated goods in the 2011 fiscal year. 
 
 One thousand twenty of those trade seizures had a domestic value exceeding $37 million and all took place in the greater Los Angeles area. 
 
 “This represents an 18 percent increase in the number of seizures from fiscal year 2010,” said Escobar. 
 
 The CBP said it knows what hot commodities are coming in to the United States and will make sure to keep an eye out for any more counterfeits.

 President Donald Trump ordered the creation of a task force to review business practices at the United States Postal Service, a move that could affect one of the president’s favorite corporate targets: Amazon.com Inc. 
 
 “The USPS is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout,” the president said in an order that was released Thursday night. The order calls for an examination of the Postal Service’s pricing, policies and workforce costs. 
 
 The Postal Service has lost more than $65 billion over the past decade as Americans increasingly transmit messages online, according to the executive order. The task force will be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or his designee, according to the order.

 In a series of Twitter messages, Trump has accused Amazon of draining the Postal Service of money it can’t afford to lose. Trump’s sustained attacks on one of the world’s largest companies have hurt Amazon’s stock price and raised questions about government interference in the private sector. 
 
 A White House official said the presidential order was intended to come up with solutions to the problems at the Postal Service. The official didn’t deny that the task force’s recommendations could affect Amazon. A second White House official disputed the notion that the order was directed at Amazon, and also said that the task force was charged with improving the mail service. 
 
 Both officials were granted anonymity, to discuss administration deliberations.

 Amazon declined to comment. 
 
 Trump has claimed that Amazon was “costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,” a situation that puts “many thousands of retailers out of business.” He repeated a claim that the postal service loses “$1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon” and said “only fools, or worse” believe the Postal Service makes money from doing business with Amazon. 
 
 Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, which has aggressively covered the Trump administration. 
 
 Since signing a landmark five-year contract in 2013 to deliver packages on Sundays, Amazon and the Postal Service have declared their business relationship a success, although the terms of the contract are confidential. 
 
 ‘Last Mile’ 
 
 The Postal Service says it makes money on the Amazon deal, and it’s legally prohibited from charging shippers less than its delivery costs. E-commerce revenue provides “essential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,” David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. “All users of the mail benefit.” 
 
 Amazon regularly uses the Postal Service to complete what’s called the “last mile” of delivery, with letter carriers dropping off packages at some 150 million residences and businesses daily. The company has a network of 35 “sort center” where customer packages are sorted by ZIP code, stacked on pallets and delivered to post offices for the final leg of delivery. 
 
 “Amazon has the money to pay the fair rate at the Post Office, which would be much more than they’re paying now,” Trump said to reporters at the White House earlier this month. “Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the Post Office, there’s no doubt about that.” 
 
 The executive order requires the commission to examine “the expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS’s role in competitive markets.” 
 
 Previous Studies 
 
 It’s not clear what effect the task force would ultimately have, since most changes to the Postal Service’s business structure would require new legislation. The Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission. 
 
 The task force will be looking at issues that have been studied for years by multiple government bodies that have already issued recommendations and reports focusing on the financial stability of the Postal Service. 
 
 For example, Trump’s executive order requires the task force to review the definition of the “universal service obligation,” which is a loosely defined mandate for the Postal Service to provide affordable service to all customers. 
 
 The Post Service’s Office of Inspector General issued a report in 2014 with recommendations for redefining the obligation in the digital age. In 2016, the same office released a report with recommendations for financing the mandate. 
 
 The task force will be required to submit a report to the president within 120 days with recommendations for “administrative and legislative reforms,” according to the order.

 President Donald Trump took a swing at Amazon once more on April 2, blaming the digital retailer for the United States Postal Service’s financial woes. 
 
 ""Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,"" Trump tweeted. ""THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!"" 
 
 Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2018 
 
 We addressed the closing of retailers across the country in another Amazon-USPS tweet-inspired story last week. (Trump had a point.) But for this fact-check, we wondered whether Amazon is causing the Postal Service to ""lose a fortune."" 
 
 The post office is losing a fortune, but Trump is wrong to blame Amazon. 
 
 Parcels are growing the Postal Service 
 
 The Postal Service reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for 2017. It has lost $65.1 billion since 2007. Much of the red ink is attributed to a 2006 law mandating that USPS pre-fund future retirees’ health benefits. 
 
 First-class mail, the USPS’ biggest source of revenue, also continued to shrink, seeing a $1.87 billion revenue loss in fiscal year 2017. 
 
 Package delivery, however, was one of the few bright spots in its latest financial statement. In 2017, parcels brought in $19.5 billion, or 28 percent of USPS’ annual revenue. At $2.1 billion, packages contributed the largest revenue increase. 
 
 Deals with private shippers like Amazon accounted for $7 billion of the $19.5 billion in revenue. While we know that Amazon is the biggest e-commerce player, we don’t know exactly how much of the $7 billion comes from Amazon, because the details of the postal service’s deals with private shippers are considered proprietary and not made public. 
 
 A good deal? 
 
 USPS ships about 40 percent of Amazon’s packages. Amazon bulk-delivers packages to a USPS distribution center, and the Postal Service brings it to your door. USPS negotiates the discounted rate for that service with Amazon, as it does all other bulk shippers. 
 
 Those rates are kept under wraps. That said, we do know the Amazon deal is at least a break-even venture. 
 
 That’s because the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost. 
 
 ""By law our competitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon, must cover their costs,"" an August 2017 USPS press release said. ""Our regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), looks carefully at this question every year and has determined that they do. The PRC has also noted that competitive products help fund the infrastructure of the Postal Service."" 
 
 In fact, the Postal Regulatory Commission gave the green light to the USPS-Amazon deal the same day Trump began tweeting about Amazon last week. 
 
 Trump might have a point, however, in saying the USPS could be making more money off Amazon. For example, Citigroup found that on average, USPS was charging $1.46 below market rates for parcel delivery (not just to Amazon). 
 
 Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers, explained the Postal Service can offer lower prices than their private competitors because they already ""go to every house, every day."" 
 
 ""We’re already going there to deliver mail and bills and advertising, so the marginal cost of delivering an extra package is not high, especially in the low-density areas,"" Sauber said. 
 
 Our ruling 
 
 Trump tweeted, ""Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed."" 
 
 Amazon isn’t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it’s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. 
 
 While we don’t know the deal USPS crafted with Amazon, we know it’s not losing money. A 2006 law codified profitability into law, and an independent regulatory commission that reviews their deals annually gave it a green light on March 29. 
 
 That said, it’s possible that the Postal Service could be charging Amazon more for package delivery and therefore get a better deal. That still doesn’t mean USPS is losing a fortune. 
 
 We rate this claim False.","– President Trump has railed against Amazon repeatedly in recent weeks, accusing Jeff Bezos' company of getting a sweetheart deal from the Postal Service on delivery. On Thursday night, the president took what could be his first tangible step toward changing that: He issued an executive order calling for a review of the agency's finances, reports Bloomberg. The order, which does not mention Amazon, notes the USPS has lost more than $65 billion over the last decade. ""The USPS is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout,"" the order reads.

 Starbucks has been working to... ||||| NEW YORK Starbucks Coffee Company, which has exported coffee beans from Colombia for more than four decades, plans to open its first café in the Andean country in 2014 and serve only locally-grown coffee. 
 
 The world's biggest coffee chain hopes to open at least 50 coffee shops in cities across Colombia in the next five years, starting in the capital Bogota. 
 
 The announcement by the Seattle based-firm coincided with protests by local coffee growers who are demanding the government provide more aid to counter low global prices and cheap imports hitting the world's biggest producer of washed arabica beans. 
 
 ""We've had great success in Latin American and it's well overdue for us to open up in Colombia,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters in an interview, adding that he hoped to open at least six stores in the first year. 
 
 A military crackdown on drug-funded insurgent groups has made Colombia more attractive to foreign firms once fearful of investing in the nation when the conflict between Marxist FARC rebels and the government was at its height. 
 
 In addition to opening stores, Starbucks said it would partner with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and invest a joint $3 million in a plan to help 25,000 farmers in conflict-hit areas of Colombia increase coffee yields. 
 
 Starbucks' new coffee shops will be run by a joint venture between Mexican restaurant firm Alsea, which operates more than 500 Starbucks stores in Latin America, and Colcafe, a subsidiary of Grupo Nutresa, the fourth-largest Colombian food company. 
 
 Colcafe helped Starbucks develop Via, its instant coffee product, launched in 2008. The Via manufacturing business, Starbucks' only roasting facility in Colombia, will be expanded to roast espresso blends and packaged coffee for sale in the country. 
 
 ""We want to sell Colombian coffee in Colombia,"" said Craig Russell, Starbucks' senior vice president of global coffee. 
 
 The USAID-Starbucks program will be directed at farmers in Antioquia, Tolima, Huila and Cauca, rich coffee-growing areas where there is still a FARC presence. 
 
 A major aim of the initiative is to reduce ""extreme poverty, which is still a reality for almost all of these small-scale coffee growers that have barely one hectare (2.5 acres) of land,"" said USAID chief Raj Shah. 
 
 Carlos Piedrahita, head of Nutresa, said Starbucks' entrance into Colombia's coffee shop market would mean investment and jobs. 
 
 ""This means more demand for our national produce,"" said Piedrahita, speaking at a press conference in Bogota alongside Schultz. 
 
 Starbucks said its research suggests the cost of the chain's beverages, known for being relatively expensive around the world, won't deter consumers. The company declined to reveal its Colombia pricing, citing competitiveness. 
 
 Schultz said Starbucks would not undercut the country's farmer-owned Juan Valdez chain and probably charge a little more to create Starbucks ""home-from-home"" lounge environment. He emphasized the company wanted to make a ""respectful"" entry into a country that has been a key coffee supplier for many years. 
 
 (Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington DC and Peter Murphy in Bogota; editing by Andrew Hay) ||||| After buying coffee from Colombia for almost half a century, Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) is finally opening a cafe there, part of its accelerating expansion in Latin America. 
 
 The world’s largest coffee-shop operator will open a cafe in Bogota in the first half of next year and then five more locations later in 2014, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said in a telephone interview. The stores will be operated through a joint venture between Alsea SAB (ALSEA*) and Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA), and will sell locally sourced and roasted espresso and coffee. 
 
 “This is long overdue,” Schultz said. “There is tremendous enthusiasm as we talk to people and walk the streets -- most of these Colombian people we talked to have consumed Starbucks coffee somewhere else.” 
 
 It would be disappointing if Starbucks didn’t have 50 stores in Colombia in five years, Schultz said at a press event in Bogota today. 
 
 Starbucks is expanding to countries with growing middle classes to help boost sales. The Seattle-based company, which has about 8,000 cafes outside the U.S., opened its first locations in India in 2012 and Vietnam this year. In Colombia, Starbucks will compete with chains such as Juan Valdez Cafe, whose parent company Procafecol SA was created in 2002 by the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation. 
 
 Alsea, based in Mexico City, earlier this year acquired parts of Starbucks Argentina and Chile that it didn’t already own. Alsea, which operates Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ) and Burger King Worldwide Inc. (BKW) stores in Latin America, will have a 70 percent stake in Starbucks operations in Colombia. Grupo Nutresa, based in Medellin, Colombia, is the nation’s largest publicly traded food company. 
 
 USAID Agreement 
 
 Starbucks also is forming a pact with the U.S. Agency for International Development to invest $3 million to secure coffee quality and supply in certain regions of Colombia. Starbucks and USAID are each investing $1.5 million during the next three years for research to help small-plot coffee farmers in Colombia. The money will go to Starbucks’s farmer support center in Manizales to pay for agronomists to analyze soil and advise growers on factors that affect yield, such as climate, pests and fertilizers. 
 
 Colombia has been Starbucks’s largest or second-largest coffee-bean supplier in its 42-year history, Schultz said during an earlier interview. In 2012, Starbucks bought about 545 million pounds of coffee from 29 countries, about 27 percent more than it bought the previous year, according to the company’s annual global responsibility report. 
 
 Recently, the company has invested in countries where it buys beans to help secure supply and consistent quality as it opens more locations. Earlier this year, Starbucks bought a farm in Costa Rica to experiment with coffee varieties and expand its grower-support program. 
 
 Farmer Support 
 
 Starbucks opened its first farmer support center in 2004 in Costa Rica. Last year, it opened branches in Colombia and China for agronomists to help local coffee growers improve the quality and size of their harvests. The cafe operator has said it wants to sell all ethically sourced coffee by 2015. 
 
 USAID has initiated other projects to help areas in Colombia affected by internal conflict, drug trafficking and violence. Last year, the government agency began working on a program to increase access to renewable energy in the South American nation. 
 
 Starbucks, which has about 19,200 stores worldwide, has gained 34 percent this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has advanced 16 percent.

 FORT WORTH -- Police carried out evidence and wrapped police tape around the home where the 36-year-old Shanna Vandewege and her infant son Diederik were found dead Thursday night. 
 
 
 
 Police confirmed they were investigating the deaths as homicides. According to Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office, both died from an ""incised wound"" to the neck. 
 
 ""This is the first time I've even seen cops at the house,"" says Bradly DaLuz, who lives across the street. 
 
 Vandewege's Facebook page shows her and her husband Craig smiling with their little boy. 
 
 ""They tried so long to have a baby. She had three miscarriages prior to having one,"" says Mark Riddle, Shanna's father. 
 
 Riddle spoke to News 8 by phone from Colorado Friday. He was stunned by the tragedy that has struck his family. He says Craig discovered the bodies Thursday night when he came home from work. 
 
 ""To the best I understand, he walked in, the house was all in disorder and walked in and found them both,"" RIddle says. 
 
 The medical examiner's office says the bodies were found in a bed. 
 
 ""It's puzzling what happened,"" says neighbor Eric Tivnan. He and other neighbors are trying to figure out if they, too, should be concerned for their safety. Police did not say whether it appeared to be a home invasion. Late Friday afternoon, the medical examiner announced the baby's cause of death was an incised wound of the neck. 
 
 ""I wouldn’t have expected it here, lets put it that way,"" says neighbor DaLuz. 
 
 The Vandewege family had only moved to Fort Worth from Colorado earlier this year, and by all accounts were a loving couple. Riddle says Shanna was a registered nurse and Craig works at Costco. Police say they interviewed Craig, who was cooperative. Police went on later Friday to say they were not looking at one specific person as a suspect, and that they hadn't ruled anyone out. 
 
 All of it has left the family devastated and dumbfounded. 
 
 ""A new mother, a three-month-old baby... why? Why kill them? There's no reason,"" Riddle says.

 Réamhamharc ||||| A man whose wife and infant son were found slain last week in the family’s north Fort Worth home has been jailed in Colorado and is now accused in their deaths. 
 
 Fort Worth homicide detectives obtained a capital murder warrant Thursday for Craig Alan Vandewege, hours after the 35-year-old Fort Worth man was arrested in Glenwood Springs, Colo., for allegedly speeding and failing to show proof of insurance. 
 
 Vandewege was in the processing of posting bond at the Garfield County Jail on Thursday afternoon when authorities in Colorado were notified of the warrant. 
 
 “My understanding is he was in the process of bonding out and just about to leave,” said Glendwood Springs Police Chief Terry Wilson.

 Bail on the warrant is set at $1 million. 
 
 Vandewege called 911 on the night of Dec. 15 to report that he had come home to find his wife, Shanna Riddle Vandewege, and their 3-month-old son, Diederik, dead in the home in the 8500 block of Cactus Flower Drive. 
 
 The necks of the mother and baby — who were found in their beds — had been cut, and their deaths were ruled homicides. 
 
 Homicide Sgt. Joe Loughman would not disclose Thursday what evidence investigators have linking Vandewege to the slayings. 
 
 Vandewege had reportedly gone to Colorado to attend the pair’s funeral service. 
 
 A report obtained by the Star-Telegram details his encounter with Glenwood Springs police late Wednesday as follows: 
 
 Glenwood Springs police were dispatched to a 7-Eleven about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday after a caller reported that a man had stated he was on the run from police and had gotten into a white Hyundai with no front license plate. 
 
 The caller told dispatchers that the man, whom he identified as “Craig Allen,” had borrowed his phone to call a few people to talk about a murder. He gave the direction the man was heading. 
 
 Shortly after 11 p.m., an officer spotted a similar vehicle with no rear license plate. The officer followed the car, watching as it pulled into a Shell gas station. The officer saw the male driver get out of the car, retrieve a license plate from the trunk and screw it onto the license plate holder. 
 
 The driver then got back into the car and drove away, accelerating rapidly, the report states. 
 
 After clocking the car traveling 37 mph in a 25-mph zone, the officer pulled over the Hyundai, which now showed a rear Texas license plate. 
 
 Vandewege told the officer that he didn’t realize he was speeding and that he was headed to Las Vegas. 
 
 “It’s been a long week, my wife and kid were murdered in Texas,” Vandewege is quoted in the report as telling the officers. 
 
 He then handed the officers an attorney’s contract for services, telling them they could call his attorney if they needed to verify what he was telling them. 
 
 “He stated that his wife and son were murdered in Ft Worth, Tx. He was showing no emotion while telling this” to the officer, the report states. 
 
 Glenwood Springs contacted Fort Worth police, who advised that Vandewege had not been ruled out as a suspect in his wife and child’s slaying, had “fled the area” and hadn’t had contact with investigators since, the report states. 
 
 Glenwood Springs police asked Vandewege to step out of his car after he presented them with an expired insurance card, but he responded, “No, I’m not getting out.” 
 
 “This went on for approximately 5 minutes and he finally agreed to get out of the vehicle,” the report states. 
 
 Vandewege was then handcuffed. Asked if he had any knives on him, Vandewege reportedly told the officer, “No, I’m not a knife guy.” 
 
 Police did find two loaded pistols on Vandewege — one in a waistband holder and one in an ankle holster. Vandewege presented officers with a concealed handgun permit issued in Weld County, Colo. 
 
 “I did not observe a wedding band on Craig’s left ring finger, but he stated a wedding ring was in his pocket along with numerous condoms,” the report states. 
 
 Vandewege was taken to jail and his car was impounded. Inside the vehicle, police located numerous boxes of different caliber ammunition, empty gas cans, camouflage clothing, numerous bottles of medication, an AR-15-style rifle and a .22-caliber revolver. 
 
 The couple moved to Fort Worth earlier this year from Colorado. Vandewege worked at a Costco, and his wife was a registered nurse at a hospital. 
 
 Mark Riddle, Shanna Vandewege’s father, has said that his daughter had previously suffered three miscarriage and that the pair were ecstatic with the birth of their first child. She was on maternity leave when she and the baby were killed. 
 
 Before the capital murder warrant was issued, Riddle had expressed support for his son-in-law in a comment made on a Star-Telegram article, calling other comments left by readers “detrimental” to his daughter’s husband and “his innocence.” 
 
 “I believe in him and so do all of the other family members and friends gathered,” Riddle wrote. “Until you have had to deal with the mixed emotions that we’ve been experiencing since this episode, do not be judgmental lest you be judged.”","– Shanna Vandewege had suffered a trio of miscarriages, which made the birth of son Diederik all the more incredible. Vandewege had just three joyful months with her boy: The 36-year-old and her baby were found dead by way of ""incised wounds"" to the neck in their Fort Worth home on Dec. 15, reports WFAA. Husband Craig Vandewege called 911 after discovering their bodies—and has now been arrested for their murders. Craig Vandewege initially told police he found them in the master bedroom upon coming home from work. ""To the best I understand, he walked in, the house was all in disorder,"" Shanna Vandewege's father initially said. The deaths sparked fears in the Texas neighborhood they had moved to earlier this year from Colorado. The latter state is where Craig Vandewege was ultimately arrested, initially for speeding and not providing proof of insurance while in Glenwood Springs. He was in the state for his family's funerals. A capital murder warrant was obtained Thursday, reports the Star-Telegram, but no information regarding evidence or motive has been revealed. One detail from the arrest report: ""I did not observe a wedding band on Craig’s left ring finger, but he stated a wedding ring was in his pocket along with numerous condoms."" Police found two pistols, an AR-15-style rifle, a .22-caliber revolver, camouflage clothing, and ammunition on his person and in the car.

It's possible the writer of the tablet's riddles lived within this kingdom. The tablet's current location is unknown. 
 
 Millennia before modern-day Americans made fun of their politicians or cracked crude jokes over a cold one, people in ancient Mesopotamia were doing much the same thing. 
 
 The evidence of sex, politics and beer-drinking comes from a newly translated tablet, dating back more than 3,500 years, which reveals a series of riddles. 
 
 The text is fragmentary in parts and appears to have been written by an inexperienced hand, possibly a student. The researchers aren't sure where the tablet originates, though they suspect its scribe lived in the southern part of Mesopotamia, near the Persian Gulf. 
 
 The translation, by Nathan Wasserman, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology, and Michael Streck, a professor with the Altorientalisches Institut at Universität Leipzig, is detailed in the most recent edition of the journal Iraq. [In Photos: Ancient Riddles Decoded] 
 
 Rare riddles 
 
 The text was written in Akkadian, using cuneiform script. It was a language commonly used by the Babylonians, along with other ancient kingdoms in the Middle East. 
 
 ""This is a relatively rare genre — we don't have many riddles,"" Wasserman told LiveScience in an interview, referring to riddles written in the Akkadian language. 
 
 Unfortunately, researchers are not certain where the tablet is presently located. In 1976, it was housed in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. At that time, a scholar named J.J. van Dijk published a copy of the Akkadian inscription, which the researchers used for their translation. 
 
 Since 1976, Iraq has been through three wars and, during the 2003 invasion, the museum was pillaged. ""We tried to figure out where the tablet is now, [but] I don't know,"" Wasserman said. He added that the tablet is small and not very impressive-looking, something that a looter may take a pass on, ""I very much hope that it is still there,"" Wasserman said. [10 Battles for the Control of Iraq] 
 
 Political humor 
 
 Some of the decoded riddles are crude and sexual, while others are complex and metaphorical. One of them reveals what appears to be a bit of political humor, albeit with a dark, violent twist. 
 
 He gouged out the eye: 
 
 It is not the fate of a dead man. 
 
 He cut the throat: A dead man (-Who is it?) 
 
 The answer is a governor. 
 
 ""This riddle describes the power of a governor namely to act as a judge who punishes or sentences to death,"" write Streck and Wasserman in the journal article. 
 
 Wasserman has seen examples in other Akkadian texts of people criticizing their leaders. ""We have some interesting traces of political criticism, and [I] might say even say political anger,"" he said. ""It could be a kind of political humor expressed in this governor riddle."" 
 
 While the governor riddle reflects a sort of gallows' humor, others are much lighter. 
 
 In(?) your mouth and your teeth (or: your urine) 
 
 constantly stared at you 
 
 the measuring vessel of your lord (-What is it?) 
 
 The answer, it appears, is beer. 
 
 Crude and lewd 
 
 Politics and beer were not the only things the scribe commented on. Two of the riddles, now in a fragmentary state, are sexual, crude and difficult to understand. 
 
 One of them, whose translation is uncertain, reads: 
 
 The deflowered (girl) did not become pregnant 
 
 The undeflowered (girl) became pregnant (-What is it?) 
 
 The answer, strangely enough, appears to be ""auxiliary forces,"" a group of soldiers that tend not to be reliable. 
 
 Wasserman said that the meaning of this riddle eludes him. ""I don't understand what is really going on,"" he said, adding that auxiliary forces are often below-average soldiers, ""and they are not really trustworthy, sometimes they run away in the middle of the battle."" 
 
 Another riddle, this one even more fragmentary and whose translation is uncertain, is also very crude. 
 
 ... of your mother 
 
 is by the one who has intercourse (with her) (-What/who is it?) 
 
 The researchers aren't sure of the riddle's solution since the answer has been lost. 
 
 Ancient metaphor 
 
 One of the riddles appears to rely on metaphor to get its point across. 
 
 The tower is high 
 
 it is high, but nonetheless has no shade (- What is it?) 
 
 The answer is sunlight. 
 
 ""You have to think about the riddle like the 'Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit'; it is metaphor,"" Wasserman said. Imagine you are outside and see a beam of light going from sky to Earth. [Science Fact or Fantasy? 20 Imaginary Worlds] 
 
 ""It looks like a tower, but it gives no shade, of course, because it's light itself,” Wasserman said. ""The answer is the proof for its own validity."" 
 
 The last riddle relies on logic: 
 
 (Note the translation of the first line is uncertain) 
 
 Like a fish in a fish pond 
 
 Like troops before the king (-What is it?) 
 
 The answer is a broken bow.

 Here's why that solution makes sense: Soldiers in front of their king are soldiers that are not out fighting or guarding the kingdom. Also ""a fish in a fish pond is not really helpful if you are hungry,"" Wasserman said. A broken bow is useless as well, ""a broken bow is not really helpful if you need to go to war or to hunt a deer."" 
 
 The researchers emphasized in their paper that the number of surviving Akkadian riddles from this time period is ""very small"" and, overall, this tablet provides a rare opportunity to explore this genre of ancient writing. 
 
 Follow LiveScience for the latest in science news and discoveries on Twitter @livescience and on Facebook. ||||| Around 1,500 BCE, a student in ancient Babylon inscribed six riddles on a tablet. 3,500 years later, these proto-jokes lose a lot in the translation, but one thing's for sure: the Babylonians are saying something about your mother. 
 
 The tablet in question was first discovered back in 1976 by an archaeologist named J.J. van Dijk during excavations in present-day Iraq. Sadly, the tablet itself has since disappeared, but van Dijk left behind a copy of what the tablet had to say, as well as the delightfully pissy assertion that the tablet featured ""very careless writing"" and so was obviously the work of a student. 
 
 The tablet features a half-dozen riddles, which researchers Nathan Wasserman and Michael Streck recently analyzed for the journal Iraq. Though they call the tablet an example of ""wisdom literature,"" meaning these the riddles were metaphors meant to impart pithy little truths. And while there's definitely an aspect of that, at least a few of the riddles sound like some very early stabs at comedy. Take this one for example: 
 
 Advertisement 
 
 In your mouth and your teeth, constantly stared at you, the measuring vessel of your lord. What is it? Beer. 
 
 Would it make that riddle any funnier if I told you an alternate translation for ""your teeth"" is ""your urine""? Maybe not. Well, how about this bawdy joke about deflowered women? 
 
 The deflowered girl did not become pregnant. The undeflowered girl became pregnant. What is it? Auxiliary forces. 
 
 Admittedly, that one is a bit conceptual. It's also possible that we've discovered the ancient Babylonian answer to Andy Kaufman. Either way, I want to see ""auxiliary forces"" as everybody's go-to punchline starting...NOW. Next up, a cutting bit of political humor: 
 
 Sponsored 
 
 He gouged out the eye. It is not the fate of a dead man. He cut the throat: A dead man. Who is it? A governor. 
 
 The translation across 35 centuries does the riddle no favors, but to be fair - I can at least see how that has the structure of something we might call a joke, in that it describes the punitive powers of a governor in less than flattering terms. But enough with these warm-up acts - let's get to the headliner, the ancient Babylonian ""yo mama"" joke. Here it is...or what's left of it, anyway: 
 
 ...of your mother is by the one who has intercourse with her. What/who is it? [No answer] 
 
 Yes, tragically, this no doubt devastating takedown of somebody's mother's sexual proclivities has been lost to history. Though I do appreciate Wasserman and Streck leaving it ambiguous whether the word is ""who"" or ""what"" the mother is having sex with - even in ancient Babylon, you just can't rule anything out when talking about one's mother. Or perhaps the original answer wasn't lost at all, and maybe the whole point is that nothing human or otherwise would ever deign to have ancient Babylonian sex with this poor unfortunate's mother. We may never know, but I feel confident saying this is the single most important question facing modern archaeology. 
 
 Incidentally, the oldest known joke is - and it makes me very proud of humanity to be able to say this - a fart joke. Here's a 3,900 year old zinger from Sumer: 
 
 ""Something which has never occurred since time immemorial - a young woman did not fart in her husband's lap."" 
 
 Well, it's certainly about farts, although I suppose the ""joke"" bit is debatable. Then again, I shudder to think what people are going to make of what we considered comedy in the year 5,500. Except Parks and Recreation, of course - the brilliance of Ron Swanson transcends all known boundaries of space and time. 
 
 Iraq via Discoblog. ||||| 3500 years ago, a student in Babylon did the inevitable and carved jokes about ""beer,"" ""intercourse,"" and ""your mother"" into a tablet. Now researchers have done the inevitable and published an elevated dissection of said jokes in a reputable journal. In recognition of the great future minds who will a millenia from now ponder ""Two And A Half Men,"" let's give due attention to this tablet, shall we? It's pretty awesome. 
 
 Discovered by the archaeologist J.J. van Dijk in 1976, the tablet has since been lost without a trace, like so many single socks. Fortunately van Dijk left images behind, which researchers Michael Streck and Nathan Wasserman were able to analyze in a recent paper for the journal Iraq. Streck and Wasserman call the 6 riddles within ""wisdom literature,"" or aphorisms, but the structure of them isn't far off from our modern-day jokes. Due to the tablet's less-than-perfect state, the translations are a little patchy. Still, behold, an alcohol reference: 
 
 In your mouth and your teeth, constantly stared at you, the measuring vessel of your lord. 
 
 (-What is it?) Beer. 
 
 True, it's not what you'd call a knee-slapper, but ""your teeth,"" according to Streck and Wasserman, could also be read as ""your urine."" And everyone knows ""urine"" is ""funny."" Moving on, a twosome concerning those twin foci of late-night talk show hosts: sex and politics. Number one: 
 
 The deflowered (girl) did not become pregnant. 
 
 The undeflowered (girl) became pregnant (-What is it?) Auxiliary forces. 
 
 This one is ""unclear,"" according to Streck and Wasserman. We call it ""surrealist.' 
 
 And: 
 
 He gouged out the eye: 
 
 It is not the fate of a dead man. 
 
 He cut the throat: A dead man (-Who is it?) The governor. 
 
 This is apparently a reference to a Bayblonian governor's power to sentence people to death, according to Streck and W. In the comedy world, ""speaking truth to power"" commentary is often more direct than clever (see Louis CK's tweets about Sarah Palin), so...perhaps this is the Babylonian equivalent of a ""Politically Incorrect"" intro? Finally, we come to the jewel in the crown, a joke that foreshadows the greatest MTV show to star Wilmer Valderamma. Say hello to ""Yo' Mama: The Streets Of Babylon."" 
 
 ...of your mother is by the one who has intercourse with her. What/who is it? [No answer] 
 
 ""Your mother""? ""Intercourse""? If this isn't a precursor to the greatest take-down since McCarthy's ""You know how I know you're a communist?"" series, we'll eat our most ancient hat. Thank you Babylonian school system, for requiring your students to perform very important joke documentation for future generations.

 NEW YORK -- On the day the Yankees commemorated the 75th anniversary of the famous Lou Gehrig speech, it is clear Alex Rodriguez is truly the luckiest man on the face of the Earth ... Earth ... Earth. 
 
 It is also clear that for a guy with low testosterone, he sure has some set of onions. 
 
 [+] Enlarge Jim McIsaac/Getty Images A new book says MLB permitted Alex Rodriguez to use testosterone before his 2007 MVP season. A-Rod's big year led to another huge payday. 
 
 In some ways, the A-Rod story is an inspiring one, the tale of a man beset with crippling physical disabilities -- in addition to his testosterone deficiency, he also was born with congenital deformities in both hips, according to his orthopedic surgeon -- and yet was able to rise to a level of success in Major League Baseball achieved by only a handful of (presumably healthy) men who came before him. 
 
 And he did it all with the help and blessing of MLB, which in its benevolence took pity on this poor specimen and helped him live his dream. 
 
 If anyone should be angered by this heartwarming tale, it is the New York Yankees, because without that help, A-Rod might not have won that 2007 MVP award, nor would he have had the gumption to opt out of his 10-year, $252 million deal at the seven-year mark to seek an extension and a raise. 
 
 Then again, maybe he would have. 
 
 That is, of course, if the Yankees didn't already know about it. 
 
 If nothing else, this latest A-Rod tale -- that he requested, and received, permission from MLB to use testosterone and a female fertility drug called clomiphene citrate (Clomid), both banned performance-enhancers, on the grounds that his body was deficient in both substances -- only reminds us of how this man's hubris truly knows no limits. (Unless, of course, he was trying to get pregnant, too.) 
 
 For one thing, if he was deficient in testosterone, it was likely because prior (undetected) steroid use had curtailed his body's ability to produce its own. 
 
 For another, when the bill finally came due in 2013 in the form of the Biogenesis investigation that ultimately cost him a one-year suspension -- and $25 million of that raise he had extorted out of the Yankees based on a PED-tainted season -- he had the nerve to appeal the decision, publicly smear his benefactors-turned-accusers, and file lawsuits against everyone in sight. 
 
 Of course, there are no good guys in this tale, told in a forthcoming book, ""Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era"" by authors Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts. 
 
 For one thing, the players' association did everything it could to resist tougher steroid testing for as long as possible, and MLB went along with it. 
 
 For another, none of the players publicly seemed to have a problem with illegally jacked teammates, as long as they were helping their teams win and helping them collect playoff checks. 
 
 In fact, if there are 750 major league baseball players, you can imagine there were 750 requests for what baseball terms TUEs -- therapeutic use exemptions -- for everything from testosterone to Ritalin and Adderall. Because as we have recently learned, a disproportionate number of professional baseball players suffer from attention deficit disorder, too. 
 
 The fact that Alex Rodriguez was granted one of those TUEs is not only comically ironic, but deeply embarrassing to baseball. 
 
 Already, he had tested positive for steroid use in survey testing conducted in 2003, an offense for which there was no penalty since Congress had yet to pressure MLB and the MLBPA into adopting the current Joint Drug Agreement. 
 
 And there had been suspicions about Rodriguez throughout his career; by his own admission, he began using steroids in 2001, after signing what was then the largest contract in sports history, for fear of not being able to live up to the expectations. (Testosterone can be used to treat performance anxiety.) 
 
 So while it may be hard to believe that a reputable doctor would diagnose low-T and prescribe testosterone to a man with the body, physical abilities, and history of Alex Rodriguez, that is precisely what happened. 
 
 A North Carolina physician, Bryan W. Smith, approved the medical exemption. Smith was the IPA -- independent program administrator -- appointed jointly by MLB and the MLBPA, but supposedly not answerable to either. 
 
 Requests for comment from Dr. Smith on Wednesday were rejected, and all calls were referred to MLB's public relations department. 
 
 None of MLB's officials would comment on the record, but the league did release a statement distancing itself from the process and never mentioning Alex Rodriguez by name. 
 
 A baseball source refused to tell ESPNNewYork.com whether the Yankees were aware of A-Rod's medical exemption when they tore up his old contract and replaced it with a new 10-year, $275 million deal that could add another $30 million in home run bonuses. But clearly, they liked whatever he was doing and weren't really interested in how he was doing it. 
 
 In fact, the only way this information even came to light was because it was introduced into evidence at A-Rod's grievance hearing in his 162-game suspension, of which a confidential copy of the testimony ""somehow'' found its way into the hands of the authors. 
 
 None of it is going to matter, of course. 
 
 Alex Rodriguez winds up losing $25 million in salary for this year, which is money he was only due under the new contract, which was based on tainted numbers. 
 
 He is free to come back to the Yankees next year, and in fact has every intention of doing so. 
 
 Even if, at 40 -- the age he will turn on July 27 of next season -- he can't put up the kind of numbers he did in the Golden Age of 2007, he is still entitled to some $61 million of Hal Steinbrenner's money. 
 
 And with a little bit of luck, he will still hit enough home runs to collect on at least one, and maybe even two, of those $6 million bonus checks. 
 
 On the day that we commemorate the tragedy of a man who only thought he was lucky, it is only fitting to take a moment and marvel at one who truly has been. ||||| ""Blood Sport"" is about far more than Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis, and PED's. It's also about a culture in sports that promotes cheating for the sake of self-aggrandisement and the almighty dollar. Thoroughly researched by authors Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts, ""Blood Sport"" offers a blow-by-blow description of the history of the events that eventually led to the suspensions of some 15 Major League ballplayers, most notably the season-long (2014) suspension of Alex Rodriguez. Although a well-documented, detailed, and accurate account of these events, the book reads more like a piece of well-written fiction, in which intrigue, back-alley deals, robberies, and double-crossing all play their role in bringing these suspensions about. In the end, no one emerges as a hero, certainly not the players who were guilty of trying to circumvent baseball's ban on PED's, nor shady characters such as Tony Bosch, whose clinic supplied players with various banned substances, nor, for that matter, the agents of Major League Baseball, whose heavy-handed tactics, payoffs to witnesses, and legally questionable practices display the same win-at-all-costs mentality that has led so many players to take drugs to gain an edge over their competitors. 
 
 
 
 Not only does ""Blood Sport"" provide a detailed account of the story that culminated in the suspensions of Rodriguez and others, but it also goes beyond professional baseball. Although of secondary importance to the main story, we read of the use of PED's at the high school and college level as well (particularly at the University of Miami, which is located right across the street from Tony Bosch's clinic), and the use of such substances in other sports is also noted. 
 
 
 
 Elfrink and Garcia-Roberts are to be commended for their thorough research and their objective reporting. Although they make moral judgments from time to time, they do not let these get in the way of the story or color the reader's perception. Their background as newspaper reporters has stood them in good stead in making the finished product such a fascinating read. ||||| The following is an excerpt from Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era, by Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts.

 As had been the case in the years after he joined the Rangers in 2001, Alex Rodriguez’s first four seasons in the Bronx were marked by incredible individual statistics and disappointing team results. The Yankees failed to make the World Series from 2004 to ’07 -- but Rodriguez did win the second and third MVP awards of his career, in ’05 and ’07. The latter year was particularly impressive: He hit 54 home runs, including the 500th of his career, becoming, at 32, the youngest player to reach that milestone. He also drove in 156 runs and scored 143 -- both career highs—and led the majors with a 1.067 OPS. It all added up to an easy choice when voters filled out their American League MVP ballots. Rodriguez received 26 of 28 first-place votes. 
 
 What hasn’t been reported until now is that Rodriguez won that MVP with permission from Major League Baseball to use performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). 
 
 From his junior year of high school there had been suspicions -- and, in the case of his 2003 MVP season, proof by way of a failed steroid test that came to light six years later -- that Rodriguez used PEDs. In August 2013, Major League Baseball suspended Rodriguez for 211 games for multiple violations of its PED policy, a decision he appealed last fall. A transcript of a confidential arbitration hearing obtained by the authors of this book suggests that Rodriguez put up those monster numbers in 2007 with the help of a powerful anabolic steroid. 
 
 Under baseball’s performance-enhancing drug policy, players can apply for a so-called therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to take certain medical substances otherwise banned by MLB. A doctor appointed by both sides—the independent program administrator (IPA) -- reviews all applications. Baseball also has an expert medical panel to advise the IPA. If an exemption is granted, the player cannot be punished for using that substance. The exemption is good for one year. 
 
 Before the 2007 season, Rodriguez asked for permission to use testosterone, which has been banned by baseball since 2003. The IPA in '07 was Bryan W. Smith, a High Point, N.C., physician. (Baseball did not yet have the advisory medical panel.) On Feb. 16, 2007, two days before Rodriguez reported to spring training, Smith granted the exemption, allowing Rodriguez to use testosterone all season. 
 
 The exemption was revealed in a transcript of Rodriguez’s fall 2013 grievance hearing. During that proceeding, MLB entered into evidence several exemptions applied for by Rodriguez during his Yankees tenure. In his testimony, MLB chief operating officer Rob Manfred called testosterone “the mother of all anabolics” and said that exemptions for the substance are “very rare,” partly because “some people who have been involved in this field feel that with a young male, healthy young male, the most likely cause of low testosterone requiring this type of therapy would be prior steroid abuse.” 
 
 Statistics requested in 2008 by Massachusetts congressman John Tierney as part of a government probe into baseball’s PED problem reveal how rare testosterone exemptions are. In 2007, of the 1,354 players subjected to testing, 111 were granted a TUE. Only two, apparently including Rodriguez, received an exemption for “androgen deficiency medications,” the category that would include testosterone. The other exemptions that year involved treatments for baldness, hypertension and -- predominantly -- attention deficit disorder. The alarmingly high number of exemptions for the latter was Tierney’s main concern. “I think it begs a question: Are people using this as a loophole?” said Tierney. “Are they taking these because they are perceived as a performance-enhancing drug, or do they have a legitimate medicinal purpose?” 
 
 ***** 
 
 During the 2007 World Series, as the Red Sox were sweeping the Rockies for their second championship in four seasons, Rodriguez hijacked the headlines by opting out of his contract with the Yankees. Six weeks later, the team signed him to a 10-year deal that guaranteed him $275 million to stay in pinstripes until '17. In addition, the Yankees added $6 million-a-pop clauses for each all-time home run leader he passed, starting with Willie Mays at 660 and ending with Barry Bonds at 762. 
 
 Even after securing his latest windfall, Rodriguez wasn’t done seeking exemptions that allowed him to boost his testosterone levels with banned substances. In January 2008, according to the arbitration hearing transcripts, he requested two exemptions. Rodriguez wanted to use clomiphene citrate (Clomid), a drug designed to increase fertility in women. It is also prescribed to men who suffer from hypogonadism -- a testosterone deficiency -- to block the production of estrogen in their bodies. The drug is popular with bodybuilders at the end of steroid cycles because it can also stimulate the body to make more testosterone. 
 
 Rodriguez also requested permission to use human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone known as HCG, popularly -- and misguidedly -- used for weight loss and also to produce testosterone. Both HCG and clomiphene citrate were banned with the 2008 season. Smith approved Rodriguez’s use of clomiphene citrate that year. The exemption for HCG was denied, but according to the transcript of Manfred’s arbitration testimony, that denial was “more of a recordkeeping thing than anything else.” Rodriguez’s physician communicated with Smith, and “in their back-and-forth the physician informed Dr. Smith that the player was no longer using [HCG],” Manfred testified. 
 
 With permission to use clomiphene citrate, Rodriguez was once again one of the few players allowed to take medicine designed to increase testosterone levels. In 2008, three major leaguers were granted exemptions to take drugs to treat hypogonadism. In fact, from the 2006 season through 2013, only 15 were granted for androgen deficiencies and hypogonadism, the conditions that under MLB’s drug policy could require a medical testosterone boost. 
 
 By 2008, Rodriguez had played at least a significant portion of his career -- including, at a minimum, two of this three MVP seasons -- with the apparent help of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. He was by far the richest man in MLB, which was finally coming to terms with its steroid problem. Rodriguez had a guaranteed contract until the age of 42. The only wise thing to do would be to ride out that contract while continuing to apply for dubious exemptions but staying on the right side of baseball law. 
 
 But Rodriguez wasn’t the type for laurel-resting. 
 
 ***** 
 
 The handshake that was both Tony Bosch’s biggest break and the beginning of his downfall came late on a sweltering night in Tampa. It was July 30, 2010, and Bosch was flanked by a friend, Jorge (Oggi) Velazquez. To the ballplayer they both called Cacique, or boss, they could have seemed a comical couple as they walked into his hotel room: Velazquez, a short, hard-eyed former liquor-store owner from South Florida with an intense temper, Bosch a twitchy, ingratiating character everybody called Dr. T. 
 
 This guy is the best at what he does, Velazquez promised Rodriguez, laying the salesmanship on thick. He can provide you with everything you need. 
 
 If the ballplayer had any misgivings, he didn’t show it. Instead, Bosch later said, the first words out of Rodriguez’s mouth were, “What were you giving Manny Ramirez?” 
 
 The inquiry was rooted in both envy and concern. In 2008, Ramirez, who was traded from the Red Sox to the Dodgers during the season, had at age 36 seemed to rejuvenate his health and his swing, playing in all but nine regular-season games and almost doubling his home run output from the previous season, from 20 to 37. 
 
 Of course, in 2009 Ramirez had been nabbed by baseball’s PED police -- he had been caught taking HCG and served a 50-game suspension. Bosch’s name had surfaced in the investigation: His father, Dr. Pedro Bosch, had written the HCG prescription for Ramirez, who did not have a therapeutic-use exemption from MLB. 
 
 Bosch explained to Rodriguez that Ramirez had been busted because he hadn’t followed instructions. Getting caught, Bosch explained, was just Manny being Manny. It was “nearly impossible” for Bosch’s clients to test positive if they followed his protocol, he said. He would provide diagnostic blood testing, proper dosing and exact times at which the drugs should be administered. 
 
 Rodriguez was sold. Bosch detailed the testosterone creams, growth hormone and other substances he would be recommending, and they made plans to meet again. Soon afterward, the nickname Cacique started appearing in Bosch’s notebooks. Other times, Bosch wrote AER next to his new client’s phone number. The initials stood, of course, for Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez. 
 
 The 2010 meeting between Bosch and Rodriguez was one part luck, one part cosmic inevitability and all parts Yuri Sucart, a cousin of Rodriguez’s who was the slugger’s frequent companion and unofficial personal assistant. In 2009 or early '10, Sucart, who was friends with Velazquez, had a weight-loss consultation with Bosch. Sucart, who had carried around extra pounds since childhood, was nearing obesity in his late 40s. Bosch put Sucart on a pounds-shedding regimen of supplements and hormones. 
 
 Sucart doted on, and was employed by, his younger cousin. Sure, Rodriguez had burned Sucart by outing him as his steroid source to investigators and reporters when the slugger admitted in '09 to using PEDs from 2001-03 while with the Rangers. That cost Sucart access to MLB facilities, but it had also given him a salary bump. Sucart, who made under $60,000 from Rodriguez in 2006, saw his pay rise to $100,000 over the next five years. Rodriguez even had the Yankees make an extra 2009 championship ring, worth thousands of dollars, for his banned-from-MLB cousin. 
 
 During his treatments with Bosch, Sucart wore Yankees hats and shirts and that championship ring. He also told Bosch that he worked for Rodriguez. Among the supplements Bosch gave Sucart were his signature “gummies,” fast-acting testosterone troches. Sucart told Bosch that he thought the troches packed an “unbelievable sense of energy recovery.” He added that he had given one to Rodriguez and that his cousin “loved it because of its explosive effect,” according to the arbitration decision. 
 
 The long-distance flirtation between Bosch and Rodriguez lasted for months, until the superstar finally decided to take the plunge in late July 2010. After losing much of the '09 season to a hip injury, Rodriguez had stayed mostly healthy through the first four months of the '10 season. His numbers were unremarkable but steady: He had 14 home runs by the All-Star break, and against the Royals at Yankee Stadium on July 22, he swatted his 599th homer. Five days shy of his 35th birthday, he was about to become the youngest player to join the 600 club. 
 
 When he next came to the plate, the umpire threw the pitcher a specially marked ball to deal to Rodriguez. Umps would continue to do this until he hit his next home run; the mark would be used to authenticate the milestone ball. But Rodriguez didn’t homer in that game. In fact, he didn’t clear the fence through the three games remaining in the home stand. 
 
 The Yankees left for a seven-game road trip on July 26, and Rodriguez failed to connect during four games in Cleveland. For any other hitter, a two-week home run drought would barely register. But what began as a celebratory chase was turning torturous. As sellout crowds followed his every game, Rodriguez complained that stadiums of flashing cameras on each swing never let him forget the looming milestone. 
 
 Even without the power drought, Rodriguez might have hooked up with Bosch eventually. Despite his enormous talent, Rodriguez spent his career seeking a synthetic edge, especially when struggling to meet mile-high expectations. Taken as a whole, Rodriguez’s greatest baseball achievements were inseparable from his use of PEDs. Now his body was corroding due to age. But all he needed was one more push to knock down those historic milestones and place himself among the all-time greats. 
 
 The call came to Velazquez in late July, and he relayed the inquiry to Bosch: Rodriguez wanted to talk about becoming a client. They met at a Tampa hotel following a road loss to the Rays; Rodriguez, still stuck on 599, had gone 0-for-4. Sucart, who despite MLB’s ban had remained Rodriguez’s shadow, joined his cousin, Velazquez, and Bosch in the hotel room. 
 
 The foursome met often. In early August, they gathered again, this time at Rodriguez’s $30,000-per-month apartment on Central Park West, a building that Denzel Washington and Sting also called home. Bosch insisted on drawing blood to design an appropriate protocol for Rodriguez. He then flew back to Miami with Rodriguez’s plasma, knowing the vial contained the opportunity of his career. 
 
 Bosch consulted with a urologist, according to the arbitration decision. He also had lengthy conversations about Rodriguez’s medical history with Sucart. Bosch dreamed up an elaborate doping protocol that would take Rodriguez into December, built around testosterone, HGH, and growth-hormone-producing peptides. Less than a week later, Bosch traveled to see Rodriguez in New York; his luggage was packed with preloaded syringes. 
 
 On Aug. 4, Rodriguez finally connected on a pitch and made a sold-out Yankee Stadium erupt. Home run No. 600 flew into Monument Park, the museum beyond centerfield honoring Yankees greats. As he rounded the bases, Rodriguez lifted his palms coyly. His teammates streamed out of the dugout to congratulate him, and he took a curtain call for the roaring crowd. 
 
 At that point, fans knew only about Rodriguez’s positive steroid test back in 2003. That was still enough to mark Rodriguez forever as a cheater. But this moment was a step toward redemption and leadership in the eyes of the fans and his team. The previous October, he had finally earned a championship ring. Now No. 600 was out of the way. 
 
 Rodriguez wasn’t on Bosch’s regimen yet. But even as he circled the bases, and after the game as his colleagues were praising him for succeeding without steroids -- “That’s a chapter of his life I think he’s turned the page on,” said hitting coach Kevin Long -- Rodriguez knew he’d found the man who would help energize the latter stage of his career. He was one week past his 35th birthday, and he was determined to collect every one of those milestone bonuses in his contract. He wanted to be the lone member of the 800 home run club, Bosch would later say. To do that would take a nature-defying power surge in his late 30s of the sort Barry Bonds had pioneered. 
 
 On Aug. 14— -- even days after his down-to-the-minute regimen with Bosch began -- Rodriguez slammed three home runs in Kansas City. Afterward, he admitted for the first time that his lagging power production had bothered him. “I haven’t really hit for any power this year, so it’s been frustrating,” he said. “Being stuck at 599 was really a microcosm of what’s happened all year. I’ve been able to drive in runs and hit some doubles here and there, but overall I’ve hit for no power.” 
 
 But now, Tony Bosch had a believer.

125,"President Barack Obama's nominee to be general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency indicated at her confirmation hearing Tuesday that she opposes giving members of Congress access to Justice Department legal memoranda that govern CIA activities such as interrogation and drone strikes. 
 
 The nominee who rebuffed Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, Caroline Krass, has served as a top lawyer in the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel and at times as the acting director of that office. 
 
 Feinstein opened her questioning of Krass by asking her if she would commit to sharing OLC opinions with the Senate panel. 
 
 ""This isn't just idle curiousity. It is really to understand the direction and rules under which certain programs operate,"" Feinstein said. ""We have found that these opinions are actually indispensable to effective oversight."" She said that an inspector general report found the CIA waterboarded 9/11 suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a manner inconsistent with the OLC opinion on waterboarding. 
 
 Krass responded initially by saying she was committed to making sure senators on the panel understood the legal framework CIA is working in, but she stopped short of committing to share the written opinions. 
 
 ""I do believe the committee needs to fully udnerstand the legal basis for any activities, intelligence acitvities, in which the CIA is engaged, including covert action,"" Krass said. 
 
 Feinstein was unsatisfied and pressed Krass for a ""yes or no"" answer on access to the opinions. What the senator got sounded pretty much like a ""no."" 
 
 ""The OLC opinions represent predecisional, confidential legal advice that’s been provided. Protecting confidentiality of that legal advice preserves space for their to be a full and frank discussion among clients, policymakers and their lawyers within the executive branch and really furthers the rule of law and allows for effective functioning of the executive branch,"" Krass said, repeating her offer to help the committee understand the administration's legal thinking and saying she has ""an almost unique ability to do that."" 
 
 ""I think we do understand it,"" Feinstein replied. ""I think it has been explained to us but every OLC opinion has been a fight to obtain and we have obtained very few of them, only those that relate to U.S. citizens."" 
 
 Feinstein didn't immediate explain what she meant, but she may have been referring to a battle the committee had earlier this year to get opinions on targeting terrorism suspects for deadly force in drone attacks. The confirmation of CIA Director John Brennan was held up for a time until President Barack Obama agreed to share legal memos on the subject with Congressional committees. 
 
 Joining Feinstein, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she was ""troubled"" by Krass's answer. Collins noted that the Office of Legal Counsel often releases unclassified opinions. 
 
 ""They go through an extensive review process....We try to publish opinions when we can to promote transparency,"" Krass said, before saying there would be some merit to considering that for classified legal opinions. ""I do think it's worth exploring whether there could be some kind of similar process with respect to classified OLC opinions."" 
 
 Pressed by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Krass said she does not believe Congress has a right to Office of Legal Counsel opinions. 
 
 ""I do not think so, as a general matter,"" she said. 
 
 Last month, the Justice Department pressed a federal appeals court to preserve the Office of Legal Counsel's ability to keep legal opinions from the public. 
 
 Collins also raised a 2011 episode in which Obama rejected a legal interpretation advanced by Krass and the Pentagon's top lawyer at the time, Jeh Johnson, which would have curtailed U.S. operations in Libya. Obama sided with his White House counsel and State Department lawyers in deciding to continue the operation. 
 
 In an indirect way, Collins suggested Krass might have quit if she thought what the president proposed doing was illegal. 
 
 ""What I don't like seeing is the administration shopping around until it gets a legal opinion with which it agrees and that seems to have happened in the case of Libya,"" Collins said. 
 
 UPDATE (Tuesday, 4:05 P.M.): This post has been updated with the exchange with Levin.

Krass to be the C.I.A.’s top lawyer, “this raises fundamental questions about why a review the C.I.A. conducted internally years ago — and never provided to the committee — is so different from the C.I.A.’s formal response to the committee study.”

 The agency responded to the committee report with a vigorous 122-page rebuttal that challenged both the Senate report’s specific facts and its overarching conclusions. John O. Brennan, one of Mr. Obama’s closest advisers before taking over the C.I.A. this year — and who denounced the interrogation program during his confirmation hearing — delivered the agency’s response to the Intelligence Committee himself. 
 
 It is unclear what the agency specifically concluded in its internal review. 
 
 Mr. Udall, whose public criticisms of the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of telephone data has raised his profile in Congress and won him praise from privacy advocates, said he would not support Ms. Krass’s nomination until the C.I.A. provided more information to the committee about the interrogation program. 
 
 Ms. Krass did not respond directly to Mr. Udall’s statements about the internal C.I.A. review. Dean Boyd, an agency spokesman, said the agency was “aware of the committee’s request and will respond appropriately.”

 Mr. Boyd said that the C.I.A. agreed with a number of the conclusions of the voluminous Senate investigative report, but found “significant errors in the study.”

 “C.I.A. and committee staff have had extensive dialogue on this issue, and the agency is prepared to work with the committee to determine the best way forward on potential declassification,” he said.

 Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is the Intelligence Committee’s chairwoman, said recently that her committee would soon vote to adopt the report’s executive summary and conclusion, which would then be subject to a formal declassification process before it was publicly released. 
 
 Republican members of the committee, angry about what they see as a biased and shoddy investigation by their Democratic colleagues, are planning to make public a rebuttal of their own. 
 
 The Senate report, which took years to complete and cost more than $40 million to produce, began as an attempt to document what was perhaps the most divisive of the Bush administration’s responses to the Sept. 11 attacks. But it has since become enmeshed in the complex politics of the Obama administration.

 President Obama ended the detention program as one of his first acts in the Oval Office, and has repeatedly denounced the C.I.A.’s interrogation methods under the program. During a speech in May, he said that the United States had “compromised our basic values by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law.”

 And yet Mr. Obama has repeatedly resisted demands by human rights groups to seek prosecutions for the lawyers who approved the interrogation methods or the people who carried them out, and the White House has been mostly silent during the debate over the past year about declassifying the Senate report.

 For all his criticisms of the counterterrorism excesses during the Bush administration, Mr. Obama has put the C.I.A. at the center of his strategy to kill militant suspects in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. 
 
 Human rights groups have tried to pressure the White House to intervene to get the Senate report declassified.

 “Whether it’s stalling or concealing, the C.I.A. is trying to avoid reckoning with its past abuse,” said Naureen Shah of Amnesty International USA. “And that’s what makes declassifying the Senate’s report so crucial right now.” 
 
 Ms. Krass is a career government lawyer who works at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, the arm of the department that advises the White House on the legality of domestic and foreign policies.

 The office was particularly controversial during the Bush administration, when lawyers there wrote lengthy memos approving C.I.A. interrogation methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation, as well as signing off on the expansion of surveillance by the National Security Agency. 
 
 Under Mr. Obama, the office has approved other controversial practices, including the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric living in Yemen who was an American. Mr. Awlaki was killed in September 2011 by a C.I.A. drone strike, launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia.

 Much of Tuesday’s hearing was consumed by a debate about whether the White House should be forced to share Justice Department legal memos.

 Under polite but persistent questioning by members of both parties, Ms. Krass repeatedly said that while the two congressional intelligence committees need to “fully understand” the legal basis for C.I.A. activities, they were not entitled to see the Justice Department memos that provide the legal blueprint for secret programs. 
 
 The opinions “represent pre-decisional, confidential legal advice that has been provided,” she said, adding that the confidentiality of the legal advice was necessary to allow a “full and frank discussion amongst clients and policy makers and their lawyers within the executive branch.” 
 
 Senator Feinstein appeared unmoved. “Unless we know the administration’s basis for sanctioning a program, it is very hard to oversee it,” she said.

 Still, it is expected that the committee will vote to approve Ms. Krass.","– The Senate Intelligence Committee has formally requested a classified internal CIA study on its torture program, which lawmakers believe is deeply unflattering, the New York Times reports. Mark Udall revealed the existence of the report yesterday during a prickly hearing with Caroline Krass, President Obama's nominee for CIA general counsel. The Senate is fighting to declassify its own 6,300-page report on torture, which reportedly castigates the program. The CIA has blocked and vigorously rebutted that report, but lawmakers think its secret internal report backs it up. Krass didn't respond directly to Udall's questions about the report yesterday, and Udall says he won't support her nomination until the CIA opens up about torture. He might not be her only detractor, either.

126,"The young Vanier sex-trade worker thought she was going to die in the backseat of Jacques Rouschop’s pickup truck. 
 
 Jacques (Porkchop) Rouschop was a regular client, but this time was different, the 26-year-old woman told court at the career thief’s rape trial on Monday. It was the summer of 2013 — she doesn’t recall the date — and she said she was dope sick so she called Rouschop, 44, with the hope of getting a trick so she could buy either crack or fentanyl. She started doing dope at 11 and shooting up at 13. She’s been clean for six months, she told court. 
 
 She was dozing off in Rouschop’s pickup, she testified, as they drove to an industrial lot in Ottawa’s west end. 
 
 I couldn’t breathe. I was trying to get free but I couldn’t. … I thought I was going to die 
 
 “I knew him so I didn’t think anything bad would happen,” she testified. 
 
 It was supposed to be just oral sex, but he wanted more, she testified, and when she refused, he put her in a choke-hold and pressed his weight down on her. (The accused weighs around 350 pounds.) 
 
 “I couldn’t breathe. I was trying to get free but I couldn’t. … I thought I was going to die.” 
 
 She said she felt like she was drowning as she was raped from behind, she testified. 
 
 She says she also remembers him laughing. 
 
 “I felt completely hopeless and scared,” she said. 
 
 She then said she lost consciousness. 
 
 The woman is the second to testify against Rouschop, on trial for vicious sex attacks against them. 
 
 She told the jury — six women, six men — that Rouschop lost control and grabbed her pants, but under cross-examination by defence lawyer Natasha Calvinho she later said she wasn’t wearing pants. Instead, she said she was wearing stockings and a dress, and originally told police in 2013 that she had a jacket on, too, but said on Monday that she wasn’t wearing one. 
 
 There were other things she couldn’t remember — notably the size of Rouschop’s penis (measuring two inches erect, court has heard). “You just see so many of them … you just close your eyes and do it,” she replied. 
 
 I don’t remember the little details, but I know it happened 
 
 She also didn’t recall the accused’s umbilical hernia, around the size of a baseball. 
 
 Calvinho established that the complainant’s memory was bad when it came to ever-changing details. 
 
 But the witness shot back: ” I don’t remember the little details, but I know it happened.” 
 
 The trial continues Tuesday in courtroom No. 32 at the Elgin Street courthouse with Superior Court Justice Robert Smith presiding. ||||| The lawyer defending an alleged choker-rapist told a jury on Thursday that Jacques Rouschop couldn’t physically have committed the vicious sex crimes he’s accused of because his hernia “makes it too painful to have sex from behind, his stomach is too large and his penis is way, way too small.” 
 
 The first defence witness, a registered nurse, testified that she volunteered to take Rouschop’s measurements. She testified that Rouschop is five feet six inches tall, with a 66-inch waist, 31-inch thighs, and a one-inch penis, measuring approximately two inches when erect. The nurse also measured his umbilical hernia, saying it was 3.5 inches by 3.25 inches. (There is no way of knowing his exact weight because the scales at the Innes Road jail only go up to 320 pounds.) The court was also shown photographs of a naked Rouschop, who sat in the prisoner’s dock statue-still as some jurors took notes about his most intimate measurements. 
 
 Rouschop, a 44-year-old career thief, is on trial for the 2013 rape and choking of two Vanier woman. Both were sex trade workers and testified as Crown witnesses, recalling horrifying accounts of being attacked and choked until they blacked out in the backseat of Rouschop’s pickup truck in an unknown industrial lot. 
 
 Rouschop has pleaded not guilty, and on Thursday, his lawyer, Natasha Calvinho, launched his defence. 
 
 In her opening statements to the jury, Calvinho was quick to acknowledge that Rouschop has a criminal record that stretches four decades. 
 
 “He is far from a perfect man. He has made mistakes. He has committed crimes. He has spent time in jail and has a significant criminal record. He is known to local police and is someone who has been in and out of jail most of his adult life,” Calvinho told the jury. 
 
 She said that Rouschop couldn’t have committed the crimes as described in court because of his physical limitations. 
 
 The lawyer then addressed the elephant in the room. 
 
 “Due to his weight (around 400 pounds at the time) and his appearance, he will be the first to tell you that he has had a lot of trouble attracting members of the opposite sex, and that getting a woman’s attention, let alone having sex, was not something that happened very often for him. 
 
 “Despite his lack of physical attractiveness, he still had needs — sexual needs. And he turned to the services of sex trade workers,” Calvinho said. 
 
 The defence lawyer tried to portray Rouschop as more than a john, telling the jury that he cared about the Vanier sex trade workers, drove them around, bought them groceries, and “helped them anyway he could.” 
 
 The lawyer said that in the case of one of the complainants, it went far beyond a money-for-sex relationship. “He cared for her. He brought her to his home for sleepovers and dinners with his mom,” Calvinho said. 
 
 The lawyer also told the jury that it is Rouschop’s firm belief that Ottawa detectives investigating the unsolved 2013 killing of sex trade worker Amy Paul targeted him because they suspected he killed her. 
 
 “He believes he is the subject of a witch hunt,” Calvinho told the jury. 
 
 The jury has heard that detectives working the Paul case went to great lengths to successfully secure formal statements from the sex trade workers against Rouschop. The charges — two counts of aggravated sexual assault and choking — that Rouschop is on trial for now were yielded from the investigation into Paul’s killing, which remains unsolved. Ottawa police publicly linked Rouschop to Paul’s homicide in December 2013 but have never charged him. They also searched his home for Paul’s shoes, pants and cell phone, according to records obtained by the Citizen. 
 
 Rouschop was charged with rape and choking less than 24 hours after Ottawa police announced a $50,000 reward in the unsolved Paul homicide investigation in December 2013. Both women in this case testified that they didn’t initially want to come forward but did so after police strongly urged them to, court has heard. They also testified that they didn’t come forward because of the reward, which remains unclaimed.

 www.twitter.com/crimegarden ||||| Jacques “Porkchop” Rouschop has waited almost three years to defend himself against rape-and-choking charges, and starting Thursday morning, an Ottawa jury will start hearing defence evidence — including the “remarkably small” size of his penis — that he hopes will finally clear his name. 
 
 Rouschop, 44, is on trial for the 2013 rape and choking of two Vanier women who prostituted themselves to feed severe crack and fentanyl addictions. They have both testified against Rouschop, telling the jury horrifying accounts of being choked to the point of unconsciousness in the backseat of his pickup truck. 
 
 Both women told the jury that they are now clean, one for six months, after saying they kicked the habit on their own. 
 
 One woman revealed on the stand that she didn’t think she was raped. The other woman testified that she was raped by Rouschop, a longtime client who she said suddenly lost control. She told court she doesn’t recall the date or where they were parked and the details of her account have changed. 
 
 She originally told police that she was wearing a jacket, but told court this week that she wasn’t, and she testified that she was wearing pants, the ones Rouschop allegedly pulled down, only to later say that she was wearing a skirt or a dress with stockings. But she was firm under cross-examination, and said that while she doesn’t remember those details, she definitely remembers that she was raped and that she felt she was going to die in that backseat, somewhere in the city’s west end. 
 
 Neither wanted to file a report against Rouschop, for reasons ranging from humiliation to fear of reprisals. The jury — six women, six men — has heard that Ottawa police detectives investigating the unsolved 2013 homicide of Amy Paul, a 27-year-old Vanier sex-trade worker, went to great lengths to secure formal complaints, and later their testimony, from the sex-trade workers. 
 
 Rouschop was charged less than 24 hours after Ottawa police announced a $50,000 reward in the unsolved homicide of Amy Paul. Both have testified that the reward had nothing to do with them coming forward, which they did months before it was publicly posted. 
 
 Under cross-examination by Rouschop’s defence lawyer Natasha Calvinho, neither complainant could recall that the accused’s penis is “pretty darn small,” measuring around two inches erect. 
 
 The nurse who measured Rouschop’s penis at the Innes Road jail is expected to be the first defence witness to take the stand Thursday. 
 
 The rape-and-choking trial has been overshadowed by the Amy Paul investigation because Rouschop is not just any accused. In a rare move, Ottawa police publicly linked Rouschop to the Amy Paul case in December 2013, announcing that the rape charges now before the courts were yielded specifically from the homicide investigation. Police told reporters they wanted to question him. (Police also executed a search warrant at his home with the hopes of finding Paul’s pants, shoes and cell phone.) 
 
 Despite an intense and expensive investigation, Rouschop has never been charged in the Amy Paul killing — nor has anyone else. 
 
 Rouschop has maintained his innocence in all of this, and denies knowing Amy Paul, let alone killing her. He also says he didn’t choke or rape the two women now testifying against him.

127,"Bed bugs are bed bad. People’s entire lives have been overturned by these (increasingly common) blood-sucking, itch-inducing pests. Thankfully, they’re not disease vectors, but I would rather not share my home with a roommate who wants to eat me, thank you very much. 
 
 Scientists have noticed an expansion in bed bug cases across the world, in no small part due to increased international travel. But one team wanted to know how the bed bugs managed to hitch a ride, and how to prevent the spread. It turns out that part of the answer lies with the dirty laundry inside your travel bag. 
 
 Advertisement 
 
 “There are a lot of good studies out there focused on trying to understand how bed bugs are attracted to humans and how they get around apartment blocks, but no one has really talked about how they get into the house in the first place,” study author William Hentley from the University of Sheffield in the UK told Gizmodo. “Stopping people from bringing bed bugs home can be a big step in preventing them spreading throughout the world.” 
 
 Scientists already know that human odor attracts bed bugs, though not which chemicals in the odor specifically. But for the newest study, researchers prepared a mock bedroom with laundry bags containing clean and dirty clothes—in other words, there were no humans in the room. The critters were “twice as likely to aggregate on bags containing soiled clothes compared to bags containing clean clothes,” according to the paper published today in the journal Scientific Reports. Contrary to the researchers’ hypothesis, the amount of carbon dioxide in the room did not affect their results—the CO2 source would represent a human, since some bugs like mosquitos are specifically attracted to the carbon dioxide you exhale. 
 
 These results were enough to convince the researchers that bed bugs could travel throughout the world by hitching a ride in luggage containing dirty clothes. 
 
 Advertisement 
 
 As a caveat, this was an experimental room and not real life, said both Hentley and Toby Fountain, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Uppsala in Sweden who was not involved in the study. But still, said Fountain, the authors “demonstrate a striking pattern that bags containing clothes with human odor were more frequently used as refuges than those without. This result emphases the importance of making sure luggage and other belongings are made as inaccessible to bed bugs as possible when staying in increased risk places, for example by making sure bags are fully closed and secured and kept away from the bed.” Hentley agreed with this advice. 
 
 So there you have it. When traveling to possibly bed bug-contaminated locations—like, say, that sketchy-seeming hotel—keep your luggage on metal racks (bed bugs don’t like crawling on metal, said Hentley) or put your whole suitcase in a plastic bag to avoid picking up the horrors that are bed bugs. 
 
 [Scientific Reports] ||||| In the absence of a human host, bed bugs were twice as likely to aggregate on bags containing soiled clothes compared to bags containing clean clothes. Contrary to our predictions, elevated CO 2 did not affect this result. We did not observe bed bugs aggregating on the side of the room with the CO 2 source, but instead found an increased likelihood of bed bugs leaving their refuge. Our data are most consistent with the notion that elevated CO 2 initiates host-seeking behaviour. This is similar to findings in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae where very small increases in CO 2 concentration stimulate host-seeking behaviour19, 20. The position of the CO 2 source in a closed room above and away from the bed bug release point means directional cues as to the source of CO 2 may have been difficult for bed bugs to discern and so it is not possible to conclude whether or not the lack of aggregation on that side of the room suggests a lack of attraction to CO 2 . Many commercial bed bug monitors use CO 2 in conjunction with thermal and/or chemical cues, and claim higher catch rates than monitors without CO 2 . Our results suggest that any increase in capture rate in such devices10, 21 might be caused by increased activity rather than, or in addition to, increased attractiveness. 
 
 The smallest bottle-neck through which a new bed bug population can pass, and therefore the most likely passive (i.e. long-range) dispersal phenotype, is a single mated adult female5. There is some experimental evidence for a female ‘disperser’: work using small arenas and shorter time scales found that females were more active than males22 and more likely to disperse from aggregations with a 1:1 sex ratio23. By contrast, our study showed there was no significant sex difference in the number of insects found on bags with, or without, human smell (Table 1a). Since dispersal from the refuge may be initiated by hunger, we would expect females (with their higher metabolic rate24) to start host-seeking before males and potentially to do so more often. However, over longer periods, such as that used in this study, males and females are both likely to experience hunger and disperse from the refuge. Our design does not enable us to resolve this issue. 
 
 Our results do show that bags containing soiled clothes were significantly more attractive to bed bugs than identical bags containing clean clothes. Human odour is a known cue for host-seeking bed bugs11, but until now studies have focussed on how these cues determine the attractiveness of a sleeping host. Our results show that bed bugs will move to, and aggregate on, soiled clothing in the absence of a host. Bed bugs can sense 104 different volatiles16 found in the odorant profile of human skin25. Many of these volatiles are likely to evaporate from ‘soiled’ clothes for some time after they have been worn, removed and/or stored. We propose that residual human odour on soiled clothes acts as an elicitor of host-seeking or host-seeking-like behaviours, and that cues such as heat9 or elevated CO 2 may facilitate the activation and sensitivity of such host-seeking behaviour. Consequently, soiled clothing left in an open suitcase, or left on the floor, of an infested room is likely to attract bed bugs. When packed into the suitcase, they will accompany their host back home. 
 
 Our results show that over a period of several days bed bugs are attracted to, and remain on, soiled clothing: this provides a biologically realistic mechanism that underpins passive, long-range dispersal in bed bugs. The advent of relatively frequent, short-stay holidays in locations long distances from the hosts’ residence will facilitate the proposed mechanism of dispersal. Careful management of holiday clothing may be an important strategy in the prevention of bringing home bed bugs. ||||| Bed bugs love your stinky laundry. Here’s how to keep them away 
 
 On the surface, bed bugs seem ill-equipped for world domination: They can’t fly, jump, or swim; they can survive only on blood; and the world’s foremost apex predators—humans—want them all dead. Yet the parasitic arthropods have recently undergone what scientists are calling a “rapid global expansion,” taking over new territories and growing in number and range. And according to a new study, their globetrotting is made possible in part by an unusual form of transportation: our stinky laundry. 
 
 “It’s a good study,” says Richard Cooper, an entomologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, who was not involved with the work. He says it makes sense that the bugs are attracted to human odors, even on clothing. 
 
 Though they aren’t known to transmit disease, bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) can leave behind itchy bites and cause allergic reactions. In the middle of the 20th century, the pests had been largely eradicated from large parts of the developed world, but bans on effective pesticides in the 1990s, along with cheap air travel, have allowed the bugs to come creeping back. 
 
 Unlike ticks or lice, the apple seed–sized bed bugs aren’t travelers: They don’t stay on their hosts for long, and they rarely leave the beds and couches where they feast. So how were they getting onto planes? 
 
 “To me, hitchhiking seemed like the best explanation,” says William Hentley, an entomologist at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom. “That then led me to this question of whether they’re attracted to our clothes and the smell of humans.” 
 
 To figure out whether the bugs were indeed stowing away in our laundry and luggage, Hentley and his colleagues tested whether the insects were attracted to soiled clothing. They set a cage full of bed bugs in the middle of a room and placed two cotton bags at equal distances—one filled with clean clothes and the other filled with dirty socks and T-shirts collected from volunteers. The researchers released the bed bugs from the cage and let them wander freely for 96 hours. 
 
 At the end of the experiment, about twice as many bugs were attracted to the dirty clothes as to clean ones, the team reports today in Scientific Reports . That jives with prior experiments that have shown that bed bugs can smell more than 100 compounds produced by human skin—many of which could easily linger on clothes for multiple days, the researchers say. 
 
 They also tested whether increases in carbon dioxide—long thought to signal a nearby meal—made the bugs more or less likely to go for the smelly clothes. When added to room, the gas seemed to trigger foraging behavior, but the bugs weren’t any more likely to go for the dirty clothes than they were initially. That suggests that carbon dioxide prompts the bugs to forage, but it doesn’t help them home in on the smelly laundry, the team concludes. 
 
 So what can you do to keep the six-legged parasites out of your suitcase when you travel? Hentley is careful to point out that he hasn’t studied these techniques scientifically, but he recommends simply putting your bags up on the metal luggage racks in a hotel room, because the bugs can’t climb up smooth surfaces. If no such rack is to be found, keeping your soiled garments in an airtight bag should help mask the smell. But bear in mind that if you’ve previously put dirty clothes in your luggage, you might need to wrap up your whole suitcase, he says. 
 
 Cooper agrees that plastic bags might work, but he doesn’t use them himself. “The biggest thing is not keeping your luggage on the bed,” he says. Another option: putting your bags into a portable heating chamber whenever you get home and washing and drying your clothes on high heat. “Heat is the Achilles heel of the bed bug,” Cooper says.","– Nobody wants to bring home bedbugs after being on the road, and now scientists have some practical advice on how to avoid that fate. A new study in Scientific Reports shows that the little critters are drawn to the scent of dirty laundry, and the lead author translates that into traveling tips. For starters, put your luggage up on metal racks in a hotel room because bedbugs won't be able to climb up the smooth surface, says entomologist William Hentley of the UK's University of Sheffield, per Gizmodo. You might also store your dirty clothes in a separate airtight bag. If the hotel has no metal racks, consider storing your entire suitcase in a plastic bag, which may seem like a pain, but nothing compared to the chore of ridding your home of bedbugs. ""Soiled clothing left in an open suitcase, or left on the floor, of an infested room is more likely to attract bed bugs,"" the authors write. ""When packed into a suitcase, they will accompany their host back home."" They figured this out by unleashing bedbugs in a room and leaving them be for 96 hours. Roughly twice as many bugs ended up in a cotton bag filled with dirty laundry as opposed to a bag of clean clothes. A Rutgers entomologist who wasn't involved with the study tells Science it's legit and offers some advice of his own. ""The biggest thing is not keeping your luggage on the bed,"" he says. Travelers also should wash and then dry clothes at the highest temperature upon returning home, he adds, because ""heat is the Achilles heel of the bedbug.""

128,"AP Photo Hillary in bold: Hillvetica typeface goes viral 
 
 Hillary Clinton has been a a first lady, a senator, and a diplomat, but this week she transformed into a whole new political form: a font. 
 
 Graphic designer Rick Wolff designed a font based on the newly-launched Hillary for America campaign’s logo, a blue ‘H’ with a red arrow pointing rightwards. 
 
 Story Continued Below 
 
 He tweeted the font out Monday, dubbing it “Hillary Bold” and later “Hillvetica” — a play on the Swiss typeface Helvetica which has become subtly omnipresent across the world since launching in the 1950s. 
 
 “Because, America. Now you too can announce!” Wolff quipped in a Tweet. 
 
 Already, in the absence of a Microsoft Word-compatible version, the Washington Post has launched a Hillvetica slogan-generator and legions of online political junkies have created their own slogans. 
 
 Hillary Clinton spent the day in Iowa, where her campaign did not immediately comment on the font. ||||| Thanks to Hillary Clinton's new logo for her 2016 presidential bid, graphic design is at the forefront of the American political conversation. 
 
 The fate of the United States will clearly all come down to branding (and candidates' takes on the issues, I guess). That's why designer Rick Wolff came up with Hillvetica, inspired by the font used in Clinton's official logo unveiled in a video on Sunday. 
 
 If I could afford font software, I'd make & release #Hillvetica, free. Which crowdfunding should I use? pic.twitter.com/SRoigWDGr6 — Rick Wolff (@RickWolff) April 14, 2015 
 
 Hillvetica maintains the bold, patriotic red-and-blue color scheme; the arrows are meant to remind you that Hillary is going places. 
 
 Wolff is currently working to make Hillvetica a downloadable font, presumably for Hillary supporters to create PowerPoint presentations. There is no word on whether Comic Rands or Times New Rubio are in development. 
 
 
 
 
 
 BONUS: All the times Hillary Clinton hinted at a 2016 presidential bid ||||| On Monday, graphic designer Rick Wolff created a typeface he calls ""Hillary Bold"" or ""Hillvetica."" It uses the same (weird) look and feel of the logo from the Hillary Clinton campaign for president, which became (in)famous shortly after her campaign went public on Sunday. 
 
 In short order, people started applying the lettering to other phrases. The Post's own Chris Ingraham made this tribute to one of Clinton's competitors:

 The alert was issued after police said Jeremiah Grant, 33, of South Berwick, Maine, abducted his 18-month-old son from the boy's home in Somersworth Thursday afternoon. 
 
 Somersworth police said at about 1:30 a.m. Friday, a Farmington police officer spotted Grant driving on Fairbanks Road in Farmington, Maine. 
 
 The officer stopped Grant and was able to confirm the boy was still in the car. Police said Grant then fled the scene, leading authorities on a chase. 
 
 Grant was stopped after officers deployed road spikes on Route 27 in New Vineyard, Maine. 
 
 The boy was found unharmed and was checked by first responders at the scene. 
 
 The boy was reunited with his mother in Farmington a short time later. They are believed to be on their way back to Somersworth. 
 
 Grant is from Berwick, Maine, and is listed on Maine's sex offender registry in connection with a sexual assault that occurred outside the state. 
 
 Police said Grant was at the Somersworth home where the child and his mother lived on Thursday afternoon. Police said that when the mother was distracted, Grant took the child and fled in a vehicle that was in the yard. The mother called police right away, and the Amber Alert was issued after 9 p.m. 
 
 Grant is being held in Maine on a fugitive from justice charge. Police said he will be extradited back to New Hampshire to face charges including taking without owner's consent and a felony count of interference with custody.

 Police in Somersworth, New Hampshire, have cancelled an Amber Alert issued Thursday night for a missing 18-month-old boy and his 33-year-old father after the man's arrest and locating the unharmed infant. 
 
 Malachi Grant's mother thought she'd never see her young son again after he was abducted from their home by Jeremiah Grant. After what she calls 18 hours of pure agony, they were reunited Friday morning. 
 
 Stephanie Fall is convinced her baby's father had no intention of keeping him alive. 
 
 ""I am blessed to be holding my son alive right now and safe,"" Fall said Friday morning. 
 
 Police say Malachi went on a dangerous 120-mile journey from Somersworth to Farmington, Maine, in a stolen car driven by his father with no food, no water and no car seat. 
 
 ""There were issues with his mental well-being that really, really concerned us,"" explained Capt. David Kretschmar. 
 
 Authorities considered Malachi's father, Jeremiah Grant, to be dangerous and mentally unstable. 
 
 Fall says Malachi's father Jeremiah Grant was having a nervous breakdown. She says when he stole Malachi and took off in her car, she thought her little boy was never coming home. 
 
 ""When your child is missing in a dangerous situation, you are without words to describe the feeling,"" she said. 
 
 Grant is a registered sex offender, convicted of a sexual assault in Dover in 2011. 
 
 But Fall says that has nothing to do with this. 
 
 ""If someone would take the time to look at, it's a Class A misdemeanor,"" Fall explained. ""It's definitely not for raping anybody or touching children, and I'd like to straighten that fact out."" 
 
 The search set off an Amber Alert just after 9 p.m. Thursday. 
 
 Within four hours, authorities in Maine were tipped off to the vehicle's location. They arrested Grant and found Malachi in the backseat. 
 
 ""A lot of us are dads and moms, so it hits us in a different way when that happens,"" Capt. Kretschmar said. 
 
 Somersworth police say they weren't going home until the little boy was found. 
 
 For that, Fall says ""thank you"" will never be enough. 
 
 ""They stayed and they weren't stopping until they found my son and I appreciate it very much,"" Fall said. 
 
 She's also thanking the thousands of people who saw the Amber Alert and shared it on social media. She truly believes that's why Malachi is alive.

 Police believe Jeremiah Grant is driving a four door gray 1999 Honda Accord with New Hampshire plate 285-4569. Investigators have reason to believe that Grant is mentally unstable and is a danger to himself and others. 
 
 The child is 34 inches tall and about 38 pounds with brown hair and hazel eyes. Malachi was wearing a lime green t-shirt with black stripes, black shorts and navy blue sneakers. 
 
 Jeremiah Grant lives in Berwick, Maine, is described as six feet tall, 275 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes. He is a registered sex offender in Maine. 
 
 He has tattoos on his left neck saying “Alpha Male”, a skull on his upper left arm and the inscription “INSANE” on his left forearm with a cross above it. 
 
 Also on his left forearm is the inscription “GRANT”. On the right inner forearm he also has a tattoo of a skull.

130,"The hardest blow yet against Newt Gingrich comes this afternoon from Ron Paul's campaign, which dropped this lengthy, scathing video documenting Gingrich's ideological deviations and ties to the D.C. influence trade: 
 
 Featured in the video: Gingrich's comments about Paul Ryan, Rush Limbaugh's response, the former speaker's climate change video with Nancy Pelosi, extensive reports on Gingrich's ties to health care companies and Freddie Mac. 
 
 Oh, and remember that Iowa voter who told Gingrich last spring that he was an ""embarrassment to our party""? He's there, too. 
 
 We'll see who, if anyone, actually puts clips like this up on television, but at the very least Paul's well-produced video shows how much damning source material is available. ||||| Texas Congressman and fundraising powerhouse Ron Paul‘s campaign released an absolutely brutal web ad attacking current national frontrunner Newt Gingrich for “serial hypocrisy.” The spot, which is a too-long-for-TV 148 seconds, features a review of Gingrich flip-flops, accompanied by blistering criticism from the likes of Rush Limbaugh and GOP golden boy Rep. Paul Ryan. With Paul polling in third place in New Hampshire, should Newt be worried about the Ronulan attack? 
 
 The ad doesn’t even touch all the bases on Gingrich, but hits hard at Gingrich over his climate change ad with Nancy Pelosi, his criticism of the Ryan budget plan, his Freddie Mac connections, and his support for an individual health insurance mandate, all set to an epic score, and sinister, grainy black-and-white photography. The production is slick, if a bit cliched, but the overall effect is devastating. 
 
 Ordinarily, a web ad wouldn’t figure to have much of an impact, but Ron Paul’s supporters are a highly motivated, resourceful lot who will doubtless make sure this spot reaches maximum eyeballs. 
 
 Newt Gingrich is the latest in a long line of non-Romneys to take a ride at the top of the polls, and Ron Paul is one of the only candidates left who hasn’t gotten his turn. While Paul is routinely ignored by the media as a candidate with a cultish following who can’t improve on his middling poll numbers, much crazier things have happened in this year’s Republican race. Game on. 
 
 Here’s the ad, from the Ron Paul campaign: 
 
 
 
 ||||| Topics: 2012 Elections, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul 
 
 I was awestruck by a new Ron Paul ad attacking Newt Gingrich even before I saw that I have a cameo at the end. Full disclosure: I think the ad would be better without me. It’s most devastating when it features conservatives attacking Newt. 
 
 And it features plenty of them. Watch it yourself, below. It’s titled “Newt Gingrich: Serial Hypocrisy,” which seems an arch reference to Gingrich’s history of serial adultery. But the ad ignores the messy divorces and the Tiffany’s credit line to stick to politics, and there’s plenty to work with. 
 
 It starts with Gingrich blathering on about “policy and values and seriousness,” and it then marches through examples of his flip-flops and hypocrisy on each of those points. The ad he made with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, back when he admitted climate change was real, is damning, but news anchor voice-overs reporting his changing positions on the bank bailouts are pretty bad too. We get his attack on Paul Ryan’s budget, and Ryan’s angry reaction, as well as the GOP voter who told Gingrich he was “an embarrassment to the party.” We see Fox anchors and CNBC’s Larry Kudlow voicing disapproval for his shifting stands on Freddie Mac, before and after it was revealed he took almost $2 million for strategic advice (don’t call it lobbying!). 
 
 The ad gathers momentum, and a sense of moral outrage, as it focuses on Gingrich’s taking millions from Freddie Mac as well as the healthcare industry, and supporting policies — the individual mandate, universal private insurance, end of life care — that he now opposes, since they’re all anathema to the GOP base. That’s where MSNBC’s Ed Schultz and I come in; Schultz reads from the Washington Post story revealing Gingrich took $37 million from the healthcare industry, and I note his ever-changing positions on healthcare-related issues. “He’s flipped and flopped based on who’s paying him,” I tell Schultz. The central voice, though, is Rush Limbaugh, mocking Gingrich over and over. When Schultz and Limbaugh and I agree, you know someone’s in trouble. 
 
 I’ve been saying this week that it’s time for the former front-runner Mitt Romney to go on the offensive against Gingrich. But Romney had trouble holding his own in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. So he’s got his own problems now, when he’s tripped up by simple questions about his own flip-flops from relatively friendly Fox News. Ron Paul served up Gingrich’s goose instead. Paul showed similar flair with an ad taking down Texas Gov. Rick Perry, touting his ties to Al Gore. Whether on foreign policy or in the ad war, Paul keeps this race interesting. I’ll be talking about all of this with MSNBC’s Ed Schultz — again — at 8 ET. I’ll aspire to make someone else’s highlight reel. Here’s the ad:

 Texas Rep. and GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul released a harsh attack ad Wednesday evening against Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and a fellow GOP candidate. 
 
 The ad, available to journalists through a “private” YouTube link, hit Gingrich for numerous allegedly contradictory statements about individual health care mandates, his involvement with Fannie and Freddie Mac, and Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan. 
 
 The Web ad uses quotes from media outlets and commentators including ABC News, the Los Angeles Times, MSNBC’s Ed Schultz, Fox Business Network’s Gerri Willis and conservative radio talked Rush Limbaugh — and numerous statements from Gingrich himself. 
 
 The Paul campaign says it is working to prove that Gingrich is not a consistent conservative. 
 
 “Our campaign is making a bold move to debunk the myth that the Newt we are seeing on the 2012 campaign trail is the conservative he has been touted to be all along,” said Paul national campaign chairman Jesse Benton. 
 
 “This step we are taking is necessary, as voters are seeking authenticity among conservatives who are able to show a decades-long career of consistently walking the walk of Constitutional principles, limited government, and promoting sound money and economic policy,” Benton continued. “Ron Paul is the only Republican presidential candidate with that record.” 
 
 The Gingrich campaign defended Newt’s conservative record, but refrained from mentioning Paul — instead taking a shot at GOP candidate Mitt Romney. 
 
 “No candidate in the race has achieved more conservative reform of government or spent more time and energy championing the cause of the conservative movement than Newt Gingrich, which is why voters across the country are choosing Newt over Mitt Romney,” Gingrich campaign spokesman R.C. Hammond said when asked for comment.

131,"JUDY WOODRUFF: Herman Cain, the latest Republican presidential candidate to lead in the polls, spent the day rebutting sexual harassment charges, including, as you will hear shortly, here on the NewsHour. 
 
 Asked repeatedly about the claims, he dismissed them as baseless. 
 
 The story first reported last night on news website Politico.com alleged that when Cain was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, at least two female employees reported inappropriate behavior to senior members of the organization. 
 
 The Politico story said -- quote -- ""The women complained of sexually suggestive behavior by Cain that made them angry and uncomfortable, the sources said, and they signed agreements with the restaurant group that gave them financial payouts to leave the association."" 
 
 For its part, the National Restaurant Association says it doesn't comment on personnel matters. 
 
 Today, Cain denied the reports for the first time in an appearance on FOX News Channel. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN, (R) presidential candidate: I have never sexually harassed anyone -- anyone -- and, absolutely, I -- these are false accusations. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: And in an appearance at the National Press Club, he conceded he knew about the investigation. 
 
 RELATED INFORMATION Herman Cain: Sexual Harassment Allegations Are 'Baffling' 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: While at the Restaurant Association, I was accused of sexual harassment, and it was concluded after a thorough investigation that it had no basis. 
 
 As far as a settlement, I am unaware of any sort of settlement. I hope it wasn't for much, because I didn't do anything. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Asked if his rivals were helping to fuel the flames of this story, he said: 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: I told you this bull's-eye on my back has gotten bigger. 
 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: I have no idea. We have no idea the source of this witch-hunt, which is really what it is. We have no idea. We've been busy trying to get my message out. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Today's responses were in contrast to Cain's no-comment of yesterday. 
 
 The report comes at a critical time for Cain. He leads the Republican field nationally and is ahead in a key early state, with a new Des Moines Register poll showing him on top in Iowa. 
 
 And now to our Herman Cain interview. I talked to him just a short while ago. 
 
 It's the fifth in our series of vote 2012 conversations with the Republican presidential contenders. 
 
 Herman Cain, thank you for talking with us. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Thank you, Judy. Delighted to be here. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as we just saw in that piece, you were saying you did not sexually harass anyone. Let me just ask you, though, a couple of questions -- 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Sure. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: -- to help us understand this. Setting that question aside, what was your relationship with these two women who are making these allegations? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Well, both of them reported to someone who reported to me at the National Restaurant Association, and so they were employees of the Restaurant Association. One of them made a formal charge that I turned over to my general counsel to follow up on to get it resolved. He did -- came back after several months and said there's no basis to it. She couldn't find anyone to corroborate her story. So it was a false sexual harassment claim. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about the other woman? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: The other one I never even knew that that was a claim, formally or otherwise. Totally have no idea. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you know what incidents or -- either incident or incidents they're talking about? And were you ever alone with either one of these women? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: The answer is -- not in a social setting, but maybe in an office or something like that, and we'd have a big convention in Chicago. 
 
 One incident with the one who made the formal charge, the only one that I could recall after a day of trying to remember specifics, was once I referenced this lady's height and I was standing near her, and I did this saying, you're the same height of my wife, because my wife is five feet tall and she comes up to my chin. This lady's five feet tall and she came up to my chin. So obviously she thought that that was too close for comfort. It showed up in the actual allegation. But at the time when I did that, you know, it was in my office, the door was wide open, and my secretary was sitting right there, as we were standing there and I made the little gesture. Other than that, I can't even recall what some of the other things were. And as I mentioned, they were all found to be baseless. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: And there was some mention of a hotel room at a convention or at a meeting. Did any one of these women, were they ever asked to meet you, or.... 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: That I absolutely do not recall. You know, I have no recollection of that. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Was there any behavior on your part that you think might have been inappropriate? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: In my opinion, no. But as you would imagine, it's in the eye of the person who thinks that maybe I crossed the line. 
 
 I worked for the Department of the Navy, the Coca-Cola Company, Pillsbury, Burger King, Godfather's Pizza -- years and years and years of working in the business environment, working around men, women, all types of people -- never, never accused of any sort of sexual harassment. I have never sexually harassed anyone. And so this false allegation to now come up is kind of baffling. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: So were -- have there ever been any other charges leveled against you of this nature that you're aware of? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: No. No, no. None ever that I am aware of. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: And in terms of the settlement which was reached by the Restaurant Association, you as the CEO were not aware of that, or you were aware of that? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: I was not. I was aware that an agreement was reached. The word ""settlement"" versus the word ""agreement,"" you know, I'm not sure what they called it. I know that there was some sort of agreement, but because it ended up being minimal, they didn't have to bring it to me. My general counsel and the head of human resources had the authority to resolve this thing. So it wasn't one of those things where it got above a certain authority level and I had to sign it. If I did -- and I don't think I did -- I don't even remember signing it because it was minimal in terms of what the agreement was. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: And we were told five figures. But let's move on because -- 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: OK. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: -- there are plenty of issues to talk about. 
 
 And first the economy, a lot of attention to your 9-9-9 tax plan. But let me ask you about the budget, about government spending. You have said that in your first year as president you'd like to see the budget balanced. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Yes. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Rick Perry has said he's got a plan that would do it, what, in eight years. Paul Ryan would do it in 30 years. It would take a huge, a mammoth cut of $1.6 trillion to get that budget in balance the first year. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Right. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: So my question is, what would you cut out of the biggest programs -- Medicare, Social Security, defense? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Well, we got to make sure we're talking apples and apples here. What I'm referring to is in my first year - in the first full fiscal year of my presidency, because remember, when you are sworn in, you inherit a fiscal year. The first full fiscal year, my objective is to have a fiscal year balanced budget. Here's how. 
 
 First, grow this economy robustly. It is projected that, for this year, 2011, that our GDP annualized will probably grow right around 1.6 percent. My 9-9-9 plan, based upon a static analysis and a dynamic analysis, say that this economy will be growing at around 5 percent. So we going to have more revenue coming in because we going to have more people working and more people paying taxes. So you've got to get both of them going at the same time. 
 
 Then -- 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: But you still would have to cut. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Let me get to the cuts. Yes, I was -- I plan to do an across-the-board 10 percent cut of all of the federal agencies. I just feel intuitively that it's there. 
 
 And then, ask my Cabinet -- 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Including Social Security and Medicare? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: No, no, no, no, no, no. No, not including Social Security and Medicare. That's a separate problem that we've got to come back and restructure. I have ideas on that. But I'm talking about the basic expenditures that runs these agencies, not the program. That's a separate problem that I want -- I plan to attack. And I'm saying the agency head is going to have to do a deep dive to help find additional monies in order to be able to do that. So that's the approach that we're going to use. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: So across the board. And you think you could come up with enough money without going after the entitlements. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Exactly. And the reason is growing the economy so the projection of revenues is going to be much higher. It's going to be tough, but I'm saying that that's the objective that we've set out there. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Two international questions. First, the Middle East -- Syria, where President Bashar Assad has been authorizing the murder of -- 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Yes. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: -- dissenters in that country. As president, would you be willing -- would you be prepared to send American forces -- either air power or ground troops, if necessary -- to put a stop to that? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: No. And here's why, Judy. It is sad that this brutal dictator is killing his own people in order to stay in power. They have never been our friends to begin with. 
 
 My philosophy on foreign policy starts with an extension of the Reagan philosophy: peace through strength. And I've added peace through strength and clarity. It's clear they're not our friends. 
 
 Now, if there is a way for us to help the opposition without putting our men and women in uniform in harm's way, I would be open to that and I would certainly consider that. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: An example of how you could do that? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Providing them -- 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: -- weapons? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Possibly. Possibly weapons, possibly food and supplies or water, if it were possible. But I would not put our men and women in harm's way simply because it is a humanitarian disaster. I don't believe in doing that. We cannot be the policemen for the world. 
 
 And so if it's clear who our friends are, clear who our enemies are, I want to first make sure that we stop giving money to our enemies. They've always been one of our enemies. And so as bad as it is from a humanitarian standpoint, we're not going to, you know, jump in there and jump in the middle there. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: China. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Yes. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you view China as a potential military threat to the United States? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: I do view China as a potential military threat to the United States. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: And what could you do as president to head that off? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: My China strategy is quite simply outgrow China. It gets back to economics. China has a $6 trillion economy and they're growing at approximately 10 percent. We have a $14 trillion economy -- much bigger -- but we're growing at an anemic 1.5, 1.6 percent. When we get our economy growing back at the rate of 5 or 6 percent that it has the ability to do, we will outgrow China. 
 
 And secondly, we already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority, going back to my statement: peace through strength and clarity. So yes they're a military threat. They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Your campaign. You have shot to the top of the polls nationally. You are running ahead in the key early states -- 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Yeah. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. You're doing very, very well. But there was a focus group of voters this past week in the state of Ohio. All of them like you; they say what you're saying is very appealing. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Right. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: But when they were asked directly, could they see you as president, not a single one of them said that they could. How do you persuade them that's not right, that you could be president? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: The way that I persuade them is to continue to do what I'm doing, which is taking my message to the people. 
 
 One of the reasons that I can only speculate that they had that impression is because I am the unconventional candidate. I'm running an unconventional campaign, and we're winning. We're moving up in the polls. So some people are still having to get to -- get used to the fact that a businessman who solved problems can, in fact, be president of the United States of America. More and more people are getting used to that idea. A lot of the states where I have spent a lot of time, they're getting used to that idea. So I believe that people will eventually get past that fact, because I've been continuing to promote the fact that I am unconventional. I'm the businessman, not the politician. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Any doubt in your mind you'll win the nomination -- the Republican nomination? 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: Today, no. It's not arrogance, Judy; it's called confidence. I had someone ask me one time, are you arrogant enough to be president? No, confidence. Everything that I've done in my career, I had to go into it with a lot of confidence in order to succeed, and more importantly surrounding myself with good people. That's always been one of my mantras: surround myself with good people, lay out some guiding principles, and then solve the problems that need to be solved. 
 
 JUDY WOODRUFF: Herman Cain, we thank you very much for talking with us. 
 
 HERMAN CAIN: It's a pleasure, Judy. Thank you. ||||| Cain fumbles Uzbekistan’s name: ‘Ubeki-beki-beki-stan-stan’

 Monday, October 10, 2011 10:34 EDT 
 
 Republican presidential hopeful and former Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain made clear his opinion of certain foreign affairs in an interview with a religious broadcaster. 
 
 Cain sat down for an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network, where interviewer David Brody asked him whether he was ready for the mainstream media’s “gotcha questions.” His example of such a question was, “Who is the president of Uzbekistan?” 
 
 Cain responded not only by revealing that he can’t name Uzbekistan’s president (Islam Karimov, for the curious), but by bobbling the country’s name, seemingly in jest. 
 
 “I’m ready for the ‘gotcha’ questions and they’re already starting to come,” Cain said. “And when they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I’m going to say, you know, I don’t know. Do you know?” 
 
 Uzbekistan is not as irrelevant as Cain appeared to think. President Barack Obama just weeks ago spoke with Karimov about using the country’s territory as a supply route to move inventory to troops in Afghanistan, moving from the current route through Pakistan. 
 
 Watch the video of Cain’s interview with CBN below, captured by ThinkProgress and embedded via YouTube. 
 
 (h/t: ThinkProgress)","– Herman Cain might just be a wee bit misinformed about China. In a quick exchange from his PBS News Hour interview last night, spotted by Raw Story, Cain was asked if China was a military threat. “Yes, they’re a military threat,” he replied. ""They’ve indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability … So yes, we have to consider them a military threat."" There’s just one little inaccuracy there: China has had nuclear weapons since 1964. Cain has never claimed to be a foreign policy guru—he once boasted that he didn’t know who the president of ""Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan"" was, a remark that greatly amused Hillary Clinton. In last night’s interview, he also said he wouldn’t send troops into Syria, saying the situation was “sad” but that the US couldn’t get involved. “I want to first make sure that we stop giving money to our enemies,” he said. The US does not send aid to Syria, but Cain may have been making a more general point.",<pad> Republican presidential candidate in the polls.</s>,0.015503874805600714,0.0,0.015503874805600714

 The Bahraini Court of Appeals confirmed the conviction of Zainab al-Khawaja on charges of insulting the king and reduced her sentence from three years in prison to one, London-based Amnesty reported. 
 
 It also imposed a fine of 3,000 Bahraini dinars ($7,953.34). Failure to pay would result in the extension of her prison term by a year and a half. Bahraini judicial officials were not immediately available for comment. 
 
 Al-Khawaja, 32, is the daughter of prominent Bahraini activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who is currently serving a life sentence for his role in pro-democracy protests in 2011. 
 
 She has been arrested and released several times since the 2011 protests, and has already served over a year in prison. 
 
 She is currently appealing against three other convictions, including a four-month sentence over another photo-ripping protest in 2012 and a nine-month sentence for ""insulting a public official"" by trying to visit her father in jail. 
 
 The week of her sentencing, other human rights activists launched a Twitter campaign to draw attention to the case, with the hashtag #HappyBirthdayZainab. The court's decision came down on her thirty-second birthday. 
 
 Her family told Amnesty that she intended to keep her infant son with her in prison if forced to serve her sentence.

 “The Bahraini Court of Appeals’ decision to reject Zainab Al-Khawaja’s appeal for freedom and to incarcerate her for one year is a vindictive assault on freedom of expression and offers yet another example of the Bahraini authorities’ use of oppressive tactics to silence peaceful activists,” said James Lynch, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Amnesty International. 
 
 “It is ludicrous that Zainab Al-Khawaja is facing a year in prison simply for tearing up a photo of the head of state. The Bahraini authorities must ensure her conviction and prison sentence are quashed. She should not be punished in any way for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression.” 
 
 Laws that prohibit insults or the disrespect of heads of state or other public officials are contrary to international human rights law and standards. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the Bahraini authorities to repeal articles in its Penal Code that criminalize freedom of expression. 
 
 Zainab Al-Khawaja is the daughter of prominent activist and prisoner of conscience Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, who is currently serving a life sentence for his peaceful role in anti-government protests in 2011. 
 
 In addition to facing a year in prison, she was fined 3,000 BD (nearly $8,000), a sum she may not to be able to afford. If the fine is not paid her prison term will be extended by around a year and a half. 
 
 Zainab Al-Khawaja has been arrested and released several times since December 2011 and has previously spent almost a year and a half in prison. 
 
 She is also appealing three other convictions against her, including a four-month sentence for two charges of “destroying public property” for ripping up photos of the King of Bahrain in May 2012 and a one-year sentence for “insulting a public officer” after she spoke out to defend another prisoner who was insulted and humiliated by a prison guard in June 2013. The verdicts on the appeal of those convictions will be issued on 3 December. 
 
 On 17 November, she will appeal a nine-month sentence related to ""entering a restricted area"" and ""insulting a public official"", when she sought to visit her father who was on hunger strike in Jaw prison in August 2014. 
 
 Zainab Al-Khawaja is one of several human rights or political activists in Bahrain recently imprisoned for peacefully expressing their opinion. 
 
 “The Bahraini authorities’ persistent persecution of human rights activists and other government critics is a glaring example of their abject failure to deliver on promised reforms. To prove they are serious about upholding human rights, they need to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners detained in Bahrain solely for peacefully expressing their views,” said James Lynch.","– The daughter of a well-known Bahraini human rights activist was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail for delivering the ultimate insult to her country's king: ripping up a picture of him, Reuters reports. Zainab al-Khawaja, 32, lost her appeal on a conviction for tearing up a photo of King Hamad during an October 2014 court appearance, Amnesty International USA notes.

 Egypt's state broadcaster has suspended eight of its female TV presenters and told them to go on a diet, sparking uproar among women's rights groups. 
 
 The Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) has given the women one month to slim down before they can appear on air again with an ""appropriate appearance"", the Al-Yawm al-Sabi website reports. The ERTU has a female director, Safaa Hegazy, a former state TV anchor herself. 
 
 The announcement prompted an outcry among the affected presenters. Khadija Khattab, a host on Egypt's Channel 2, told the paper that she wants people to watch her most recent TV appearances and judge for themselves if she is really ""fat"", and whether she deserves to be prevented from working. Another presenter said the situation had upset their families and should have been dealt with internally. 
 
 The Women's Centre for Guidance and Legal Awareness condemned the move, saying it ""violates the constitution"" and is a form of violence against women. It's called on the ERTU to backtrack. Despite the criticism, ERTU sources told the Veto news website that the decision won't be reversed, but that the women won't have their pay and benefits docked. 
 
 Egyptian media commentators are debating whether the suspensions were justified. At the state-owned Al-Ahram daily, journalist Fatma al-Sharawi says she thinks the policy should be applied across local TV stations. But author and academic Waheed Abdul Majid thinks the channel should focus on improving its content rather than the appearance of the presenters. 
 
 On social media, some users voiced support for the women, but others called them ""bakabouzas"", a term Egyptians use to describe overweight girls. One female Twitter user described ERTU head Safaa Hegazy as a ""strong woman"" for making the decision. 
 
 The presenters have been defended in parliament, though, with male MP and journalist Sayyid Hegazy asking: ""Who is an ideal weight in Egypt?"" He told the Sada al-Balad news site that a presenter ""might be a little overweight, but she is eloquent"".

 Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter. ||||| Egypt's state-run television has suspended eight of its female presenters for being overweight - telling them they can return to the air only after they go a diet. 
 
 The move sparked outrage among women's groups and members of parliament but state television authorities show no sign of backing down. 
 
 The presenters were given given one month to lose weight and told they will not be allowed back onto television until they have an ""appropriate appearance"", according to the Youm7 newspaper. 
 
 The decision was made by Safaa Hegazi, the female chief of Egypt's ERTU public broadcaster. 
 
 She took over the position in April on a promise to modernise Egyptian state and make it once again competitive with other major broadcasters in the Arab world. 
 
 Mrs Hegazi's order to suspend the eight women seems to have been part of this drive to overhaul her organisation's look. ||||| CAIRO — Most Egyptian journalists have had to watch their tongues and tone down their reporting over the past three years to keep their jobs under a military-dominated government. Now, the state is ordering some women working as television anchors to practice a similar restraint with their weight. 
 
 Earlier this week, Safaa Hegazy, the director of state-run Egyptian radio and television, barred eight anchorwomen from appearing on the air for a month, saying they were overweight, the state-owned Al-Ahram news website confirmed. Ms. Hegazy ordered the women to go on a diet during their suspensions, Al-Ahram said. 
 
 Khadija Khatab, one of the eight anchorwomen, said that she had not yet been formally notified of Ms. Hegazy’s order, but added that she was recently told that “measures will be taken against” those who fail to lose weight by mid-September, according to an interview she gave to a privately owned television station. 
 
 Ms. Khatab said she was offended that coverage of her ordeal included words like “fat” and similar terms she called “unfair” and “insulting.” She also said that the pictures of her that had been circulating and mocked on the internet and social media sites were old and that she had lost weight since they were taken.

 “I believe I am an ordinary Egyptian woman who looks normal, and I don’t wear too much makeup,” Ms. Khatab said, challenging people to contradict her.","– Eight female TV hosts in Egypt have been suspended, and they've been given one month to win their jobs back—if they come back a few pounds lighter. Via the BBC, the Al-Yawm al-Sabi website reports the state-run Egyptian Radio and Television Union issued the slim-down mandate, though the women are being paid and receiving benefits during their monthlong moratorium. Women's rights activists, as well as the presenters themselves, are livid: An Egyptian women's rights NGO is calling the edict a form of violence against women, and host Khadija Khattab is imploring viewers to watch her newscasts to determine a) if she's ""fat,"" and b) whether her weight should affect her job status. ""I believe I am an ordinary Egyptian woman who looks normal,"" she says, per the New York Times. Critics are also calling the move sexist, as only female presenters were suspended, the Independent notes. The ERTU is headed by Safaa Hegazy, a former female news anchor herself who the Telegraph notes was brought in in April to make the broadcaster more competitive, since ratings for state-run channels tanked after the 2011 Egyptian uprising. Some who approve of the suspension are women: Per the Times, a female commentator for the government-run Al-Ahram website says she's ""sickened"" by the suspended hosts' ""disgusting and repulsive"" appearance, while a female colleague asks: ""Is a ban for eight enough?"" The chair of Cairo's Association for the Development and Enhancement of Women, however, tells the Independent that ""judging anybody on the basis of his or her body weight is not the right criterion,"" adding weight shouldn't be an issue ""as long as he or she does not use nasty words on the air and knows well how to deal with guests.""

134,"Samsung has confirmed that it is recalling the Galaxy Note 7, its newest smartphone, following reports that some devices exploded. 
 
 The device was launched less than a month ago to very positive reviews, but concerns about the battery in some units — which reportedly combusted while charging — have forced the company’s hand. Yesterday, Samsung confirmed it was investigating the issue, and now it has taken quick action to avoid potential tragedies. 
 
 Samsung said it has sold 2.5 million devices so far, and it plans to replace them all in “the coming weeks.” It added that it is aware of 35 cases of faulty batteries, although it isn’t clear how many of that number had exploded.

 The Note 7 looked like being a continuation of positive progress for Samsung this year. Its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge phones were released to glowing reviews earlier this year and impressive sales helped Samsung to its most profitable quarter for two years.

135,"Buccaneers aboard the flagship of notorious 18th-century pirate Blackbeard apparently enjoyed a rollicking read, according to an unlikely discovery in a cannon chamber. 
 
 A handful of paper scraps recovered from the wreck of Queen Anne's Revenge have been identified as fragments of the 1712 book A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform’d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, by Captain Edward Cooke. 
 
 The discovery was announced Thursday during a presentation by conservators from the Queen Anne’s Revenge (QAR) Conservation Lab at the annual meeting of the Society of Historical Archaeology held in New Orleans. 
 
 Queen Anne's Revenge went aground outside of what is now Beaufort, North Carolina, in 1718, and Blackbeard was killed while battling British naval forces in the Pamlico Sound a few months later. The wreck of the pirate's flagship was found by private salvagers in 1996 and excavation by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources began a year later. 
 
 The fragments were embedded in a wet mass of textile scraps removed from a breech-loading cannon chamber during its cleaning and conservation in 2016, according to QAR Lab conservator Erik Farrell. The wad, blackened with gunpowder residue, may have served as a gasket for the wooden tampion, a plug that protected the cannon muzzle from the elements. 
 
 Sixteen paper fragments, none larger than a U.S. quarter, were eventually identified, and seven of the fragments had legible text. As conservators gently pried the fragments of paper apart, they noticed that the text on successive layers was running in the same direction, leading them to suspect that they had the remains of several pages from the same book. 
 
 Eventually, they could make out words including ""south"" and fathom,"" which suggested the fragments may have come from some sort of maritime or navigational text. But there was a particular word that led to the book's ultimate identification, says QAR Lab conservator Kimberly Kenyon. 
 
 View Images A paper fragment, cleaned and dried after removal from the cannon chamber, reveals text. Photograph courtesy N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources 
 
 ""There was one really key word that stood out: 'Hilo.' It was very distinctive and italicized, which might indicate a place name,"" Kenyon tells National Geographic. 
 
 ""It really was luck."" 
 
 Armed with the distinctive clue, QAR Lab conservators reached out to Johanna Green, a specialist in the history of printed text at the University of Glasgow. While the researchers ruled out accounts of Hilo, Hawaii, which didn't appear in European literature until after James Cook's expedition of 1778, Green pointed out earlier English-language mentions of the Spanish settlement of Ilo on the Peruvian coast. 
 
 The earliest accounts came from English sailors involved in attacking Ilo during Pacific voyages. Stories about the plunder of Spanish holdings were popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, says Kenyon. ""The English audiences were eating this up."" 
 
 When these printed accounts didn't match with the book fragments from Queen Anne's Revenge, the researchers looked to other stories of Pacific voyages that referenced the plunder of Ilo and eventually determined that their bits of paper came from pages 177, 178, and 183-188 of the 1712 first edition of Captain Edward Cooke's A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform’d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711. 
 
 Cooke's book describes his experiences on an expedition made by two ships, Duke and Dutchess, led by Captain Woodes Rogers. Rogers also published an account of the voyage, and both books describe the rescue of Alexander Selkirk from an island on which he had been marooned for four years. That rescue became the inspiration for Daniel Defoe’s 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. 
 
 Shipwreck From Explorer Vasco da Gama's Fleet Discovered After 18 years of research, excavations and archaeological analysis, National Geographic grantee David Mearns has successfully discovered one of Vasco da Gama's ships lost at sea in 1503 off the coast of present-day Oman. 
 
 Historical accounts show that at least some members of a pirate crew were often literate. Officers would have needed to read navigational charts, Kenyon observes. She also points to accounts of buccaneers pilfering books from seized ships, and even a mention of Blackbeard's diary, which was stolen after his death. 
 
 The team of QAR Lab conservators is working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Division of Archives and Records, along with the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, to conserve the very fragile paper fragments, and a display about the find is being planned as part of the department’s Blackbeard 300th anniversary events during 2018. 
 
 The remains of A Voyage to the South Sea take their place among other notable artifacts from the wreck of Queen Anne's Revenge, including the ship's bell, an ornamental sword, and even the remains of a delicate pocket watch. With some 100,000 of the 400,000 artifacts raised from the wreck so far still awaiting conservation, Kenyon is confident that more remarkable discoveries from Blackbeard's ship are yet to come from the QAR Lab. ||||| Old-timey pirates are typically portrayed as stupid, unrefined thugs whose only interests involved plundering captured ships and forcing enemies to walk the plank. The recent discovery of legible text on paper pulled from the cannon of Blackbeard’s flagship paints a strikingly different picture of these misunderstood sailors. 
 
 Work by conservationists from North Carolina’s Department of Natural and Cultural Resources shows that Blackbeard and his crew got a kick out of reading “voyage narratives”—a popular form of literature in the late 17th and early 18th century that chronicled the true accounts of maritime expeditions. Specifically, Blackbeard kept a copy of Edward Cooke’s A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform’d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, detailing the British naval officer’s participation in a global expedition aboard the ships Duke and Dutchess.

 The conservators made the discovery while working on artifacts pulled from the wreckage of Blackbeard’s flagship, the Queen Anne’s Revenge, which ran aground near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina in 1718. Blackbeard stole the ship from the French in 1717, when it was being used as a slave ship (the French had stolen the merchant ship from its original British owners in 1711, when it was called the Concord). The dreaded pirate gave the vessel a new name, added 40 guns, and made it his flagship. The wreck was re-discovered in 1996, and most of the ship’s 27 known cannons have been raised. 
 
 The researchers found 16 tiny fragments of paper in a mass of wet sludge crammed inside the chamber of a breech-loading cannon (how it got there is anyone’s guess). The largest piece was only the size of a quarter, but it’s exceptionally rare to find paper in a submerged wreck—particularly one that’s 300 years old. Paper tends to deteriorate rapidly under water.

 Working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the department’s Division of Archives and Records, along with the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, the Queen Anne’s Revenge Conservation Lab researchers worked to preserve and study the fragments. As work progressed, it became clear that some of the fragments still contained traces of legible printed text. After months of research, the bits of paper were sourced back to the first edition of Cooke’s book, published in 1712. 
 
 As noted, voyage narratives were a popular genre at the time, often inspiring both real and fictional voyages. Cooke’s book describes the rescue of Alexander Selkirk, who had been marooned on an island for four years—an account that inspired Daniel Defoe’s 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. 
 
 The discovery provides evidence of the kinds of books carried on ships in the early 18th century—pirate ships included. It also tells us a bit more about Blackbeard and his crew; it’s considered the first archaeological evidence of the presence of a specific book aboard the Queen Anne’s Revenge. Of course, we don’t know if Blackbeard, whose real name was Edward Teach, actually read the book.

 That Blackbeard had books like this on his ship shouldn’t come as a surprise. He may have read the book as entertainment, helping to pass away the long hours at sea. But he may have also read Cooke’s accounts to get fresh ideas about new places to plunder. 
 
 Blackbeard had a fearsome reputation, no doubt, but there was another side to him as well. Historian David M. Ullian of Amherst College explains: 
 
 Blackbeard often fought, or simply showed himself, wearing a big feathered tricorn, and having multiple swords, knives, and pistols at his disposal. It was reported in the General History of the Pirates that he had hemp and lighted matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle. Accounts of people who saw him fighting say that they thought he ‘looked like the devil’ with his fearsome face and the smoke cloud around his head. This image, which he cultivated, has made him the premier image of the seafaring pirate.

 But the image Blackbeard portrayed to his victims was in defiance of the man himself, who was described as shrewd, calculating, and surprisingly merciful. As Ullian writes, “Ironically, despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone. He generally prevailed by fear alone.” 
 
 [NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources] ||||| Were 18th-century pirates literate? What sort of books did they keep on board ship? A fascinating new discovery at the Queen Anne’s Revenge Conservation Lab in Greenville helps answer those questions. 
 
 Archaeological conservators with the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources’ QAR Lab have discovered and conserved a type of artifact that very rarely survives on shipwreck sites – paper. 
 
 During conservation work on artifacts recovered from the wreckage of Queen Anne’s Revenge, flagship of the pirate Blackbeard, 16 tiny fragments of paper were discovered in a mass of wet sludge removed from the chamber for a breech-loading cannon. The largest fragment was only about the size of a quarter. Paper is an extremely rare material to find on shipwrecks, especially one 300 years old, because it usually disintegrates very quickly under water. 
 
 QAR Lab conservators are working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the department’s Division of Archives and Records, along with the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, to conserve the very fragile paper fragments. As the work progressed another discovery was made – that there was still legible printed text on some of the fragments, although only a few words were visible. The challenge then became not just to conserve the paper fragments, but also to identify where they were from. 
 
 After many months of research, the fragments were determined to be from a 1712 first edition of a book by Captain Edward Cooke, “A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform’d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711.” 
 
 Cooke’s book was a “voyage narrative” describing his adventures on an expedition made by two ships, Duke andDutchess, which sailed from Bristol, England in 1708. The expedition leader was Captain Woodes Rogers, who also published an account of the expedition, and who was later sent in 1718 as Royal Governor to rid the Bahamas of pirates. 
 
 Voyage narratives were popular literature in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, inspiring new voyages both real and fictional. Both Cooke’s and Rogers’ works describe the rescue of Alexander Selkirk from an island on which he had been marooned for four years. Selkirk’s story became the inspiration for Daniel Defoe’s 1719 novel, “Robinson Crusoe.” Although books like these voyage narratives would have been relatively common on ships of the early 18th century, archaeological evidence for them is exceedingly rare, and this find represents a glimpse into the reading habits of a pirate crew. 
 
 This unique find from the wreckage of Queen Anne’s Revenge provides archaeological evidence for books carried on ships in the early 18th century, and adds to our knowledge of the history of Blackbeard’s flagship and those who sailed her. The historical record has several references to books aboard vessels in Blackbeard’s fleet, but provides no specific titles; this find is the first archaeological evidence for their presence on QAR. 
 
 The task of conserving, recording and documenting the fragments is continuing, and a display about the find is being planned as part of the department’s Blackbeard 300th anniversary events during 2018.","– Pirates of yore plundered, but they also read books, apparently. While cleaning sludge out of a cannon recovered from Blackbeard's flagship, scientists discovered bits of paper and were able to figure out the name of a book kept on board. The 16 fragments, each no bigger than a quarter, were lumped together inside the chamber of one of 27 known cannons aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, which ran aground off North Carolina in 1718 and was discovered by divers in 1996, per a release. A few printed words on seven of the fragments helped with the sleuthing, reports National Geographic. After months studying the pieces—one of which reads ""three or"" and ""Hilo, to""—researchers at North Carolina's Queen Anne's Revenge Conservation Lab identified the book from which the paper came. Deciding Hilo likely referred to the Spanish settlement of Ilo in Peru, researchers scoured early accounts of voyages mentioning the place until they came across the right one. It was a first edition of Edward Cooke's A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, which describes a British naval officer's seafaring adventures from 1708 to 1711. Published in 1712, the book would act as inspiration for Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. According to Gizmodo, such ""voyage narratives"" also inspired real-life expeditions and might've given Blackbeard ""fresh ideas about new places to plunder."" Whatever its purpose, the book was apparently considered dispensable when pages 177, 178, and 183-188 were applied to the cannon, possibly as a seal for its wooden plug.

136,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Shortly after dusk along a lonely stretch of Interstate 95, armed robbers hijacked an armored truck, tied up the two guards and disappeared into the night with 275 pounds of gold bars. 
 
 The guards working for Transvalue Inc. of Miami reported pulling off to the side of the interstate about 6:30 p.m. Sunday after their vehicle began having mechanical problems in eastern North Carolina, according to the Wilson County Sheriff's Office. 
 
 The guards told police they were surprised by three armed men driving a white van who ordered the guards to lie on the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and then marched them into nearby woods. 
 
 The robbers then helped themselves to barrels filled with about $4.8 million in gold before making their getaway. Transvalue said its employees were not injured during the heist. 
 
 Transvalue chief executive officer Jay Rodriguez said the truck carrying the gold bars left Miami about 4 a.m. Sunday. The load was headed to Attleboro, Massachusetts, a town south of Boston nicknamed ""Jewelry City"" for the large number of manufacturers based there. 
 
 ""At this time we are working with the authorities to try and resolve this matter,"" Rodrigez said. ""We are offering a $50,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of these criminals."" 
 
 Though Interstate 95 is one of the busiest roads on the East Coast, the rural stretch where the robbery occurred is relatively isolated, bordered by trees and farms. 
 
 Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. declined interview requests Monday and did not respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking additional information, such as what weapons the robbers used or how they managed to get the armored truck open. No detailed description of the suspects or their vehicle was released. 
 
 Shelley Lynch, spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Charlotte field office, said agents are assisting the local sheriff and are working to determine whether a federal crime has been committed. 
 
 According to its website, Transvalue specializes in transporting cash, precious metals, gems and jewelry in armored trucks. The company says its shipments are insured for up to $100 million.

 — The FBI and Wilson County authorities are investigating the theft of an estimated $4 million worth of gold reportedly stolen during an armed robbery along Interstate 95 near Wilson Sunday evening, the sheriff's office says. 
 
 Two armed security guards told authorities that they were traveling from Miami to Massachusetts with a shipment of silver and gold when they pulled over at mile marker 114 after mechanical problems with their truck. 
 
 The sheriff's office says the guards reported that three armed men in a white van approached them, ordered them to the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and forced them to walk into some nearby woods. 
 
 Investigators, who responded to the scene shortly before 7 p.m., said the men then reportedly took three barrels of gold and left while the guards were in the woods. 
 
 It was unclear what form the gold was in, and the sheriff's office declined a request for an interview Monday morning. 
 
 But at gold's current value of about $40,000 per 1-kilogram bar, that could mean as many as 100 bars, or about 220 pounds. 
 
 A spokeswoman for the FBI said agents are looking to figure out if a federal crime occurred. 
 
 The guards are employed by TransValue Inc., which according to its website, is a Miami-based company that transports valuables between financial institutions. 
 
 Owner Jesus Rodriguez said he was unable to comment about the matter but confirmed the guards were driving a tractor-trailer. Neither was injured, he said. 
 
 The company is cooperating with authorities and is offering a $50,000 reward for any information that leads to an arrest.

137,"China’s plan to build a “Mars village” on a remote plateau in the country’s far northwest will cost about 400 million yuan (US$61.1 million), according to a blueprint for the project drawn up over the weekend. 
 
 The estimate was set after scientists and government officials from Delingha in Qinghai province, which will host the base, met to discuss the development of the scheme, Xinhua reported on Wednesday. 
 
 Liu Xiaoqun, director of lunar and deep space exploration at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was quoted as saying that the project would combine tourism and scientific exploration, though the report did not say when it might open. 
 
 China to build first Mars simulation base 
 
 The proposed base covers 95,000 square kilometres in the Qaidam Basin, an arid desert region on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, whose barren, rocky landscape most closely resembles the geographical conditions found on Mars, government officials said earlier. 
 
 It will comprise a large Mars-themed tourist attraction open to the general public and a simulated space exploration camp, complete with living accommodation, for those who want to taste what it might be like to live on the Red Planet. 
 
 “People dream about migrating to Mars, so what we want to do is give people a high-end experience of what it would actually be like to live in outer space,” Liu was quoted as saying. 
 
 He said he hoped the base would become a hub for scientific research and education. 
 
 The ambitious project has been in the works since November, when the government of Haixi prefecture in Qinghai signed a deal allowing the Chinese Academy of Sciences to use its land. 
 
 Zhang Biao, the deputy mayor of Delingha, said he hoped the project would provide a much-needed boost to the local economy. 
 
 China plans to grow potatoes in space ... like Matt Damon did in The Martian 
 
 “The construction of the simulated Mars base has important scientific and ecological significance,” he said. “It not only allows people to learn more about Mars and space exploration, but will also benefit economic development in the area.” 
 
 Despite being rich in natural resources, Qinghai remains largely undeveloped in comparison to China’s coastal areas, and has the second-lowest GDP of all Chinese provinces. 
 
 Planners are also hoping to capitalise on the area’s proximity to the Hexi Corridor in neighbouring Gansu province, which contains several tourist attractions linked to the ancient Silk Road that ran from the Tibetan Plateau to Central Asia. 
 
 Last year, the Chinese government revealed plans to launch an unmanned Mars mission in 2020. Artists’ impressions of the orbiter, lander and rover designed to probe the planet’s surface were released to the public last summer.

 The 55m-kilometre jaunt from planet Earth to the red planet takes up to a year. From Beijing’s international airport you’ll soon be able to fly there in just over seven hours. 
 
 
 
 In the latest leg of its multi-billion dollar race for space, China has unveiled plans to build a 400m yuan (£47m) replica of Mars on a spectacular, sandswept corner of the Tibetan plateau. 
 
 
 
 The “simulated Mars station” – a 95,000 square-kilometre tribute to the solar system’s second-smallest planet – will be built in Qinghai province’s Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan autonomous prefecture, not far from the westernmost tip of the Great Wall. 
 
 Xinhua, China’s official news agency, described the breathtaking red rock location as “the most Martian place on Earth”. 
 
 
 
 Liu Xiaoqun, a space exploration expert from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is leading the attempt to recreate Mars on Earth, declined to speak to the Guardian about the project. “Liu Xiaoqun isn’t in Beijing and he doesn’t want to take any interviews,” said Huang Jingyi, a press officer from the state-run academy. 
 
 
 
 But local reports suggest the remote desert base will be used for a mix of serious space research and money-spinning glamping of the sort that is becoming increasingly popular among well-off Chinese. 
 
 
 
 One section of the “hyper-arid” high-altitude camp will be used to train Chinese astronauts, state broadcaster CCTV reported earlier this summer. Another part will receive tourists hungering for a taste of life on Mars. “People dream about migrating to Mars, so what we want to do is give people a high-end experience of what it would actually be like to live in outer space,” Liu said, according to the South China Morning Post.

 Xinhua said adventure-seeking glampers would be housed on a “Mars campside” featuring “module-like accommodations” designed to simulate extraterrestrial living. A Mars-themed amusement park will also be created. CCTV said guests would “find out what life on Mars is really like” by experiencing weightlessness and hiking in the area’s arid desert terrain. Despite its isolated location, the campsite is likely to be rather more hospitable than Mars, which has an unbreathable atmosphere that contains only 0.2% oxygen. 
 
 
 
 Zhang Biao, the deputy mayor of Delingha, the nearest city to China’s Mars, said the project would boost the local economy as well as awareness of Beijing’s space program. “The building of the Mars village has both scientific and ecological significance,” he told Xinhua. 
 
 China is fighting to transform itself into a space superpower, as part of a wider bid for international prestige that has accelerated since Xi Jinping took power in 2012. Beijing hopes to have a permanent manned space station operating by 2022 and to send a probe to the real Mars in 2019. In 2013 China became the first country to soft land on the moon in almost four decades as part of efforts to send the first Chinese astronaut there. 
 
 
 
 Not everyone is convinced that Qinghai’s Mars simulation base will help China’s space ambitions. Jiao Weixin, a Peking University scholar, suggested it was more gimmick than game-changer. “It will be difficult for the Mars simulation to imitate the original,” he was quoted as saying by the Global Times newspaper.

 Hit in some areas by 24-foot waves, Cuba faced high winds, strong storm surge and torrential downpours as the storm marched across the country. 
 
 According to AP, the storm destroyed dozens of homes in Cuba's easternmost city, Baracoa, and left hundreds of others damaged. 
 
 Tweets coming out of Baracoa seem to indicate extensive damage in the area from extreme wind and storm surge. 
 
 Apart from Baracoa, there were no other reports of extensive damage, the AP reports. However, a large shipping container was washed three blocks inland from storm surge. 
 
 At least 11 deaths have been attributed to the storm. Five deaths were reported in Haiti, including a 26-year-old man who drowned trying to rescue a child who fell into a rushing river, authorities said. The child was saved. Two people died in Petit Goave, including a woman who was by a falling electrical pole, reported the mayor of the town, according to the Associated Press. 
 
 Four deaths were recorded in the neighboring Dominican Republic, including three children, and one each in Colombia and in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

139,"A member of the NYPD crime scene unit enters the Sofitel hotel in New York, Saturday, May 14, 2011. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the leader of the International Monetary Fund and a possible candidate for president... (Associated Press) 
 
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn's reputation with women earned him the nickname ""the great seducer,"" and not even an affair with a subordinate could knock the International Monetary Fund leader off a political path pointed in the direction of the French presidency. All that changed with charges that he sexually assaulted a maid in his hotel room, a case that generated shock and revulsion, especially in his home country. 
 
 Police said the maid picked Strauss-Kahn out of a lineup. Unless the charges are quickly dropped, they could destroy his chances in a presidential race that is just starting to heat up. 
 
 The IMF, which plays a key role in efforts to control the European debt crisis, named an acting leader and said it remains ""fully functioning and operational"" despite Saturday's arrest of its managing director. 
 
 Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told The Associated Press that his client will plead not guilty. He and another lawyer went in and out of the Harlem police precinct where Strauss-Kahn was being held early Sunday afternoon, and declined to answer reporters' questions until the arraignment, which was expected later Sunday. 
 
 ""He denies all the charges against him,"" Brafman said. ""And that's all I can really say right now."" 
 
 Brafman is one of the city's most high-profile defense attorneys. His clients have included mobsters and such celebrities as Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs and ex-New York Giants star Plaxico Burress. 
 
 Strauss-Kahn, 62, was arrested less than four hours after the alleged assault, plucked from first class on a Paris-bound Air France flight that was just about to leave the gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport. 
 
 The white-haired, well-dressed, thrice-married father of four was alone when he checked into the luxury Sofitel hotel, not far from Manhattan's Times Square, on Friday afternoon, police said. It wasn't clear why he was in New York. The IMF is based in Washington, and he had been due in Germany on Sunday to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
 
 The 32-year-old maid told authorities that when she entered his spacious, $3,000-a-night suite early Saturday afternoon, she thought it was unoccupied. Instead, Strauss-Kahn emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway and pulled her into a bedroom, where he sexually assaulted her, New York Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said. 
 
 The woman told police she fought him off, but then he dragged her into the bathroom, where he forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear. The woman was able to break free again, escaped the room and told hotel staff what had happened, authorities said. 
 
 Strauss-Kahn was gone by the time detectives arrived moments later. He left his cellphone behind. ""It looked like he got out of there in a hurry,"" Browne said. 
 
 The NYPD discovered he was at JFK and contacted officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport. Port Authority police officers arrested him. 
 
 The maid was taken by police to a hospital and was treated for minor injuries. Stacy Royal, a spokeswoman for Sofitel, said the hotel's staff was cooperating in the investigation and that the maid ""has been a satisfactory employee of the hotel for the past three years."" 
 
 Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment. Authorities were looking for any forensic evidence and DNA. 
 
 His wife, Anne Sinclair, defended him in a statement to French news agency AFP. 
 
 ""I do not believe for one second the accusations brought against my husband. I have no doubt his innocence will be established,"" said Sinclair, a New York-born journalist who hosted a popular weekly TV news broadcast in France in the 1980s. 
 
 A member of France's Socialist party, Strauss-Kahn was widely considered the strongest potential challenger next year to President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose political fortunes have been flagging. 
 
 ""At the top of the polls,"" Strauss-Kahn tweeted proudly in French last December, linking an article that showed him ahead in opinion polls when French voters were asked whom they would choose in a primary. At a soccer game in a Washington suburb last September, he, his wife and others were seen wearing T-shirts that read, ""Yes we Kahn,"" a play on Barack Obama's 2008 campaign slogan, ""Yes we can."" 
 
 Strauss-Kahn also noted that he trailed only Warren Buffett and Bill Gates on a list of 100 ""global thinkers"" compiled last November by Foreign Policy magazine. Strauss-Kahn was cited for his ""steely vision at a moment of crisis"" _ for convincing Germany to help bail out Greece's debt-laden government, and for helping to put the brakes on defaults in Hungary, Pakistan and Ukraine. 
 
 The arrest could throw the long-divided Socialists back into disarray about who they could present as Sarkozy's opponent. Even some of his adversaries were stunned. 
 
 ""It's totally hallucinating. If it is true, this would be a historic moment, but in the negative sense, for French political life,"" said Dominique Paille, a political rival to Strauss-Kahn on the center right, on BFM television. Still, he urged, ""I hope that everyone respects the presumption of innocence. I cannot manage to believe this affair."" 
 
 Candidates need to announce their intentions this summer to run in fall primary elections. 
 
 ""If he's cleared, he could return _ but if he is let off only after four or five months, he won't be able to run"" because the campaign will be too far along, said Jerome Fourquet of the IFOP polling agency. 
 
 ""I think his political career is over,"" Philippe Martinat, who wrote a book called ""DSK-Sarkozy: The Duel,"" told The Associated Press. ""Behind him he has other affairs ... I don't see very well how he can pick himself back up."" 
 
 Strauss-Kahn is known as DSK in France, but media there also have dubbed him ""the great seducer."" His reputation as a charmer of women has not hurt his career in France, where politicians' private lives traditionally come under less scrutiny than in the United States. 
 
 In 2008, Strauss-Kahn was briefly investigated over whether he had an improper relationship with a subordinate female employee. The IMF board found that the relationship was consensual, but called his actions ""regrettable"" and said they ""reflected a serious error of judgment."" 
 
 Strauss-Kahn issued an apology, writing in an email to IMF staff that he showed poor judgment but didn't abuse his position. 
 
 The sexual assault allegations come amid French media reports about Strauss-Kahn's lifestyle, including luxury cars and suits, that some have dubbed a smear campaign. Some French raised suspicions about the sexual assault case as well. 
 
 ""Perhaps this affair will unravel very quickly, if we learn that there is in the end no serious charge and that what was said by this woman was not true, and we all wish for this,"" former Socialist Party boss Francois Hollande said on Canal-Plus television. ""To commit an act of such seriousness, this does not resemble the man I know."" 
 
 At La Rotonde, a cafe on Paris' Left Bank, psychiatrist Sylvie Etienne said Strauss-Kahn's alleged behavior is very sad because he had had a ""great chance"" of becoming president. Her daughter, high school literature teacher Stephanie Plou, said it was probably for the best. 
 
 ""This had to come out one day. Better now than when he's president,"" she said. 
 
 A former economics professor, Strauss-Kahn served as French industry minister and finance minister in the 1990s, and is credited with preparing France for the adoption of the euro by taming its deficit. 
 
 He took over as head of the IMF in November 2007. The 187-nation lending agency provides help in the form of emergency loans for countries facing severe financial problems. 
 
 Sarkozy, who did not comment publicly Sunday, had championed Strauss-Kahn to run the IMF. Political strategists saw it as a way for Sarkozy to get a potential challenger far from the French limelight. 
 
 Caroline Atkinson, an IMF spokeswoman, issued a statement Sunday that said the agency would have no comment on the New York case. She referred all inquiries to Strauss-Kahn's personal lawyer and said the ""IMF remains fully functioning and operational."" 
 
 Another IMF spokesman, William Murray, said the fund's executive board would be briefed on developments related to Strauss-Kahn on Sunday, and John Lipsky, the IMF's first deputy managing director, would lead the organization in an acting capacity in Strauss-Kahn's absence. 
 
 Strauss-Kahn was supposed to be meeting in Berlin on Sunday with Merkel about increasing aid to Greece, and then join EU finance ministers in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday. The IMF is responsible for one-third of Greece's existing loan package, and his expected presence at these meetings underlined the gravity of the Greek crisis.

 Charlton reported from Paris. Associated Press writers Cristian Salazar and Verena Dobnik in New York, Martin Crutsinger in Washington and Elaine Ganley in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| “Things like getting things from under the fingernails,” a law enforcement official explained, “the classic things you get in association with a sex assault.” 
 
 The official, who insisted on anonymity because the investigation was continuing, added that since the authorities believed there was a high likelihood that Mr. Strauss-Kahn would be allowed to post bail, investigators feared that he might leave the country with whatever clues his person might yield. 
 
 As the court order was being sought, the woman who told the police on Saturday that she had been attacked by Mr. Strauss-Kahn identified him in the lineup, the police said. 
 
 After identifying Mr. Strauss-Kahn about 4:30 p.m., the woman, a maid at the Sofitel New York on West 44th Street, where Mr. Strauss-Kahn was a guest, left the Special Victims Unit in a police van. A blanket was covering her head. 
 
 The police were called to the hotel about 1:30 on Saturday, but when they arrived, Mr. Strauss-Kahn had already checked out. At some point, Mr. Strauss-Kahn called the hotel and said that his cellphone was missing. Police detectives then coached hotel employees to tell him, falsely, that they had the telephone, according to the law enforcement official. Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he was at Kennedy Airport and about to get on a plane. 
 
 The police have provided few details about the woman at the center of the case beyond saying she was 32 and an African immigrant. 
 
 According to the law enforcement official, the woman entered Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s suite early Saturday afternoon by saying “housekeeping.” She heard no answer and believed that the suite was unoccupied. She left the door open behind her, as is hotel policy.

 She went to the bedroom and a naked man rushed from the bathroom to the bedroom. She apologized, the law enforcement official said, and tried to leave. 
 
 But according to the official, the man chased her, grabbed her and shut the door, locking it. He then pulled her toward the bedroom, the official said, and tried to attack her there.

 He dragged her to the bathroom, the official added, and forced her to perform oral sex. The police said the woman eventually escaped from the suite and reported the attack to other hotel personnel, who called 911. 
 
 The woman lives in the Bronx with a daughter who is in her teens. The building’s superintendent said she moved in a few months ago. 
 
 “They’re good people,” said one neighbor, another African immigrant. “Every time I see her I’m happy because we’re both from Africa. She’s never given a problem for nobody. Never noisy. Everything nice.” 
 
 At the Sofitel New York, a maid, who refused to give her name, described the woman as friendly. “In the world, she is a good person,” she said. 
 
 The maid added that her superiors had asked other hotel employees not to question the woman about what happened. 
 
 “The office said, ‘Don’t ask too much because she is sad,’ ” the maid said. “Just give her a hug when she comes back.” 
 
 A guest at the hotel, Mortem Meier, 36, a sales director visiting from Norway, said the livery driver who drove Mr. Strauss-Kahn to Kennedy Airport was also his driver on Saturday night.

 “He said Strauss-Kahn was in a huge hurry,” Mr. Meier recalled. “He wanted to leave as soon as possible. He looked upset and stressed, the driver said.” 
 
 At Criminal Court downtown on Sunday, crowds of reporters kept watch throughout the day for Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s arraignment, sitting through dozens of more prosaic cases involving offenses like subway fare jumping, marijuana possession and, in one instance, charges of possession of a stun gun. 
 
 Journalists began arriving at the courthouse in the morning and their numbers increased as the day went on. By the time the night court session broke for dinner at 9, more than 60 reporters — many working for French newspapers, television stations and wire services — had assembled and were taking up most of the space on the long wooden benches that lined the rear of the courtroom. 
 
 Ira Judelson, a bail bondsman involved in the case, said earlier in the day that a comprehensive bail package would establish specifics of where Mr. Strauss-Kahn would stay as the case proceeded. He added that the bail amount could be in the millions of dollars.

140,"SYDNEY (AP) — A South Korean-born Sydney man was charged Sunday with acting as an economic agent for North Korea in Australia by allegedly attempting to broker sales worth tens of millions of dollars for Pyongyang that included components used in ballistic missiles. 
 
 The Australian Federal Police said 59-year-old naturalized Australian Chan Han Choi used encrypted communication to broker sales and discuss the supply of weapons of mass destruction. His actions contravened both United Nations and Australian sanctions against North Korea, police said. 
 
 Police said the man was acting to generate income for Pyongyang by arranging the sale of computer software used for guiding ballistic missiles as well as expertise from North Korea to other ""international entities."" Police didn't elaborate. 
 
 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had been briefed by AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin on the ""very, very serious matter"" and warned anyone thinking of assisting North Korea that ""the AFP will find you."" 
 
 ""North Korea is a dangerous, reckless, criminal regime threatening the peace of the region,"" Turnbull said. ""It supports itself by breaching U.N. sanctions, not simply by selling commodities like coal and other goods, but also by selling weapons, by selling drugs, by engaging in cybercrime."" 
 
 He added: ""It is vitally important that all nations work relentlessly to enforce those sanctions because the more economic pressure that can be brought on North Korea, the sooner that regime will be brought to its senses."" 
 
 Despite international sanctions, cash-strapped North Korea last month test-fired its most powerful missile that may be able to target the U.S. mainland. 
 
 Choi is facing six charges related to brokering the sale of missile componentry and expertise from North Korea to other international entities, and attempting to transfer coal from North Korea to entities in Indonesia and Vietnam. 
 
 Choi didn't appear or apply for bail in a Sydney court Sunday, and bail was formally refused. 
 
 Federal police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said the governments of Indonesia and Vietnam — or authorities in those countries — were not involved in the coal transfer attempt. 
 
 Choi is the first person charged under Australia's Weapons of Mass Destruction Act and could face a maximum 10-year prison sentence. 
 
 Gaughan said the charges related to his alleged activity over the past year, but that allegations dated back to 2008. 
 
 Choi was arrested Saturday and charged over two transactions that were unsuccessful. ""But we estimate that if these trades were successful, we're talking tens of millions of dollars,"" Gaughan told reporters. 
 
 He said investigations were continuing and that more charges could be filed against Choi. 
 
 ""The AFP are saying this man was a loyal agent of North Korea, believing he was acting to serve some high patriotic purpose,"" Gaughan said. 
 
 Police started investigating Choi after a tip-off from another international agency on another matter, he said. 
 
 ""I know these charges sound alarming, but we are not suggesting that there are any weapons or missile componentry that came to Australian soil,"" he said. ""We're alleging all of the activity occurred offshore."" 
 
 Choi's activities also involved commodities including oil and gemstones. 
 
 ""This is black market 101. It's the same with the coal and oil and gemstones — it's all about making money for North Korea,"" he said, adding the case was ""like nothing we have ever seen on Australian soil."" 
 
 ""Any individual who attempts to fly in the face of sanctions cannot and will not go unnoticed in Australia,"" he said. ||||| Mr. Choi was a naturalized Australian citizen who had lived in the country for more than 30 years, the police said. They did not elaborate, but some Australian news media reports said he was born in South Korea. 
 
 “We think he’s acting as an economic agent on behalf of North Korea,” Mr. Gaughan said at a news conference. “He’s doing it out of a patriotic purpose. I think at the end of the day, he’d sell whatever he could to make money back for the North Korean government.”

 The police said evidence suggested that Mr. Choi had been in “contact with high-ranking officials in North Korea” but would not comment further. 
 
 Mr. Choi was also charged with attempting to sell North Korean coal in countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the police said, adding that there was no evidence of involvement by those countries’ governments or officials. Such sales would violate international sanctions aimed at cutting off North Korea from the global economy. 
 
 The investigation started this year after the police received information from a foreign law enforcement partner about a different matter. 
 
 After months of “careful and methodical” investigation, the police said, they uncovered evidence that led them to believe that Mr. Choi was working to generate income for the North Korean government from abroad as recently as this year. 
 
 If he is found guilty, Mr. Choi could face up to 10 years in prison. 
 
 “He seems to be a fellow traveler willing to take the risk to try and exploit whatever loopholes exist with surveillance and sanctions,” said Euan Graham, the director of the international security program at the Lowy Institute. “It means the North Koreans are still trying to access whatever componentry they can, even in a high-risk country like Australia.”

 For years, North Korea has found ways to skirt sanctions to obtain technology and earn hard currency by selling not just weapons but also counterfeit money and drugs. 
 
 North Korea no longer has an embassy in Australia in part because of one such moneymaking mission gone wrong: In 2003, the Pong Su, a North Korean cargo ship that ran aground on an Australian beach, was found to be filled with about 275 pounds of heroin. The crew was arrested and later deported, and the North Korean embassy closed five years later. 
 
 When North Korea asked for it to be reopened in 2013, Australia refused. 
 
 Mr. Gaughan, the police official, called Mr. Choi’s arrest a sign of Australia’s commitment to upholding international sanctions on North Korea. 
 
 “This investigation shows that the United Nations and Australian sanctions will be rigorously enforced in Australia,” he said.","– Australia on Saturday arrested one of its own citizens and charged him with acting as an economic agent on behalf of North Korea in attempting to sell the Hermit Kingdom's missile technology, reports the New York Times.

 Deputy Nick Mahoney says officers arrived to find three men fatally shot. The neighborhood is in an unincorporated part of the county about 20 miles southeast of Tulsa.

 BROKEN ARROW, Okla. (KTUL) -- One person is in custody after three suspects in a Wagoner County home invasion were shot to death Monday afternoon by one of the residents. 
 
 According to the Wagoner County Sheriff's Office, the suspects' getaway driver has been arrested. The 21-year-old woman, Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, turned herself in at the Broken Arrow Police Department hours after the shooting, saying she had information. Wagoner County investigators interviewed her at the police department and subsequently arrested her on complaints of three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of first-degree burglary. 
 
 Investigators haven't released the names of anyone involved but say the deceased suspects are between 16 and 18 years old. One of the suspects had a knife and another had brass knuckles, according to investigators. 
 
 
 
 Deputies responded to the home near 9100 S. Clearview Drive around 12:30 p.m. after a report of a possible home invasion with shots fired. Upon arrival, deputies found three suspects dead and the two residents uninjured. 
 
 Deputy Nick Mahoney says the preliminary investigation shows that the three suspects went to the residence with the intent to burglarize the home. 
 
 ""They were dressed in black, all had masks on, and all had gloves on,"" said Mahoney. 
 
 Mahoney says the suspects broke in through a glass door in the back of the house. After entering the residence, the suspects encountered the homeowner's 23-year-old son, who also lives there. The resident was carrying an AR-15. 
 
 
 
 ""There was a short exchange of words and then gunfire happened,"" he said. 
 
 
 
 A neighbor down the road said the gunshots sounded like a storm. 
 
 ""Well, I thought it was thunder, I just heard something, I had the doors closed,"" said Leon Simmons. 
 
 
 
 Two suspects died in the kitchen, and a third ran from the home but collapsed and died in the driveway. 
 
 Both residents are cooperating with investigators. The homeowner's son volunteered to go to the sheriff's office to give a statement. 
 
 ""Preliminary investigation, it looks like it was self-defense,"" Mahoney said. 
 
 
 
 Residents in the neighborhood say they've seen an increase in break-ins recently. 
 
 
 
 ""Within the past six months we've had two or three burglaries out here,"" said Simmons.

 She reportedly admitted to planning the robbery and driving the vehicle. 
 
 Investigators say Rodriguez and the deceased suspects burglarized a spare apartment at Peters' home earlier in the day, then returned later to rob the main house. 
 
 One of the injured suspects reportedly exited the home during the incident and tried to get back in to Rodriguez's vehicle, but she told investigators she drove away and left him in the driveway. 
 
 The investigation is ongoing, and charges may not be filed for days because of the complexity of the case.

Police say that after the three suspects broke in through a glass door at the back of the home Monday afternoon, there was a ""short exchange of words"" with the homeowner's 23-year-old son before he opened fire with an AR-15 assault rifle, KTUL reports. Two suspects died in the home's kitchen. A third fled before collapsing and dying in the home's driveway. Police say that hours after the shooting, Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, 21, turned herself in. She was arrested and is expected to face three charges of first-degree murder and three charges of burglary. (In Oklahoma, those suspected in a felony that results in a death can face charges of murder.) Wagoner County Deputy Nick Mahoney says the three teenagers were wearing black clothing, masks, and gloves when they broke into the home, the AP reports. Two of the suspects were 17 years old and the third was 18, reports FOX23. One suspect had brass knuckles and another had a knife, according to police, who say the homeowners called authorities and voluntarily provided statements. Police say there's no indication that the suspects knew the homeowner or his son. They say that, for now, the shooting is being treated as self-defense. ""This may be a case of 'stand-your-ground'; however, it's still too early to say for sure, and we're still looking into all aspects of this,"" Mahoney says, per the Tulsa World.",<pad> – Oklahoma authorities say three would-be burglars have been fatally shot by a homeowner's adult son who was armed with a rifle. The Wagoner County Sheriff's Office received a call around 12:30pm Monday from someone inside a home who told dispatchers that people had broken into the house and that shots had been fired. Deputy Nick Mahoney says officers arrived to find three men fatally shot. The neighborhood is in an unincorporated part of the county about 20 miles southeast of Tulsa.

142,"Police in New York City on Friday released surveillance video of the woman suspected of pushing a man to his death in front of a subway train, the second such crime in the city this month. 
 
 The video shows the woman running from the elevated platform Thursday night. Witnesses told police she had been following the man closely and mumbling to herself. She got up from a nearby bench and shoved him as the train pulled in. 
 
 It did not appear the man noticed her, police said. They said the condition of the man's body was making it difficult to identify him. 
 
 The woman was described as Hispanic, in her 20s and heavyset. 
 
 It was unclear if the man and the woman knew each other or if anyone tried to help the man before he was struck and killed at the station in the borough of Queens. 
 
 It was the second time this month someone had been shoved to their death on subway tracks. 
 
 On Dec. 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was pushed in front of a train in Times Square. A photograph of him on the tracks a split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New York Post the next day, causing an uproar and debate over whether the photographer, who had been waiting for a train, should have tried to help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image. 
 
 A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and has said that Han had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before. 
 
 Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many commuters who ride the city's subway, which carries more than 5.2 million riders on an average weekday. But deaths are rare. ||||| A young woman pushed a man to his death under an oncoming train at the 40th Street-Lowery Street subway station in Sunnyside, Queens, on Thursday evening, law enforcement authorities said. 
 
 The woman got up from her seat, walked behind the man along the platform, mumbling to herself, witnesses told the police, before shoving him into the path of a Flushing-bound No. 7 train just after 8 p.m. Witnesses said the victim did not appear to notice her. 
 
 The man, whom the police have not yet identified, was pushed with little time to avoid the hurtling train, or for others to come to his aid, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. His body remained under the second car of the 11-car train, which officers from the Emergency Services Unit planned to lift using specialized inflatable bags to recover his remains. 
 
 “We haven’t determined whether it was random or if there was some connection yet,” Mr. Browne said, “but there was nothing from what the witnesses could see to indicate that they knew each other and he did not, according to the witnesses, appear to realize that she was approaching.” 
 
 The woman, whom the police described as Hispanic, in her early 20s and heavyset, fled on Queens Boulevard and was being sought. 
 
 Outside the elevated station on Thursday night, multiple police vehicles gathered, and local residents braved frigid conditions to huddle on corners and discuss the act of violence in their midst. Three police trucks sat lined up along the tracks, lights flashing against the backdrop of a string of white Christmas lights. 
 
 Investigators were unable to immediately determine much about the victim from his body beyond his gender, Mr. Browne said. He was not carrying identification. 
 
 Giovanni Briones, 44, the owner of the Oasis Restaurant on 40th Street and Queens Boulevard, said the police were able to obtain clear images of the suspect from his 24-hour cameras pointed toward the subway stairs. 
 
 “She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,” he said, describing the video he provided to detectives. He said he did not recognize the woman. 
 
 “I’m sure they are going to get her,” he said. “There are a lot of sick people out there — mentally ill. It’s very sad,” he said. Residents in the area were still shaken, he added, by an earlier episode in the summer in which a man killed his wife and jumped from the tracks at the same subway stop. 
 
 In the restaurant, another woman anxiously described her husband, whom she had not heard from, for a police officer. She was overjoyed when he called a few minutes later. 
 
 Mr. Briones said one of his regular customers was on the train. She told him later that “she felt a bump as the train ran over the man,” he said. 
 
 The No. 7 line was shut down between Court Square and 61 Street-Woodside Avenue, Deirdre Parker, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said late Thursday, and would reopen only when the police had concluded their investigation there. 
 
 It is the second time this month that a man has been killed after being pushed onto the subway tracks. Ki-Suck Han, 58, of Elmhurst, Queens, died under the Q train at the 49th Street and Seventh Avenue station in early December. Naeem Davis, 30, has been charged with second-degree murder in that case. A lawyer for Mr. Davis said that his client had been trying to push Mr. Han away after an altercation.","– For the second time this month, a man has been killed after being shoved onto New York City subway tracks.

143,"At least 200,000 Americans die needlessly each year due to heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure, and more than half of these deaths occur in people younger than 65, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 
 All of these premature deaths could be prevented by quitting smoking, controlling blood pressure, keeping cholesterol levels in check and taking aspirin when recommended by a physician, public health experts said. 
 
 ""These findings are really striking. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of deaths that don't have to happen,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. ""It's possible for us to make rapid and substantial progress in reducing these deaths."" 
 
 In the United States, about 800,000 people die of cardiovascular disease each year, according to the study published Tuesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death, and stroke is No. 4; along with hypertensive disease, they account for nearly 30% of all U.S. deaths, the CDC says. 
 
 Overall, the avoidable death rate for cardiovascular disease dropped 29% between 2001 and 2010, CDC researchers found. But that improvement was not shared equally by Americans of all ages, racial and ethnic backgrounds and states of residence. 
 
 For instance, the rate of avoidable deaths dropped 25% for people ages 65 to 74, yet it remained largely unchanged for people younger than 65, epidemiologist Linda Schieb and her colleagues discovered. 
 
 Also, the avoidable death rate among African Americans was 107 per 100,000 people — nearly twice the rate of 58 per 100,000 for whites and more than triple the rate of 34 per 100,000 for Asians and Pacific Islanders. The rate for Latinos was 45 per 100,000. The study's authors cautioned, however, that avoidable death rates for nonwhites and nonblacks may be underestimated due to inaccurate reporting on death certificates. 
 
 Across all races and ethnic groups, men had the highest risk of death, roughly double that of women. 
 
 The counties with the highest avoidable death rates were concentrated in the nation's Southern states, in a region that has long been described by health officials as the nation's ""stroke belt."" In 2010, states with the highest avoidable death rates included Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Louisiana. The study's authors cited high-sodium diets, lack of sidewalks and bike lanes and poor accessibility to quality healthcare as contributing factors. 
 
 ""It's unfortunate, but your longevity may be more likely to be influenced by your ZIP Code than by your genetic code,"" Frieden said. 
 
 The study's authors speculated that some of the disparities were the result of uneven access to health insurance. The fact that Medicare eligibility begins at the age of 65 may help explain why people in the 65-74 age group were able to reduce premature deaths caused by heart disease and stroke while younger Americans did not. (The study excluded people older than 75 in its analysis of preventable deaths because average life expectancy in the U.S. is 78.7 years.) 
 
 Smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet and excessive use of alcohol increased the risk of cardiovascular disease in all individuals, regardless of race, age and location, study authors noted. 
 
 ""Many heart disease and stroke deaths could be avoided through improvements in lifestyle behaviors,"" they wrote. 
 
 monte.morin@latimes.com ||||| Nearly 1 in 3 deaths in the US each year is caused by heart disease and stroke. At least 200,000 of these deaths could have been prevented through changes in health habits, such as stopping smoking, more physical activity, and less salt in the diet; community changes to create healthier living spaces, such as safe places to exercise and smoke-free areas; and managing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. 
 
 More people will have access to health care coverage and preventive care through the Affordable Care Act. Health care providers should talk with their patients about healthy habits at every visit and follow patients’ progress. 
 
 Health care systems and providers can also: 
 
 Use electronic health records to identify and support patients who need help quitting smoking or who have high blood pressure or high cholesterol. 
 
 Refer patients to community resources, such as smoking quitlines and blood pressure selfmanagement programs. 
 
 Track patient progress on the ABCS of heart health—Aspirin when appropriate, Blood pressure control, Cholesterol management, and Smoking cessation. 
 
 *Preventable (avoidable) deaths are defined as those from ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic rheumatic heart disease, and hypertensive disease in people under age 75, although changes in health habits and the health care system can reduce death among all ages. ||||| Important progress has been made, but more is needed to continue to save lives, particularly for people under 65 years

144,"Kenny Says Ireland Will Not Default as Greece Concerns Mount 
 
 By Joe Brennan and Andrea Catherwood 
 
 (Updates shares, bonds in eighth paragraph.) 
 
 April 18 (Bloomberg) -- Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said the nation won’t default on its debt as he tries to rebuild confidence at a time when investors speculate Greece may struggle to pay back its borrowings. 
 
 “The Greek government will obviously deal with this problem in the best way it can,” said Kenny, 59, in an interview with Andrea Catherwood on Bloomberg Television’s “Last Word” in London today. “We have no intention of defaulting. We’ve made that perfectly clear. We want to continue to pay our way.” 
 
 Irish, Greek and Portuguese bonds fell today amid mounting speculation Greece will have to restructure its debt. All three countries have sought bailouts from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, and Kenny’s government wants a reduction on the rate on its loans, which he has described as “too severe.” 
 
 “We’re not looking for more money from Europe, we’re looking for greater flexibility,” Kenny said, referring to the rate on the bailout and to medium-term financing for lenders from the European Central Bank. He also said that an increase in Ireland’s 12.5 percent corporation-tax rate to appease fellow EU leaders is “not up for negotiation.” 
 
 Ireland’s government last month pledged to inject additional capital of as much as 24 billion euros ($34 billion) into lenders after mounting losses forced the country ask for external help in November. Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on April 8 it’s important to reach an agreement on lower bailout rates before the country taps “serious tranches of money.” 
 
 Bonds Fall 
 
 Kenny said that Anglo Irish Bank Corp., which is being wound down, may not need further capital. Ireland has injected 29.3 billion euros into the nationalized lender over the past two years. He also said its senior bondholders may be treated differently than those at Allied Irish Banks Plc and Bank of Ireland Plc, which the government says won’t have losses imposed on them. 
 
 “The indications are that it won’t need extra capital,” Kenny said, ahead of a planned update in May on the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish and smaller rival Irish Nationwide Building Society. “We’ve made it perfectly clear that senior bondholders in Anglo Irish and INBS” are a “different category” to those in Ireland’s other banks, he said. 
 
 Irish bonds fell today, pushing the yield on the country’s 10-year debt to 9.76 percent at the close of trading in London, the highest in two weeks. The yield on Greek and Portuguese bonds of the same maturity rose to euro-era records. European shares declined, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropping 1.7 percent. 
 
 Kenny said Ireland’s government has “plenty of time” before interest payments due in October or November “to demonstrate the seriousness of intent” about tackling the country’s banking and fiscal problems. 
 
 “We believe that growth projections and initiatives that were taken will lead Ireland to a position where we fix what’s been broken” and generate economic growth, he said.

 German government sources told Reuters in Berlin that they did not believe Greece, which sealed a 110 billion euro ($158 billion) bailout from the EU and IMF a year ago, would make it through the summer without a restructuring. 
 
 Market confidence was also hit by a new threat to Portugal's pending bailout from the rise of an anti-euro party in Finnish elections. 
 
 The anti-euro True Finns party scored big gains in a Sunday vote and vowed to push for changes to a Portuguese rescue by the EU that is expected to total 80 billion euros when it is finalized by a mid-May deadline. 
 
 After a brief lull in the EU debt crisis at the start of 2011, it has blown up again and some analysts are now openly speculating that Greece and possibly other countries could eventually be forced to exit the bloc. 
 
 ""You may see some countries deciding to leave the euro because they can't deal with the fiscal straitjacket that it imposes on them,"" Andrew Lynch, a fund manager at Schroders, told Reuters Insider. 
 
 A restructuring of Greek debt would be the first by a west European nation in over half a century and represents a challenge for EU policymakers struggling to reconcile the interests of their citizens with the costly steps needed to preserve the integrity of the 17-nation currency area. 
 
 Greece, saddled with a debt burden that is expected to swell to 160 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, has denied repeatedly that it plans to restructure. Bank of Greece Governor George Provopoulos warned on Monday it would have ""catastrophic consequences."" 
 
 ""To be clear, Greece has money,"" when considering the public wealth that could be privatized, ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi told Reuters Insider before a New York event sponsored by Chatham House, the home of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. 
 
 ""You have the alternative of selling assets and accelerating privatization or going in the direction of major financial collapse, which would happen in the case of default or restructuring."" 
 
 But German newspaper Die Welt quoted an unnamed Greek minister as saying it was only a matter of time before the government took such a step. 
 
 And government sources in Berlin told Reuters that some form of debt restructuring now looked unavoidable and suggested Greece move fast, rather than wait until its funding situation gets critical next year. 
 
 ""Decisive voices within the federal government expect that Greece will not make it through the summer without a restructuring,"" a high-ranking German coalition source said. 
 
 CONTAGION RISK 
 
 European shares sank to their lowest close in three weeks on Monday and the euro fell more than two cents to trade briefly below $1.42, its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in nearly two weeks as the euro zone debt crisis rattled market confidence. 
 
 U.S. stocks also took a hit after Standard & Poor's cut its credit outlook for the United States to negative in a reminder that the euro zone is not alone in suffering from high debt and deficits. 
 
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default jumped and Spanish 10-year bond yields rose toward record highs near 5.6 percent, while Portuguese yields hit a new peak of 9.4 percent. 
 
 European officials have been at pains to stress that Spain can avoid the contagion that has forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek rescues. Its much larger economy could strain the bloc's resources to breaking point if it did succumb to the need for a debt bailout. 
 
 Data on Monday showed an accelerated drop in Spanish housing prices in the first quarter and a surge in yields at a government treasury bill auction. 
 
 Spain faces a further test of demand for its debt on Wednesday when it aims to raise 2.5 to 3.5 billion euros with two long-maturity issues. 
 
 GREEK DEBT BIGGER THAN ARGENTINA BEFORE DEFAULT 
 
 In order to return Greece's economy to a sustainable path, most economists agree that it needs to write off roughly half the value of its outstanding debt, hitting private creditors with significant ""haircuts"" on their holdings. 
 
 Greece's debt load of 325 billion euros is nearly double the level most economists see as sustainable and far bigger than that of Argentina when it defaulted in late 2001. 
 
 But EU leaders have promised not to make private debt holders pay before 2013. 
 
 Doing so in the near-term, when the bloc remains vulnerable, could raise pressure on Portugal and Ireland to restructure their debt also, threatening bank balance sheets in the euro zone. 
 
 Winning creditor agreement for a milder form of restructuring, like a voluntary extension of debt maturities, is likely to be difficult. 
 
 And even if it does work, it would probably not make enough of a dent in Greece's debt burden to ensure sustainability over the longer-term. Markets may view the ""restructuring lite"" option as merely the first step in a two-stage restructuring, with the real pain yet to come. 
 
 PORTUGAL BAILOUT AT RISK 
 
 Meanwhile, in neighboring Portugal, representatives of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund were meeting government officials on Monday to set the terms for the bloc's third rescue in a year following multi-billion euro deals for Greece and Ireland. 
 
 After the election in Finland, however, that bailout could come under threat. 
 
 The anti-euro True Finns party which scored big gains in the Sunday vote, vowed to push for changes to the Portuguese rescue. 
 
 It may take weeks to find out whether True Finns will become part of a new government in Helsinki and be able to deliver on that threat. The party that won the most votes in Finland is pro-European and seems unlikely to compromise its stance even if it does end up in a coalition with True Finns. 
 
 But the result underscored the extent of public anger in northern Europe at the series of aid deals for stricken euro zone countries that mismanaged their economies and finances. 
 
 ""It is extremely difficult for politicians in Europe to ignore the strong signal from Finland,"" said Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank. ""Ultimately this could mean a move away from bailouts with no burden sharing by private investors and banks."" 
 
 Any delay in approving the bailout deal for Portugal beyond May could leave the country scrambling for new sources of funding. It faces an election on June 5 and has warned it will run out of money around the same time.

 A Long Island high school teen hoped her anti-bullying video would make an impact, and it did — she was suspended. Now school officials say they're lifting the punishment. 
 
 Jessica Barba, 15, wrote, filmed and acted in the video for an assignment on persuasive speech at Longwood High School in Middle Island. 
 
 The video tells the story of a fictitious character, 12-year-old ‘Hailey Bennett,’ played by Jessica, who becomes depressed after she’s repeatedly bullied at school and online. It ends with a caption saying the girl committed suicide. 
 
 There is a disclaimer at the beginning and end of the video explaining the events are not real. 
 
 The suspension sparked controversey at the school and made national headlines after Jessica and her parents claimed it was unfair. School officials said Thursday they will wipe the suspension from Jessica's record and let her return to school, NBC News reported. 
 
 A spokeswoman told NBC News the school district cannot comment. 
 
 Jessica posted the video on YouTube May 15. The next day, it was the talk of Longwood High. Some students were disturbed by the video and even moved to tears, WNBC/Ch. 4 New York reported. 
 
 She was called into the principal’s office expecting to be praised for doing a great job on the project, but instead was suspended for five days. 
 
 “I was baffled. I couldn’t even describe how I was feeling,” she told the station. ‘I started hysterically crying. I couldn’t believe I was getting in trouble for something I had worked so hard on. And the only intent of it was good.”

 Jessica also created a Facebook page for the bullied girl, which she said was labeled as fiction. The page is full of hateful messages meant to depict cyber-bullying in the video. 
 
 On the page the character, ‘Hailey,’ posted alarming comments like “I hate myself” and “I wanna be dead,” WNBC/Ch. 4 reported. 
 
 A concerned parent saw the Facebook page and not realizing it was fake, called police, Jessica’s parents told the “Today” show during an appearance Wednesday. 
 
 The page was taken down by the school. 
 
 The superintendent of Longwood School District released a statement saying the video was “unfortunate in that it created a substantial disruption to the school,” WNBC/Ch. 4 reported. He said he could not comment further on a matter involving a student. 
 
 Meanwhile the teen did not back down, and told the station she believes the video highlights an important issue. “I just created the video in order to raise awareness of the major issue that’s bullying,” Jessica told “Today.” 
 
 The school held a suspension hearing Thursday and decided to let Jessica return to school. They will also wipe the suspension from her record.

146,"Thomas van Linge’s colorful, detailed maps showing which parties control which parts of Iraq, Libya and Syria are a hit whenever he posts them on Twitter. They have been cited on news stories in the Huffington Post, Lebanon’s Daily Star and Vox, as well as on the University of Texas at Austin’s website. But van Linge isn’t a policy expert and he’s never been to the region: In fact, he’s just a Dutch high school student who tracks the war on social media. 
 
 Van Linge, who goes by @arabthomness on Twitter, has amassed nearly 11,000 followers since joining the platform in January 2013, the year he published his first map. Many of his followers work for influential think tanks or suggest policy for the region he maps. 
 
 Van Linge’s latest map of conflict-ridden Syria, updated June 5, 2015, illustrates just how complex the situation in the country has become. In northeastern Syrian Kurdistan, a tip of yellow is mainly in control of the Kurdish YPG (People’s Protection Units), while the country’s west is a mix of red—representing the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad—and varied green blotches representing the Free Syrian Army and mixed rebel and jihadi-controlled countryside. The city of Aleppo is a palette of colors representing myriad forces like Jabhat al-Nusra, Islamic Front and government soldiers vying for power, making normal life for civilians a deadly struggle. 
 
 The rest of Syria is a vast swath of countryside, colored gray, controlled by the militant group Islamic State (ISIS), and punctuated with black circles denoting ISIS-controlled towns and cities. The map is corroborated by news reports from last month that say ISIS now controls around 50 percent of Syria.

 “I want to inform people mostly and show people the rebel dynamics in the country,” Van Linge told Newsweek, referring to his motivation for creating his maps. “I also want to inform journalists who want to go to the region which regions are definitely no-go zones, which regions are the most dangerous, and also to show strategic developments through time.” 
 
 Van Linge’s interest in the region was first sparked by the events of the 2011 Arab Spring, particularly the Egyptian revolution. He started following trends in Libya and Syria and made his first map showing the situation for the YPG and Kurdish forces in Syrian Kurdistan in December 2013. Then someone asked him to make a map of Syria as a whole. 
 
 “I hadn’t really considered it at the time, but I was annoyed by other maps that didn’t make the distinction between rebels and ISIS groups of areas, which were still at the time intertwined,” he said. In the past 16 months, he’s also made maps of Eastern Ukraine, Somalia, the Palestinian territories and the northern part of Mali, which saw fighting between Al-Qaeda and Tuareg rebels, although the Syria maps get the most attention. 
 
 When he starts a new map, which usually takes several weeks to finish alongside his schoolwork, Van Linge takes a large file of a blank map and uses the most humble of tools to start coloring it in: Microsoft Paint. 
 
 “I’m not very sophisticated with computers,” he said. 
 
 Thomas Van Linge/Newsweek 
 
 The sources for Van Linge’s maps include Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, as well as personal contacts in the region, including within the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo and others in the Kurdish region north of Aleppo. He estimates he has around 1,000 sources for all his maps, which he uses to corroborate claims of territorial control. 
 
 “When I see, for example, a status update of a rebel group on Facebook in which they claim they’ve captured a small village, then I usually wait until either other sources report it or footage from rebels within that village shows up on YouTube before I make the edit on my map,” said Van Linge. 
 
 He then uses a map tool on Google Earth to make and edit shapes of controlling territories, like the mint green boomerang shape showing a low amount of rebel-controlled countryside in southwestern Syria, which he replicates in the Paint file. 
 
 The finished product is shared on Twitter and is often retweeted several times. Pieter Van Ostaeyen, the Belgian jihadist expert described by the Financial Times as an “armchair terrorist tracker,” has also started republishing the maps on his website. 
 
 Despite Van Linge’s age and relative inexperience in the world of foreign affairs, some Middle East experts have applaud his maps. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said he finds the maps “among the most useful,” mainly due to the color blocking system employed by Van Linge. Most mapmakers, Landis says, use “spindly strands of highway control” to show the areas run by ISIS, which might underestimate the group’s power. 
 
 “Controlling large swaths of desert, where few people live, is strategically important. No one would make a map of Algeria or Saudi Arabia like this, only ISIS,” said Landis. “By updating his maps frequently and sticking to tradition by trying to depict how much actual territory ISIS controls, Thomas van Linge does us all a favor.” 
 
 Rana Khalaf, a researcher at the Centre for Syrian Studies at St. Andrews University, also found the maps useful, but said it would be helpful to highlight the uninhabited desert regions, as well as to use intersecting lines to show contested areas where control can change overnight. 
 
 Van Ostaeyen, who publishes Van Linge’s maps but primarily uses Twitter to track and communicate with jihadists, also spoke of how helpful the maps are. 
 
 “I found it really interesting to see the evolution of everything going on,” he said. “Thomas’s maps are one of the best published on what’s going on in Syria and Iraq.” 
 
 At the start of their correspondence, Van Ostaeyen didn’t know Van Linge’s age and was impressed when he found out he was a teenager. He wasn’t, however, surprised. 
 
 “I’ve seen so many weird things, like the Shami Witness case [Van Ostaeyen was in close contact with Mehdi Masroor Biswas, the man behind the pro-ISIS account, who was arrested in Bangalore, India, last December], that I can’t be surprised anymore by something,” said Van Ostaeyen. 
 
 Van Linge’s Twitter feed is more than just maps: it’s also a valuable resource for news of ongoing humanitarian crises in the region and around the world. He posts photos of the aftermath of shelling and retweets activists who post graphic photos of children killed by weapons in Syria. He says he does this to raise awareness now that the international media is largely ignoring daily bomb attacks. 
 
 “By tweeting every bombardment, every victim of the Assad regime or ISIS, I believe you’re reminded of these crimes, these events,” said Van Linge. “They’re ongoing everyday even though they don’t make headline news anymore.” ||||| Islamic State fighters have conquered Rahabi in Iraq. They control the Libyan coast near Sirt. In Syria, they just lost Tall Abyad to the Kurds, but are spreading out in the center of Palmyra. Thomas van Linge is keeping an eye on their movements. The 19-year-old wears a hoodie and, although he only just graduated from high school, he already knows better than most people where the Jihadists are heading, which areas they are occupying and where they've been beaten back. That's because van Linge makes some of the world's best maps of chaotic war zones from the desk of his childhood bedroom in Amsterdam. He has never been to Syria, Iraq or Libya, and he learned Arabic on YouTube. 
 
 The young Dutchman isn't just keeping an eye on Islamic State and its ""caliphate,"" he also knows what the rebels of the Free Syrian Army, al-Nusra Front and Lebanon's Hezbollah are doing. In Libya he's monitoring the Zintan Brigades, in Nigeria he's watching Boko Haram, in Eastern Ukraine he's keeping an eye on the separatists. ""All places where people are rising up,"" he says. 
 
 His maps have been used by CNN, the New York Times and even SPIEGEL. The question is: Why is a 19-year-old interested in the situation at Syrian front lines? And how does he manage to depict these conflicts so precisely, with more details than almost any other professional cartographer? 
 
 Thomas van Linge still lives at home, in a small house near Schiphol Airport, where Star Wars DVDs line the shelves. When he looks out the window, he can see hazelnut bushes and a slide in his front yard. He shrugs with his shoulders -- he has no answer to the question. He's a practical person and believes that everyone should just do what interests them. Afraid of failing at something? No, he says. He claims not to know that feeling. 
 
 At school he did theater. He learned the anthroposophical movement art known as eurythmy and completed an internship in a home for senior citizens. He has collected money for species in danger of extinction and memorized the names of all the birds and mammals of central Europe. He attended a school called the Free School, a Waldorf institution where lessons follow the principles of Rudolf Steiner. One of the ideas of these progressive educators is that students shouldn't only be made to learn how to think and feel, but also how to want -- i.e., how to do things. 
 
 Moving into the Real World 
 
 One evening four years ago, van Linge saw a show on CNN about the Arab Spring in Egypt. He saw furious young people fighting for their freedom on Tahrir Square in Cairo. His mother is a psychologist, his father an economist, and they raised him to be a free thinker who views the world as a place of promise. He says he often wished that others were as free as him. 
 
 So he selected the Syrian civil war as the subject for his specialized work at school. He looked up a map of Syria on Google and began inputting front lines and rebel groups. He used different colors. He established contact with activists and gained their trust. They, in turn, sent him information. Then he continued tinkering with the map. In January 2014, he released it for the first time on his Twitter account, @arabthomness. Now he has over 14,000 followers from around the world. He regularly updates the maps. 
 
 A flood of information flows together on his mobile phone from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. He Skypes with fighters on the front, corresponds with activists and charities and even gets messages from other cartographers. In all, he claims to use over 1,100 sources for his Syrian maps. 
 
 Now that he is finished with high school, van Linge has been doing a lot of thinking about what he should do next. He says he's like to work freelance, be outside and travel. During his research he learned about a young Syrian whose parents died. She now needs to take care of her little sister alone. Thomas van Linge often thinks about the two. He knows, he says, that his maps don't help the girls. 
 
 That has inspired him to think about traveling to one of the places soon he so far has only known from his maps -- possibly into the Kurdish region in northeastern Iraq. He believes he's spent enough time monitoring the situation from afar. He feels that it's now time for him to help people where their suffering is actually taking place. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented.

147,"The mortgage-foreclosure crisis spilled into the financial markets on Thursday, driving down bank stocks and weighing on mortgage bonds as investors took a grim view of the potential costs. 
 
 View Full Image Getty Images A bank owned sign hangs in front of a foreclosed home in Miami, Florida. Bank repossessions rose to their highest level in September, exceeding 100,000 in a month for the first time. 
 
 Shares of U.S. banks fell, while the broader stock market was essentially flat. Bank of America Corp., potentially among the most affected, dropped more than 5%. Bank bonds also fell, and the cost of buying protection against a possible debt default by banks climbed. 
 
 ""The level of uncertainty in the economy is at extraordinarily high levels to begin with,"" said Jack Scott, chief investment officer at BlackHawk Capital Management, a Charlotte, N.C., money manager that owns mortgage securities. ""The foreclosure problem adds another layer of acute uncertainty."" 
 
 So far, the foreclosure crisis hasn't affected consumer mortgage rates, which remain near record lows. They are closely linked to rates on U.S. Treasurys, which have tumbled in recent months. 
 
 The crisis has been escalating for several weeks, as banks suspend foreclosures across the country, citing flaws they have uncovered, including faulty or missing documentation. Tales of mismanagement within the foreclosure process—including so-called robo-signers, who were paid to rubber stamp documents without properly reviewing them—are emerging daily. 
 
 Until recently, investors hadn't fled financial stocks. If the issues raised about foreclosure practices in recent days are easily resolved technical glitches, with most foreclosures resuming after brief delays, then the impact on most investors would be small. 
 
 ""The [mortgage] market seems to be functioning relatively well, but that could change depending on how we see this play out,"" said BlackRock Inc. portfolio manager John Vibert. 
 
 But some fear that it may be difficult to do any foreclosures for a while. The risk is that foreclosure flaws are so widespread, or the political furor so heated, that the entire process grinds to a halt, as Citigroup analyst Joshua Levin said in a conference call this week. 
 
 In some cases, that would choke off much of the cash flow used to pay mortgage bondholders. 
 
 Another concern is that banks could be forced to modify billions of dollars in loans, including reducing principal, which could leave bondholders as big losers. 
 
 ""All this does is increase uncertainty and make me question my estimates of returns"" on mortgage bonds, said Mr. Scott of BlackHawk, which bought mortgages that aren't guaranteed by government agencies near the bottom in early 2009. BlackHawk started trimming its mortgage holdings this summer after a run-up. 
 
 PM Report: Foreclosure Mess - How Bad Will It Get? 9:48 Nick Timiraos discusses the unfolding foreclosure-crisis, including how bad it's likely to get, how much it's likely to cost banks and the risk that it could paralyze the housing market. Plus, a health-care ruling and seniors flip for college teams.

 Bank of America CEO Comments on Moratorium 1:16 Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan comments on when the foreclosure moratorium might be lifted and what impact it could have on the housing market, MarketWatch's Val Brickates Kennedy reports from Boston. 
 
 Banks, meanwhile, could be hit with investor lawsuits, and foreclosure delays could bring short-term losses. Some investors are pushing for banks to take back nonperforming mortgages in cases of faulty documentation. 
 
 Such worries helped push down shares of Bank of America on Thursday, in their biggest one-day drop since mid-July. Wells Fargo, with its own large mortgage portfolio, fell more than 4%, as did Citigroup Inc. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. dropped 2.8%. 
 
 The annual cost of buying five-year credit-default swap protection on $10 million of Bank of America debt rose from $155,000 on Monday to $193,000 on Thursday, with the bulk of the rise coming in the past two days, according to data provider Markit. The cost of protecting similar debt from Wells Fargo rose to $129,000 from $95,000 on Monday. 
 
 ""If nothing else, this is creating uncertainty for the banks,"" Nomura Securities bank analyst David Havens wrote in an email. ""Our take is that it could be quite negative for the banks, and the markets are waking up to this very quickly."" 
 
 The latest foreclosure headache is just one in a string for owners of mortgage securities not backed by government agencies. This $1.3 trillion market has yet to fully recover from its implosion starting in 2007. 
 
 Estimates of the size of the foreclosure problem are still forming. Some $154 billion in mortgages could be affected by foreclosure delays, according to an estimate this week by Laurie Goodman, senior managing director at mortgage-bond trader Amherst Securities Group LP in New York. 
 
 Morgan Stanley trading-desk analyst Greg Gore estimated in a conference call on Tuesday that as much as $134 billion of mortgage bonds held by the nation's four biggest banks could ultimately be affected by foreclosure delays. 
 
 For now, many bond investors doubt the damage will be extensive. But wild cards remain. For starters, attorneys general in all 50 states are investigating foreclosures. 
 
 Some investors still feel burned by a 2008 settlement between attorneys general and Bank of America, after the bank bought Countrywide Financial. The bank agreed to modify mortgages, and investors say they are bearing the costs unfairly. They fear foreclosure investigations could result in mortgage modifications that once again hurt investors. 
 
 In an Oct. 7 ruling, a New York state justice dismissed a lawsuit by investors who argued they shouldn't bear any of the cost of the $8.4 billion settlement. 
 
 Mortgage-bond investors will get more information at the end of the month, when they get fresh data on cash flows from the bonds they own. But that data may only partially reflect the impact of recent foreclosure delays.

 Write to Mark Gongloff at mark.gongloff@wsj.com ||||| “I don’t see how it can be cleared up in a short period of time,” said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities. “The moratorium won’t last that long but the problem will last at least four or five years, maybe a decade.” In the short term, he said, “it could easily cost $1.5 billion per quarter.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the foreclosure machinery in many states has ground to a halt. Major institutions like Bank of America, JPMorgan and GMAC Mortgage have halted foreclosures in many states, and have not said when they would resume. As a result, foreclosed homes will remain on the bank’s books while racking up thousands of dollars a month in extra costs. 
 
 Until Thursday, Wall Street regarded the foreclosure issue as a risk to the banks’ reputations, rather than their bottom lines. Indeed, some analysts insisted it was unlikely that wide-scale abuses would be found.

 “It’s inexcusable that the banks didn’t staff up to meet the surge in foreclosures,” said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. “On the other hand, we need to look at whether they are filing foreclosures on a massive basis against people who are not delinquent. So far, I haven’t seen any evidence that they are.” 
 
 Inside the investment houses, several traders said nerves were frazzled further by worries that banks could face much bigger mortgage related losses, not from foreclosures, but because of questions about how the money was lent in the first place. If it turns out that mortgages were bundled together and sold improperly, more holders could sue the banks and force them to buy back tens of billions in mortgage-backed securities. 
 
 An alarming report on Bank of America, compiled by Branch Hill Capital, a San Francisco hedge fund, circulated widely on Wall Street on Thursday. Branch Hill suggested that the bank, the nation’s largest, could be facing more than $70 billion in losses from mortgage securities that it may have to repurchase from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as private investors.

 “We think this is a very important issue, and the liability will be substantial,” said Manal Mehta, a partner at Branch Hill. “There has been pervasive bad behavior throughout the system.” The fund is betting that Bank of America shares could decline because of the potential liability. 
 
 Bank of America declined to comment Thursday. But the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said last month at an investor conference that adequate reserves had been taken to protect against any losses that could materialize if it was forced to repurchase mortgage securities. “This will be manageable over time, but it has cost us a lot of money so I’m not making light of it,” he said. “We’ll continue to manage it.”

 On Wednesday, JPMorgan said it had added $1 billion to its reserves to cover faulty home loans that it was obligated to repurchase from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and private insurers. It has set aside a total of $3 billion for potential repurchases. 
 
 Even if the larger losses envisioned by Mr. Mehta do not materialize, the foreclosure issue remains a worry. In a report, Paul Miller, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, forecast that the controversy would cost the banking industry $6 billion to $10 billion. He estimated that each month’s delay cost the banks $1,000 per home loan, so if there was a three-month delay on the roughly two million homes currently in foreclosure, that translated into a $6 billion hit. 
 
 In addition to the losses directly caused by the delay, Mr. Miller foresees additional charges totaling $3 billion to $4 billion to cover lawsuits stemming from faulty foreclosure procedures. 
 
 For now, bank executives are not making any predictions how long the foreclosure halt will last. 
 
 “If you’re talking about three or four weeks it will be a blip in the housing market,” said Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, in a conference call on Wednesday. “If it went on for a long period of time, it will have a lot of consequences, most of which will be adverse on everybody.”","– Investors sent bank stocks plunging yesterday, as they finally started to worry about the mortgage robo-signing scandal. Up until now, investors have mostly assumed the crisis would blow over. But on Wednesday, 50 states announced investigations into mortgage servicing practices, and yesterday a San Francisco hedge fund circulated a report predicting that the crisis would wind up costing Bank of America a whopping $70 billion, the New York Times reports. As a result, Bank of America fell 5.2%, its biggest drop since mid-July, Wells Fargo fell 4% and JP Morgan fell 2.8%, despite a relatively flat stock market, according to the Wall Street Journal. “I don’t see how it can be cleared up in a short period of time,” said one analyst. “The moratorium won’t last that long, but the problem will last four or five years, maybe a decade.”","<pad> Bank repossessions rose to their highest level in September, exceeding 100,000 in a month for the first time.</s>",0.07246376574144095,0.0126582257322548,0.07246376574144095
148,"Scientists have added to the complex and controversial tales of origin surrounding the Turin Shroud, by revealing the myriad locations of the DNA and pollen that are present on the cloth. 
 
 The length of linen is highly contentious. Some Christians believe the fabric – which is kept in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin - is the burial shroud of Jesus of Nazereth, dating back over 2,000 years. 
 
 However,previous scientific studies have suggested that the cloth, which appears to be imprinted with the image of a man, may in fact be from the 13th or 14th century - centuries after Jesus is believed to have died. 
 
 Now, a new study by Italian researchers published in the prestigious science journal Nature gives a further insight into the potential origins of the cloth. 
 
 To make their findings for the paper entitled 'Uncovering the sources of DNA found on the Turin Shroud', the team behind the study sequenced the DNA of pollen and other dust from the cloth. 
 
 By doing so, they were able to pinpoint the biogeographic origin of the people who came into contact with the shroud. 
 
 The authors found traces on the parchment from people and pollen from around the world, including Europe, south Asia, eastern Africa and the Middle East. 
 
 Researchers said that the findings could indicate that that the shroud made its ""historic [...] presumed journey"" from the Near East and was taken around the world before being kept in Italy; or that it has its origins in medieval Europe where and was contaminated by those who travelled to it. 
 
 In a further twist, the study indicated that it may have been manufactured in India. ||||| Collection of TS Samples for DNA analyses 
 
 The samples used in this study for DNA investigations are sub-sets of the dust particles vacuumed from the back of the Turin Shroud (TS), which were kindly provided in 2010 by Giulio Fanti (Dept. of Industrial Engineering, University of Padua, Italy), who in turn received them personally from Giovanni Riggi di Numana in 200612,18 (see also Supplementary Document S1). In particular, four samples were originally collected on filters in 1978 from four distinct areas of the back of TS, corresponding to the hands (filter E), face (filter F), feet (filter G) and glutei (filter H) of the TS male image12. An additional sample was collected in 1988, deriving specifically from the corner area (filter I) of TS, which was used for radiocarbon dating8,12 (for details, see Supplementary Figure S2, panels A–C). 
 
 The dust samples collected on these filters were immobilized on adhesive tapes as previously described6,13 and consisted of a variety of particles. In fact, optical microscope observations of filters E-I had previously revealed the presence of pollen grains, cell debris and other minuscule organic specimens, such as plant-derived fibers and blood-like clots6,7,13. 
 
 The five pieces of adhesive tape containing TS dust particles collected on filters E, F, G, H and I were supplied as portions of the original samples (ranging in size from 5 × 10 mm to 10 × 30 mm, see the schematic representation in Supplementary Figure S2, panel D), each attached to a sterile microscope slide. Each piece of adhesive tape was manually cut using a scalpel and tweezers under a stereomicroscope into tiny sub-portions of dimensions on the order of a few square millimeters (~5 × 5 mm each); the pieces were then individually transferred into 1.5-ml sterile microtubes. A total of 2 to 12 square portioned specimens of the pieces of adhesive tape were used for independent genomic DNA extractions; the DNA samples from the individual specimens were kept separate for PCR amplifications. 
 
 PCR amplicons obtained from each of the cpDNA regions were sub-cloned and used individually for DNA sequencing, whereas PCR amplicons obtained from each of the mtDNA regions were pooled for 454 sequencing reactions. In particular, the DNA amplicons from each of the 2, 4 or 6 specimens associated with internal filters E, F, G and H were pooled together into single samples, whereas the DNA amplicons from external filter I were divided into two samples of 6 specimens each (named I and I R and taken as independent biological replications; Supplementary Figure S2). This pooling strategy was imposed by the different sizes of the pieces of adhesive tape to be analyzed for each of the five TS filters and by the fact that dust particles were demonstrated to be much more abundant on the tape representing the external filter than on those for the internal filters6,13. 
 
 All manipulation steps were performed aseptically under laminar flow hood conditions using autoclaved disposables and buffers that were filter-sterilized. In particular, we used sterile materials and all standard procedures with internal negative controls to avoid, or eventually discover, contaminations from the operators and the environment. The entire mitochondrial genomes of the three operators who came in contact with the Shroud samples were completely sequenced and all mtDNA sequences that we obtained from the TS samples and could be theoretically attributed to operator contamination (Supplementary Table S3) were excluded from our final results. As for possible environmental contaminations, none of the large varieties of plant sources detected in the Shroud (Supplementary Table S1) through the analysis of nuclear ITS, chloroplast genes or cpDNA sequences are grown or studied in our facilities. 
 
 Genomic DNA extraction 
 
 Specimens from the pieces of adhesive tape with the TS dust particles were used individually for genomic DNA extraction to avoid any loss of TS material and to perform replicate experiments for each TS filter. 
 
 All genomic DNA extractions were performed with the QIAamp®DNA Investigator commercial kit (Qiagen) by applying the protocol originally developed for laser-microdissected specimens, with some modifications. All manipulation steps were performed under laminar flow hood conditions using DNA- and DNase-free, disposable autoclaved materials and filter-sterilized buffers. Immediately after collection, sub-samples were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube containing a pre-warmed mixture composed of 40 μl of ATL buffer and 20 μl proteinase K. Each sample was then mixed by pulse-vortexing and incubated at 56 °C for 16 hours under constant agitation. After this step, 100 μl of the AL buffer, containing 2 μg of carrier RNA, was added, and the solution was mixed by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec. Then, 100 μl absolute ethanol was added, and the solution was mixed thoroughly by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The next steps, which consisted of DNA immobilization to a silica membrane and wash steps to clean the isolated DNA from salts and impurities, were conducted by following the manufacturer’s suggestions. Elution of the DNA immobilized by the silica membrane was performed in two steps by using 15 μl ATE buffer at each elution step and by extending the incubation step to 10 min at room temperature. 
 
 To identify human genetic lineages and plant taxonomic entities, specific plant DNA and human mitochondrial DNA regions were designated for PCR amplification and sequencing. 
 
 PCR amplification and sequencing of plant and human DNA sequences 
 
 PCR amplifications of plant DNA sequences were performed with primer combinations designed using nuclear (rDNA intergenic transcribed spacers, ITS) and chloroplast targets (cpDNA barcodes RuBisCO or rbcL, trnH-psbA, and trnL-intron) (Supplementary Table S4), following already available protocols19,20. Briefly, the reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl that included 2 μl of 10X reaction buffer, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 0.3 mM dNTPs, 0.25 U of Platinum® Pfx DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies), 0.3 μM of primer mix and 2.5 μl of eluted DNA solution. The reactions were performed in a 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) using a temperature profile that consisted of an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 50 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 30 sec at 55 °C, 1 min at 68 °C and a final step of 10 min at 68 °C. 
 
 The same conditions were adopted for PCR amplifications of human sequences corresponding to three distinct mtDNA loci (MT-DLOOP with the hypervariable segments MT-HV1 and MT-HV2, MT-CO1, and MT-ND5) using specific primer pairs (Supplementary Table S4). 
 
 The amplicons were sub-cloned by ligation into the TOPO-blunt cloning vector (Life Technologies) and transformed into chemically competent one-shot TOP10 bacterial cells (Life Technologies). Clones were plated on LB plates (1.5% agar, 50 μg/mL ampicillin, 40 μg/ml X-Gal), and transformed colonies were selected by Colony-PCR. Amplification reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl including 2 μl of 10X reaction buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 300 μM dNTPs, 1.5 U of BIOTaq DNA polymerase (BIOLINE), 0.2 μM of M13For (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′) and M13Rev (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) primers. Positive colonies were sequenced using an ABI3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). 
 
 Both nuclear ITS sequences and DNA barcodes were used to identify plant and fungal species21,22, querying the Barcode of Life Data BOLD Systems v. 3 (http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/IDS_OpenIdEngine). Sequence similarity searches in nucleotide collections (nt) and with non-redundant protein sequences (nr) were also performed with blastn/x programs of the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST v. 2.2.30+ (http://blast.st-va.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using default parameters. All plant cpDNA and ITS sequences deriving from PCR amplicons were verified through replicated sequencing of both strands and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers JQ007354-JQ007431 and JQ082521-JQ082524. The human mtDNA sequences, as clusters deriving from the assembly of reads generated by 454 sequencing, were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KP126143-KP126230. 
 
 For each plant sequence, we collected information regarding: i) the TS location source; ii) the GenBank accession number of the most similar sequence; iii) the Linnaean name of the species, including the botanical family and its common name; iv) the name and length of the target DNA sequence; v) the center of origin and geographical distribution of the species, along with information on plant type and/or common use (for details, see Supplementary Table S1). From an experimental point of view, it should be noted that some species were identified in biological replicates by using different specimens of the same filter as well as different filters but were also assessed by technical replicates according to amplicons from different genetic targets. In addition, other species were identified by performing independent experiments, meaning that the PCR analyses were conducted at different times using DNA samples isolated at different times from the same filters/dust samples. All these cases are pivotal experimental validations and demonstrate the robust assignments of plant species (or genus). 
 
 PCR amplification of human mtDNA and preparation of libraries for pyrosequencing 
 
 Amplifications of target mtDNA sequences prior to pyrosequencing were performed as described in the previous paragraph using specific primer sets (Supplementary Table S4). It is worth mentioning that the successful amplification of human mtDNA fragments ranging in size from 419 to 576 bp (as well as plant nuclear and chloroplast DNAs from 229 to 622 bp) such as the ones that we amplified, would be mostly possible from undamaged or slightly damaged DNA templates, which is unexpected when dealing with very ancient DNA specimens. However, the size of ancient DNA fragments, in addition to age, is influenced by many additional factors such as environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture and pH) and mode of preservation (e.g., museum specimens vs. freshly excavated remains). In brief, DNA degradation becomes more effective only over long intervals, but is de facto unpredictable over shorter time spans such as those postulated for the DNA traces on the TS and when considering the numerous copies of extra-nuclear DNA molecules23,24,25,26. 
 
 PCR products originating from the amplification of multiple samples were pooled (Supplementary Table S4) and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) by following the recommendations of the supplier. Next, the amplicons of the three different mtDNA target regions were pooled together, as reported in Supplementary Table S5, and purified with the Agencourt AMPure XP procedure (Beckman Coulter) by following the recommendations of the supplier. Quantification of the pooled amplicons was performed with a Nanodrop fluorometer ND 3300 (Thermo Scientific). 
 
 Libraries were prepared starting from 100 ng of purified PCR products using Rapid Library Preparation Method (Series GS FLX+; Roche 454 sequencing), starting from step 3.2: Fragment End Repair (thus avoiding the step 3.1, DNA Fragmentation by Nebulization). Single libraries were tagged with univocal MIDs (Supplementary Table S6). Emulsion PCR and 454 sequencing were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions on the Roche 454 FLX Titanium platform. Library sequencing was carried out using a Roche 454 GS Junior System. 
 
 Analysis of sequence reads, variant calling and cluster assembly 
 
 Sequence reads were de-multiplexed based on their MID sequence with the Roche 454 software SFFfile. The number of sequenced and aligned reads referring to the single libraries are reported in Supplementary Table S7. 
 
 Mapping of the sequence reads to the H. sapiens mitochondrial genome (gb|NC_012920.1) was performed with the software CLC Genomics Workbench version 5.05 with defaults parameters. Mapping of the sequence reads originating from each library was used to estimate the average coverage for each target region. Background noise in the sequences was filtered with a program developed ad hoc that analyzes the composition in words (k-mer) of the produced sequences and masks the words having a frequency lower than the value set as the cutoff. For this step, the length of the k-mers was set to 7, and the minimum frequency parameter was set to 5. After the masking of rare variants, the sequences were clustered with the software CD HIT v.4.5.427 by setting a threshold of percent identity equal to 99%. The average coverage of the mtDNA target regions for each single pool and target region is summarized in Supplementary Table S7. 
 
 Sequence clusters with a length greater than 200 bp were aligned to the H. sapiens mitochondrial genome (gb|NC_012920.1) using the program “bwa”28 with default parameters. In this step, each pool of sequences was independently aligned against the reference sequence17. The alignment files were saved as standard SAM files. Variant calling was performed on alignments of sequences representative of each cluster with the software PASS29. For each cluster, the haplotype was defined as the collection of substitutions (either transversions or transitions) that emerged in the variant calling process. Insertions and deletions were not taken into account. 
 
 A pre-filtering step for estimation of the mtDNA haplogroups represented in our cluster sequences was performed with the software HaploGrep30, which allows the automatic assignment of haplogroups according to Phylotree31. Preliminary assignments of haplogroups to sequence clusters displaying the highest sequence coverage were manually verified. The frequency of each haplogroup was estimated by the number of sequences contained in each cluster assigned to that specific haplogroup. The distribution of haplogroups in the different samples was estimated as above, but by counting the sequences according to the library information. The assembled human mtDNA sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KM655881-KM655934 (for details, see Supplementary Table S8). ||||| Editor's Note: This story was updated at 1:55 p.m. E.T. 
 
 Is it a medieval fake or a relic of Jesus Christ? A new analysis of DNA from the Shroud of Turin reveals that people from all over the world have touched the venerated garment. 
 
 ""Individuals from different ethnic groups and geographical locations came into contact with the Shroud [of Turin] either in Europe (France and Turin) or directly in their own lands of origin (Europe, northeast Africa, Caucasus, Anatolia, Middle East and India),"" study lead author Gianni Barcaccia, a geneticist at the University of Padua in Italy and lead author of the new study describing the DNA analysis, said in an email. ""We cannot say anything more on its origin."" 
 
 The new findings don't rule out either the notion that the long strip of linen is a medieval forgery or that it's the true burial shroud of Jesus Christ, the researchers said. 
 
 Long-standing debate 
 
 On its face, the Shroud of Turin is an unassuming piece of twill cloth that bears traces of blood and a darkened imprint of a man's body. Though the Catholic Church has never taken an official stance on the object's authenticity, tens of thousands flock to Turin, Italy, every year to get a glimpse of the object, believing that it wrapped the bruised and bleeding body of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. [Religious Mysteries: 8 Alleged Relics of Jesus] 
 
 According to legend, the shroud was secretly carried from Judea in A.D. 30 or 33, and was housed in Edessa, Turkey, and Constantinople (the name for Istanbul before the Ottomans took over) for centuries. After crusaders sacked Constantinople in A.D. 1204, the cloth was smuggled to safety in Athens, Greece, where it stayed until A.D. 1225. 
 
 However, the Catholic Church only officially recorded its existence in A.D. 1353, when it showed up in a tiny church in Lirey, France. Centuries later, in the 1980s, radiocarbon dating, which measures the rate at which different isotopes of the carbon atoms decay, suggested the shroud was made between A.D. 1260 and A.D. 1390, lending credence to the notion that it was an elaborate fake created in the Middle Ages. (Isotopes are forms of an element with a different number of neutrons.) 
 
 But critics argued that the researchers used patched-up portions of the cloth to date the samples, which could have been much younger than the rest of the garment. 
 
 What's more, the Gospel of Matthew notes that ""the earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open"" after Jesus was crucified. So geologists have argued that an earthquake at Jesus' death could have released a burst of neutrons. The neutron burst not only would have thrown off the radiocarbon dating but also would have led to the darkened imprint on the shroud. 
 
 Global traveler? 
 
 In the current study, Barcaccia and his colleagues analyzed dust that they vacuumed from the shroud that contained traces of both plant and human DNA. 
 
 The plant DNA came from all over the world, the researchers reported Oct. 5 in the journal Scientific Reports. European spruce trees; Mediterranean clovers, ryegrasses and plantains; North American black locust trees; and rare East Asian pear and plum trees all left their mark on the cloth. 
 
 The team also sequenced the human mitochondrial DNA (DNA passed from mother to child) found in dust from the shroud. The genetic lineage, or haplotype, of the DNA snippets suggested that people ranging from North African Berbers to East Africans to inhabitants of China touched the garment. 
 
 Still, the strongest genetic signals seemed to come from areas in and around the Middle East and the Caucasus — not far from where Jesus was buried, and consistent with the early folklore surrounding the object. [The 10 Most Controversial Miracles] 
 
 ""One of the most abundant human mitochondrial haplotypes, among those discovered on the shroud, is still very rare in western Europe, and it is typical of the Druze community, an ethnic group that has some origin in Egypt and that lives mainly in restricted areas between Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine,"" Barcaccia told Live Science in an email. 
 
 The oldest DNA snippets (which tend to be shorter because DNA breaks down over time) are found in many places on the shroud, and come from genetic lineages typically found only in India, Barcaccia said. That finding suggests that the shroud was manufactured in India before somehow making its way to Europe, as Indians had little contact with Europeans at the time of its origin. 
 
 ""In my opinion, it is hard to believe that in the past centuries, in a historical interval spanning the medieval period, different subjects — such as priests, monks or nuns, as well [as] devotees and other subjects of Indian ancestry — have had the possibility to come in contact with the shroud in France and/or Turin,"" Barcaccia said. 
 
 Unsettled question 
 
 But the new results don't settle questions about the shroud's authenticity, said Hugh Farey, editor of the British Society of the Turin Shroud newsletter. [Who Was Jesus, the Man?] 
 
 As far as the plant DNA goes, ""they've done a good job, and they've identified a number of species that mean, broadly speaking, nothing at all,"" Farey told Live Science. 
 
 The new study suffers from the same issues that made past studies of pollen on the shroud unreliable, said Renée Enevold, a geoscientist at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark who has analyzed ancient pollen in the past. 
 
 ""The plant DNA could be from many sources, and there is no way of finding the right source,"" Enevold told Live Science in an email. ""Also, the sub-genus level of taxon that has been reached is not near enough to the species level that is needed to determine the area of origin for each plant."" 
 
 The researchers also mistakenly relied on an interpretative method that is used to analyze thousands of grains of pollen in a lake, she said. In that environment, the conditions that led to the deposition of pollen — rain and wind, for instance — are known. In contrast, there are so many unknowns when it comes to describing how dust settled onto the shroud. 
 
 ""It is very bold and completely wrong to use the same interpretational approach on the presence of DNA — or just a few pollen grains, for that matter — on a shroud that has been man-handled for decades,"" Enevold said. 
 
 Given that the cloth was publicly displayed for centuries, it's not surprising that so many people touched it, Farey added. ""Apart from ruling out the United States of America as the source for the shroud, it leaves just about everything else open,"" Farey said. 
 
 As for the possible Indian manufacture, it's just as likely that Indian DNA got onto the object during its 20th-century testing, he said. To truly determine where the cloth was manufactured, the researchers would need to analyze the DNA from the flax seeds used to make the linen shroud, which was not done, he added. 
 
 Still, Farey said he's about 40 percent convinced the shroud is authentic and about 60 percent inclined to believe it is a forgery. 
 
 ""There is a pretty substantial amount of evidence on both sides,"" Farey said. ""So the proper thing to do is to maintain an open mind at the moment."" 
 
 However, using DNA analysis and more sophisticated scientific techniques could ultimately settle the question, Farey said. For instance, geologists can now determine the origin of rock with incredible precision, by analyzing its ratio of isotopes of certain elements. If researchers can one day figure out how to test the isotopes in the limestone dust found on the shroud, they could say with greater certainty whether the shroud was ever in Jerusalem, he said.

An Italian team analyzed DNA from the relic some believe is the burial cloth of Jesus but failed to find conclusive proof of its origins, the Independent reports. The testing revealed traces of people and pollen from many parts of the world, meaning it that could be a medieval forgery—or that its journey to Europe could indeed have begun in Jerusalem around 30 or 33AD.

 After 1.7 million miles we’ve learned a lot — not just about our system but how humans drive, too. 
 
 Chris Urmson Blocked Unblock Follow Following May 11, 2015 Unlisted 
 
 About 33,000 people die on America’s roads every year. That’s why so much of the enthusiasm for self-driving cars has focused on their potential to reduce accident rates. As we continue to work toward our vision of fully self-driving vehicles that can take anyone from point A to point B at the push of a button, we’re thinking a lot about how to measure our progress and our impact on road safety. 
 
 One of the most important things we need to understand in order to judge our cars’ safety performance is “baseline” accident activity on typical suburban streets. Quite simply, because many incidents never make it into official statistics, we need to find out how often we can expect to get hit by other drivers. Even when our software and sensors can detect a sticky situation and take action earlier and faster than an alert human driver, sometimes we won’t be able to overcome the realities of speed and distance; sometimes we’ll get hit just waiting for a light to change. And that’s important context for communities with self-driving cars on their streets; although we wish we could avoid all accidents, some will be unavoidable.

 The most common accidents our cars are likely to experience in typical day to day street driving — light damage, no injuries — aren’t well understood because they’re not reported to police. Yet according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data, these incidents account for 55% of all crashes. It’s hard to know what’s really going on out on the streets unless you’re doing miles and miles of driving every day. And that’s exactly what we’ve been doing with our fleet of 20+ self-driving vehicles and team of safety drivers, who’ve driven 1.7 million miles (manually and autonomously combined). The cars have self-driven nearly a million of those miles, and we’re now averaging around 10,000 self-driven miles a week (a bit less than a typical American driver logs in a year), mostly on city streets. 
 
 In the spirit of helping all of us be safer drivers, we wanted to share a few patterns we’ve seen. A lot of this won’t be a surprise, especially if you already know that driver error causes 94% of crashes. 
 
 If you spend enough time on the road, accidents will happen whether you’re in a car or a self-driving car. Over the 6 years since we started the project, we’ve been involved in 11 minor accidents (light damage, no injuries) during those 1.7 million miles of autonomous and manual driving with our safety drivers behind the wheel, and not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident. 
 
 Rear-end crashes are the most frequent accidents in America, and often there’s little the driver in front can do to avoid getting hit; we’ve been hit from behind seven times, mainly at traffic lights but also on the freeway. We’ve also been side-swiped a couple of times and hit by a car rolling through a stop sign. And as you might expect, we see more accidents per mile driven on city streets than on freeways; we were hit 8 times in many fewer miles of city driving. All the crazy experiences we’ve had on the road have been really valuable for our project. We have a detailed review process and try to learn something from each incident, even if it hasn’t been our fault. 
 
 Not only are we developing a good understanding of minor accident rates on suburban streets, we’ve also identified patterns of driver behavior (lane-drifting, red-light running) that are leading indicators of significant collisions. Those behaviors don’t ever show up in official statistics, but they create dangerous situations for everyone around them. 
 
 Lots of people aren’t paying attention to the road. In any given daylight moment in America, there are 660,000 people behind the wheel who are checking their devices instead of watching the road. Our safety drivers routinely see people weaving in and out of their lanes; we’ve spotted people reading books, and even one playing a trumpet. A self-driving car has people beat on this dimension of road safety. With 360 degree visibility and 100% attention out in all directions at all times; our newest sensors can keep track of other vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians out to a distance of nearly two football fields. 
 
 Intersections can be scary places. Over the last several years, 21% of the fatalities and about 50% of the serious injuries on U.S. roads have involved intersections. And the injuries are usually to pedestrians and other drivers, not the driver running the red light. This is why we’ve programmed our cars to pause briefly after a light turns green before proceeding into the intersection — that’s often when someone will barrel impatiently or distractedly through the intersection. 
 
 In this case, a cyclist (the light blue box) got a late start across the intersection and narrowly avoided getting hit by a car making a left turn (the purple box entering the intersection) who didn’t see him and had started to move when the light turned green. Our car predicted the cyclist’s behavior (the red path) and did not start moving until the cyclist was safely across the intersection. 
 
 Turns can be trouble. We see people turning onto, and then driving on, the wrong side of the road a lot — particularly at night, it’s common for people to overshoot or undershoot the median. 
 
 In this image you can see not one, but two cars (the two purple boxes on the left of the green path are the cars you can see in the photo) coming toward us on the wrong side of the median; this happened at night on one of Mountain View’s busiest boulevards. 
 
 Other times, drivers do very silly things when they realize they’re about to miss their turn. 
 
 A car (the purple box touching the green rectangles with an exclamation mark over it) decided to make a right turn from the lane to our left, cutting sharply across our path. The green rectangles, which we call a “fence,” indicate our car is going to slow down to avoid the car making this crazy turn. 
 
 And other times, cars seem to behave as if we’re not there. In the image below, a car in the leftmost turn lane (the purple box with a red fence through it) took the turn wide and cut off our car. In this case, the red fence indicates our car is stopping and avoiding the other vehicle. 
 
 These experiences (and countless others) have only reinforced for us the challenges we all face on our roads today. We’ll continue to drive thousands of miles so we can all better understand the all too common incidents that cause many of us to dislike day to day driving — and we’ll continue to work hard on developing a self-driving car that can shoulder this burden for us.

 Follow Backchannel: Twitter | Facebook ||||| Eleven driverless vehicles have been involved in minor accidents on California roads over the past six years during testing, Google said Monday, stressing that none of its cars were at fault in any of the incidents. 
 
 The company made the admission after a reported from the Associated Press said two Google driverless cars, while controlled by computers, were involved in accidents since last fall when the state gave the company official permission to start testing the technology on public roads. Nobody was hurt in any of the crashes, Google said. 
 
 But in the wake of the accidents, the police reports were not made public in accordance with California law. Google did not release the reports either — a practice could hurt the very future of driverless cars that several technology companies are trying to build. 
 
 Proponents of self-driving cars argue that computer-driven vehicles can help improve automotive safety by reacting more quickly to oncoming dangers and keeping a better eye on the environment, reducing the risk of driver error. But the public lacks objective data about whether that’s true in practice or even potentially true. 
 
 Earning drivers’ trust is going to be one of the biggest challenges for driverless car manufacturers. Giving up the steering wheel to a computer just won’t come naturally to many people. Nor will the prospect of having to share the road with machines that can make their own decisions. 
 
 ”Safety is our highest priority,” said Google in a statement. “Since the start of our program six years ago, we’ve driven nearly a million miles autonomously, on both freeways and city streets, and the self-driving car hasn’t caused a single accident.” 
 
 Add it all up and the message seems pretty clear: The autopilot was not the problem. 
 
 But what would really bolster people’s confidence is if the companies could prove that the autopilot performed well at preventing or avoiding a crash — not merely that it wasn’t the cause of a crash. 
 
 In two of the crashes, according to the AP, the driverless car features were engaged and no human was behind the wheel. Understanding exactly how the self-driving cars behaved under these conditions — and in similar situations to come — will be the key to showing whether driverless cars really are better or safer than humans behind the wheel. 
 
 Imagine a world in which driverless cars are the only types of car on the road. In this hypothetical universe, driverless cars are completely safe. Each vehicle behaves predictably according to its programming, so the interactions between those cars become predictable events as well. In this universe, the inattentiveness, speeding, road rage and the half-dozen other reasons accidents happen today would have been eradicated. 
 
 The world we inhabit today is far messier. For the foreseeable future, self-driving cars will have to respond to all the crazy things human drivers do, such as cutting other people off, texting behind the wheel, or driving drunk. 
 
 If the police reports show there was nothing the autopilot could have done to prevent a crash, that’s a clear point in favor of driverless car manufacturers — especially if the reports also suggest that a human driver would have fared no better. 
 
 But suppose the crashes involved a head-on collision with an 18-wheeler whose lights were flashing and horn was blasting, and the driverless car missed all the signs. That would be a big problem. 
 
 The fact that we don’t really know, and that the state of California won’t release the reports, could become a setback for the adoption of driverless cars. We are left with voluntary disclosures by individual manufacturers to fill the gap. On Monday, Google published a post explaining that its cars have been in 11 “minor” accidents, 7 of which occurred when another driver rear-ended them. The blog post also highlights cases where the autopilot successfully avoided crash risks even as other drivers were behaving dangerously in the situation. But the full police reports were not released. 
 
 This type of crash and near-crash information, particularly on a large scale, could help consumers make informed decisions about whether to get a self-driving car if and when they finally make it to market. ||||| Internet search company Google Inc's self-driving cars have been involved in 11 accidents, but have not been the cause of any, over the last six years since the project began, the program's director said on Monday. 
 
 A team of drivers that is testing the fleet of more than 20 vehicles have driven 1.7 million miles so far. 
 
 ""...Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,"" Chris Urmson said in a post on technology news website Backchannel's blog Medium. (bit.ly/1GZciuW) No one was injured in the accidents, Urmson added. 
 
 ""If you spend enough time on the road, accidents will happen whether you're in a car or a self-driving car.""

 (Reporting by Kanika Sikka in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Wills) ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — The self-driving cars that Google Inc. has been testing on California's roads and highways were involved in 11 minor accidents over the past six years, according to the tech giant.

 The company released the number Monday after The Associated Press reported that Google had notified California of three collisions involving its self-driving cars since September, when reporting all accidents became a legal requirement as part of the permits for the tests on public roads. 
 
 The director of Google's self-driving car project wrote in a web post that all 11 accidents were minor — ""light damage, no injuries"" — and happened over 1.7 million miles of testing, including nearly 1 million miles in self-driving mode. 
 
 ""Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,"" wrote Google's Chris Urmson. 
 
 It was not possible to independently verify Google's assertions about the fault and nature of the collisions. The company would not release accident documentation, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles said it could not discuss details, citing confidentiality. The agency has licensed just 48 of these test cars. 
 
 An accident caused by a self-driving car is a fear of the people developing them, whether at Google or one of the traditional automakers. That's not just because if the accident is particularly horrific, public and political acceptance of the technology would suffer badly. It's also because the reaction to the first car-caused accident will set a precedent in terms of financial liability. 
 
 ""Assuming that you are not dead, you are in a much better positon than if you had been hit by an ordinary, human-driven vehicle,"" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who has studied issues about the cars. 
 
 That's because the company behind the car will have deep pockets. California law makes it hard for any but major companies or very wealthy individual to test the cars. Each one requires $5 million worth of insurance. 
 
 Given the potential for bad publicity, the company will have strong incentive to settle any lawsuit quickly and generously, Smith said. 
 
 Three other states have passed laws welcoming tests of self-driving cars onto their roads. Regulators in Nevada, Michigan and Florida told The Associated Press that they weren't aware of any accidents. 
 
 If a car in self-driving mode hits a pedestrian, the case becomes a matter of product liability. 
 
 California law has a definition of a design defect that would favor a person who is hit, said Robert W. Peterson, insurance law expert and law professor at Santa Clara University. 
 
 If the car ""fails to behave in a way which a reasonable consumer would expect it to behave, that is a defect,"" Peterson said. The cars have a clear picture of their surroundings more than a football field away. If a person reasonably expects that one of the cars would stop rather than strike, that could create liability. 
 
 Because the cars are required to record and store the last 30 seconds of a data before any accident, reconstructing what happened should be easier, at least.

150,"Donald Trump, the celebrity mogul whose brash and un­or­tho­dox presidential bid was counted out time and again, became the de facto Republican nominee Tuesday night after a runaway victory in Indiana’s primary forced his two GOP rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, to quit the race. 
 
 Trump overcame a spirited last stand by Cruz — and a patchwork movement of Republicans working desperately to derail him in fear that his polarizing politics could doom the party — to gallop to the nomination. Indiana’s results positioned him to easily accumulate the 1,237 delegates required to avert a contested convention. 
 
 Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the “presumptive nominee” and urged all Republicans to unite behind him. 
 
 Cruz dropped out Tuesday night in the aftermath of the drubbing, saying he saw no path forward to the nomination. Kasich, who won only his home state of Ohio, is set to announce his departure from the race later Wednesday in Columbus.

 On the Democratic side, Indiana proved a surprising aberration as Bernie Sanders scored an upset victory over Hillary Clinton, giving the Vermont senator a needed psychological boost and a fresh rationale to soldier on against increasingly difficult odds. 
 
 But Sanders’s success did not change the overall trajectory of the Democratic race, which remains strongly in the former secretary of state’s favor. Clinton holds what her campaign and many analysts argue is an irreversible lead in total delegates. Although she has not clinched the nomination, she has shifted her focus to a likely general election campaign against Trump. 
 
 In Indiana, a large manufacturing state battered by shifts in the global economy, Trump and Sanders triumphed on the power of their populist pitches against free trade as well as by channeling the passions of voters who are distrustful of the nation’s political and economic systems. 
 
 As Trump claimed the mantle of GOP standard-bearer on Tuesday night, he was uncharacteristically measured. He remarked on his unlikely journey — “It’s been some unbelievable day and evening and year . . . a beautiful thing to behold” — and promised Republicans that he would not let them down. “We’re going to win big league, believe me,” he said at Trump Tower in New York. “We’re going after Hillary Clinton. She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president.” 
 
 Clinton, who campaigned Tuesday in the general election battleground of Ohio, now has her focus squarely on Trump. In a statement acknowledging Trump’s status as presumptive nominee, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said, “Throughout this campaign, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he’s too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world. With so much at stake, Donald Trump is simply too big of a risk.” 
 
 The Hoosier State’s results capped an especially explosive day in the Republican race. In a last gasp on Tuesday morning, Cruz unloaded a litany of personal charges against Trump — a striking shift in tone that conveyed both the Texas senator’s frustrations with his fading fortunes and his freedom to finally speak his mind about the rival he once praised lavishly.

 But as Trump savored what his family members described as a shocking evening, he strived to be magnanimous in his remarks and singled out Cruz for praise. “Ted Cruz — I don’t know if he likes me or he doesn’t like me, but he is one hell of a competitor,” Trump said. “He is a tough, smart guy. And he has got an amazing future.” 
 
 Moments earlier, Cruz gave an emotional concession speech in Indianapolis. Flanked by his family and running mate Carly Fiorina, he said: “We left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we’ve got. But the voters chose another path. And so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.” 
 
 In a GOP race that began with 17 candidates — including four sitting governors, four sitting senators and an astoundingly well-funded scion of the Bush political dynasty — it was Trump who won over the party’s most restive and confrontational voters. He looks to California, which awards 172 delegates on June 7, the final day of primary voting, to make his nomination officially secure. 
 
 Trump faces an immediate challenge to unify the fractured GOP. There are already clear fissures, with Republicans Mark Salter, a former top adviser to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), and Ben Howe, an editor of RedState, tweeting “I’m with her” — meaning they support Clinton. 
 
 Kasich held no public appearance on Tuesday night and scrapped plans to hold a news conference Wednesday morning at Washington Dulles International Airport. He will read a statement announcing the end of his campaign at 5 p.m. Wednesday, according to senior advisers. 
 
 Kasich entered the race with an impressive résumé: 18 years in the House, where he built a reputation as a budget cutter; a stint as a Fox News Channel host; and five years as the popular governor of a presidential swing state. He ran as a pragmatic conservative, one had defied his own party and expanded Medicaid, the federal health-care program for the poor, in Ohio. The message never caught on, and Kasich struggled to attract both fundraising and attention. 
 
 [The question of the moment: What will Trump be like as GOP nominee?] 
 
 For Cruz, the last days of the race in Indiana were a painful demonstration that his time had run out. After Trump’s landslide April victories in six consecutive Northeast and Mid-Atlantic primaries, Cruz saw Indiana as an essential lifeline. His political operation went into overdrive, and he barnstormed Indiana as hard as any state since the kickoff Iowa caucuses. His allied super PACs spent millions of dollars advertising in the state. 
 
 Cruz’s moves over the past week signaled desperation. He struck a nonaggression pact with Kasich, who effectively pulled out of Indiana to give Cruz a one-on-one shot against Trump in exchange for Cruz ceding coming primaries in Oregon and New Mexico. 
 
 Cruz also named Fiorina as a running mate, and the two of them hurled fiery insults at Trump on the stump. Cruz escalated his rhetoric at a news conference Tuesday, labeling Trump “utterly amoral,” a “serial philanderer” and a “braggadocious, arrogant buffoon,” among other slurs. 
 
 None of it worked. Pre-primary polls showed Trump the chief beneficiary of the Cruz-Kasich deal and pulling farther ahead. 
 
 [Cruz unloads on Trump: A ‘narcissist at a level I don’t think this country has ever seen’] 
 
 Trump left nothing to chance. Unlike in some earlier contests, his campaign aired television ads and ran a sizable field operation while the candidate kept up a busy schedule of massive rallies. Trump toured the state with retired Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight. 
 
 Cruz, meanwhile, was beset by bad luck. The Fiorina announcement was overtaken by news that former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) had disparaged Cruz as “Lucifer in the flesh.” Cruz won a hard-sought endorsement from Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, but it drew notice instead for being markedly mealy-mouthed. Pro-Trump hecklers personally confronted Cruz outside one of his events. And Fiorina fell off a campaign stage. 
 
 Cruz’s frustrations boiled over Tuesday. After Trump attacked Cruz by referring to an unsubstantiated National Enquirer story alleging that Cruz’s father, Rafael, was connected to President John F. Kennedy’s assassin, Cruz unleashed his tirade. 
 
 [GOP elites are now resigned to Donald Trump as their nominee] 
 
 Buoying Trump, 6 in 10 Indiana Republican voters — a larger share than in most previous contests — said they wanted the next president to come from outside the political establishment, according to preliminary exit polling reported by ABC News. 
 
 Similarly, nearly half of Indiana’s Republican voters were supportive of deporting undocumented immigrants, while that figure in earlier contests averaged 41 percent, the data showed. And more Republicans said that Cruz had run the most unfair campaign than said so of Trump, according to the exit polling. 
 
 Trump neutralized Cruz’s support from demographic groups — evangelicals, college graduates and voters who describe themselves as very conservative — that in previous primaries backed the Texan heavily, exit polling showed. 
 
 On the Democratic side, Clinton’s earlier victories were so commanding that she could withstand even a string of lopsided losses in May and still secure the nomination. Sanders has pledged to remain in the race until the end, even though his fundraising has slowed considerably and the scale of his political operation has been downsized accordingly. 
 
 But Sanders told reporters Tuesday night that he felt “a great deal of momentum.” 
 
 “I sense some great victories coming,” Sanders said. “And I think while the path is narrow, and I do not deny that for a moment, I think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.”

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on campaign 2016 as voters in Indiana head to the polls for the state primary (all times Eastern): 
 
 10:43 p.m. 
 
 Bernie Sanders netted about a half-dozen more delegates than Hillary Clinton after winning Indiana Tuesday. But in terms of the delegate math, his path to the Democratic nomination hasn't gotten any easier. 
 
 Clinton is now 92 percent of the way to clinching the Democratic nomination. 
 
 With 83 Indiana delegates at stake, Sanders will gain at least 43. Clinton picked up at least 37. Three delegates remain to be allocated, pending final vote tallies. 
 
 That means based on primaries and caucuses to date, Clinton now has 1,682 and Sanders has 1,361. 
 
 Clinton's lead is bigger when including superdelegates, or party officials who can back any candidate. 
 
 She has 2,202, or 181 delegates away from the 2,383 needed to win, keeping her on track to clinch the nomination by early June. Sanders has 1,400. 
 
 If he still hopes to win the nomination, Sanders would need to win more than 84 percent of the remaining delegates and superdelegates. 
 
 ___ 
 
 10:40 p.m. 
 
 Donald Trump has a clear path to the Republican nomination for president, but he still has some work to do to clinch it. 
 
 Mathematically, Trump cannot reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination until June 7, the last day of the primary season. 
 
 He needs just 42 percent of the remaining delegates to get there. His chances are good. 
 
 Trump's last remaining rival, John Kasich, has won just one state, his home state of Ohio. Since then, Kasich has collected a total of nine delegates. 
 
 Kasich is fourth in the race for delegates, behind Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who have suspended their campaigns. 
 
 Trump won at least 51 delegates in Indiana, with six delegates remaining. 
 
 The AP delegate count: 
 
 Trump: 1,047. 
 
 Cruz: 565. 
 
 Kasich: 152.

 Donald Trump has won the state primary, clinching at least 45 delegates, putting him on a solid path to the nomination. 
 
 Cruz's campaign switched from showing televised election results on a big screen to an internal TV feed as the race was called for Trump. Country singer Dierks Bentley's song ""I'll Hold On"" played in the hall as his supporters chatted, ate snacks and drank.

 There are still 12 delegates left to be allocated. 
 
 Trump needs to win just 43 percent of the remaining delegates to capture the nomination by the end of the primaries on June 7. 
 
 He has won a majority of the delegates allocated so far. 
 
 Trump's rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, have been mathematically eliminated from reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination before the convention. Their only hope is to block Trump and force a contested convention in which no one arrives with a majority of the delegates.

 Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have both attacked their parties' nomination processes. They've also gone after their opponents for what they say are unfair tactics. But Indiana voters on both sides don't see much of a fairness gap in the presidential race. 
 
 Only a third of GOP voters say their party's nomination process has been unfair, according to early results from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. 
 
 When it comes to tactics, most Democratic primary voters don't see either Sanders or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as having attacked the other unfairly. 
 
 Republican primary voters were about equally likely to say that each of the top two candidates ran the most unfair campaign. Four in 10 voters say Trump did, while four in 10 say Texas Sen. Ted Cruz did.

 Indiana Democrats voting in the state's primary election say they've been energized by their party's nominating process, while most GOP voters say their party has been divided by the political sparring among their top candidates. 
 
 That's according to early results from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. 
 
 Three-quarters of Indiana Democrats in Tuesday's election say they think the nominating process has energized rather than divided their party. But nearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they think their party has been divided by the nominating process. 
 
 About 7 in 10 Democrats say they'd be excited or at least optimistic about the presidency of either former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
 
 But only about half of Indiana GOP voters are excited or even optimistic about billionaire Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich becoming president. 
 
 Still, most GOP primary voters say they would probably support Trump, Cruz or Kasich in November.

 At a Tuesday night press conference, the Vermont senator touted the momentum of his campaign while acknowledging that it's an uphill battle for him to clinch the nomination. 
 
 ""We feel great about tonight, not only in winning here in Indiana ... but also gaining the momentum we need to take us to the finish line,"" Sanders said. ""I sense some great deal of momentum. 
 
 ""I sense some great victories coming, and I think while the path is narrow — and I do not deny that for a moment — I think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States and, in fact, become the nominee for the Democratic Party,"" he continued. ""And once we secure that position, I have absolute confidence that we are gonna defeat Donald Trump in the general election."" 
 
 The Indiana Democratic primary was too close to call once all the polls closed at 7 p.m. EDT. The contest was neck and neck, but Sanders later pulled ahead of Clinton. 
 
 As of 11 p.m., Sanders led 52 percent to 48 percent, with 95 percent of precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press. 
 
 Sanders said he believes he's the best candidate to take on Trump in November. The real estate mogul is now the presumptive GOP nominee after his landslide victory in Indiana prompted Texas Sen.

 The Vermont senator’s victory in the Hoosier State breaks Clinton's recent winning streak. But though he won Indiana, the state's Democratic primary allocates delegates proportionally, so he will barely make a dent in the former secretary of State's delegate lead. 
 
 Clinton is shy of the Democratic nomination by 182 delegates, according to the AP delegate tracker. Sanders would need to win every remaining pledged delegate and sway more superdelegates to his side to reach that threshold. 
 
 On Tuesday night, Sanders said he will continue to ""make the case"" to the superdelegates that reside in states where he claimed resounding victories. 
 
 ""I believe we’ll be able to make the case to many of those superdelegates that what is most important is not whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is the nominee,"" Sanders said. ""What is most important is that we do not allow someone like a Donald Trump to become president of the United States.""","– The GOP race may be all but over after Tuesday's Donald Trump victory in Indiana, but Bernie Sanders made it clear that the Democratic primaries still matter—and he intends to win them.

""And once we secure that position, I have absolute confidence that we are gonna defeat Donald Trump in the general election."" Sanders won Indiana with 52.5% of the vote to 47.5% for Clinton, according to the Washington Post, but although the win gives him momentum and another reason to stay in the race, the delegates are awarded proportionately, meaning he has only cut Clinton's lead by six.

151,"‘Kill them to salvage the tribe’s honour’ 
 
 A teenage couple accused of violating the Pashtun ‘code of honour’ killed with electric shocks. The murders executed by family members on the orders of a jirga of elders of the Mohmand tribe. 
 
 First to fall prey to misconstrued notions of honour was the 15-year-old girl. By the next sunrise, the 17-year-old boy too was no more. 
 
 Over the next few days, their bodies simply disappeared, buried in the dark of night. There was no mourning, no last rites and no prayers for the departed. 
 
 Any reader would be forgiven for assuming this brutal tragedy occurred somewhere in the tribal reaches of the country. But this was in Karachi, the largest urban centre of Pakistan, where the laws of the country apply in full force. 
 
 The area where this atrocity played out was Ali Brohi Goth, a locality in the suburbs of Karachi that falls with the jurisdiction of the Ibrahim Hyderi police. 
 
 As per information garnered from local residents and police sources, the wheels of tribal ‘justice’ were set in motion on August 14, the day the country celebrated 70 years of its existence. 
 
 The girl, 15-year-old Bakht Taj, daughter of Hikmat Khan, had allegedly attempted to elope with 17-year-old Rehman, son of Muhammad Afzal. Both families belong to the Safi sub-clan of the Mohmand tribe and reside in Ali Brohi Goth. 
 
 On Independence Day, Taj disappeared from her house with cash and jewellery. While she stayed at a house in the nearby area of Gulshan-e-Buner, Rehman was to remain at his own home so as to not arouse suspicion. 
 
 As Taj’s frantic parents scoured their daughter’s room for any clue to her whereabouts, they soon found a mobile SIM card registered in Rehman’s name. The oversight would prove fatal for the teenage couple as the elders managed to track Taj down and brought her home on the same day. 
 
 A broken agreement 
 
 Realising the gravity of the matter, Rehman’s father, Afzal, visited Taj’s house to meet her father, Hikmat, and extended a marriage proposal. Knowing well the possibility of violent retribution from Taj’s family, Afzal relied on another archaic tribal practice, Swara (offering girls of the family for marriage), to pacify Taj’s parents. 
 
 Along with promising to give two of his daughters for marriage, Afzal offered to bear all the expenses of Taj and Rehman’s wedding and also proffered a cow as compensation. 
 
 Sources who followed the developments told The News that Taj’s family had accepted Afzal’s offer. An agreement was reached between the two families and over a dozen elders of the Mohmand tribe residing in Ali Brohi Goth, Sherpao Colony and Muslimabad gathered on August 15 for a jirga to conclude the matter. 
 
 It was there that a staunchly conservative elder, Sartaj Khan alias Shagalai, raised objections to the agreement. In his rigid view, the jirga had to punish the teenagers to discourage such acts in the future and their families had to be the ones to kill their children, all to save their and the tribe’s ‘honour’. 
 
 Murder most foul 
 
 Shagalai’s contentions swayed the jirga members and the orders for cold-blooded murder were passed. The adolescents, though, were to die separately. 
 
 Taj’s life was taken first. Her father and uncle, Zar Khattab, made her consume a strong sedative and then tied the unconscious girl to a charpoy. She was then administered powerful electric shocks to end her life. 
 
 Taj was buried that night in secrecy by five tribesmen at the Maula Madad graveyard in Sherpao Colony. The next day, Rehman’s family was made to repeat the same harrowing exercise with their own flesh and blood. 
 
 Rehman’s father, Afzal, had opposed the decision but, according to his relatives, one of the jirga members threatened to have his family in his hometown harmed by Taliban militants if he failed to comply. 
 
 The law strikes 
 
 Everyone involved in the barbaric murders tried to keep it a secret. Fortunately, though, news of the killings soon reached the authorities. 
 
 Law enforcers have been conducting raids and the case has been transferred to the Shah Latif police. SHO Aman Marwat told The News that four people, including Afzal and Hikmat, had been arrested so far while efforts were afoot to track down the main instigator, Sartaj Khan alias Shagalai. The officer said the victims’ bodies would be exhumed on September 13 for autopsies. 
 
 Activists working on gender issues and women’s rights say the practice of killing people over misconstrued notions of honour remains rampant in the country, particularly among Pashtun tribesmen. 
 
 “Such incidents keep occurring in Karachi’s Pashtun-populated localities but due to geographical inaccessibility and an absence of a vibrant civil society in the neighbourhoods, news of these murders often does not make it to the media,” said Mahnaz Rahman, resident director of women’s rights body, Aurat Foundation. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Rights groups say honour killings are on the rise in Pakistan 
 
 The bodies of a teenage Pakistani couple feared murdered in an ""honour killing"" bear marks suggesting they were electrocuted, police say. 
 
 Officials exhumed the bodies of Bakht Jan, 15, and her boyfriend Rehman, 17, a month after they were buried. 
 
 Doctors, police and a magistrate were present at the graveside in Karachi. Post-mortem results are awaited. 
 
 Police say the couple were planning to elope but their families found out and tribal elders ordered them killed. 
 
 Death by electrocution is almost unheard of in so-called honour killings in Pakistan, says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad. The BBC reported a suspected case in the Indian capital Delhi in 2010. 
 
 Four people, including the fathers of the dead Karachi couple, have been arrested. Police are trying to trace the whereabouts of the head of the tribal council (or jirga). 
 
 District police head Rao Anwaar told the media that police had been alerted to the killings and burials by an ""informer"". 
 
 He said the bodies exhumed at Mauladad graveyard in Sherpao Colony on Wednesday had marks on the arms, chest and legs that indicated electrocution. 
 
 ""There were visible signs of electric shock and torture on both bodies,"" Civil Hospital Karachi Additional Police Surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi confirmed, Dawn newspaper reports. 
 
 Human rights groups say so-called honour killings are on the rise in Pakistan. Most victims are women who are not allowed to liaise or contract marriage with a man without approval of their families.

 Those involved in this case belong to the Pashtun Safi tribe from the north-western tribal region of Mohmand. 
 
 Zia Ur Rehman, a reporter for The News newspaper, which broke the story on Saturday, told the BBC that the families had reached a settlement in accordance with their tribal traditions. 
 
 ""Under the settlement, the couple were to wed and the boy's family would give the hand of two of its women in marriage to two men of the girl's family as the price of honour. 
 
 ""But a jirga called to endorse this settlement on 15 August rejected it and ordered the couple to be killed as a lesson to others."" 
 
 Police officer Aman Marwat told the BBC that the relatives arrested ""said that both the victims were drugged and then given electric shocks after being tied to a cot"". 
 
 He said that Bakht Jan left her home secretly on 14 August, but the family found her hours later at a nearby house waiting for Rehman, who had not yet arrived. 
 
 ""The girl was killed on 15 August, and the boy was killed the next day,"" police officer Marwat said. 
 
 Members of the tribal council were not contactable. Most are thought to be in hiding. No family members were available to comment. 
 
 Nearly 1,100 women were killed in Pakistan in 2015 by relatives who believed they had dishonoured their families, according to an April 2016 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. ||||| The bodies of a teenage couple in Karachi feared to have been murdered by their families after they wished to contract a free-will marriage were found bearing electrocution and torture marks following a post-mortem examination on Wednesday, officials said. 
 
 The bodies of the girl (15), and the boy (17), were exhumed from the Mauladad graveyard in Sherpao Colony in the presence of Azhar Ali Kalhoro, a judicial magistrate, and a team of doctors and police officials. 
 
 Civil Hospital Karachi Additional Police Surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi confirmed that ""there were visible signs of electric shock and torture on both bodies."" 
 
 Shah Latif Town Police Investigating Officer (IO) Ghulam Asghar Shaikh told Dawn that the girl and boy fled their homes on Aug 14 and stayed at the home of a relative in Sherpao Colony as they intended to marry of their own will. The relative, however, informed the parents of both victims, who then took them away. 
 
 After the development, a 30-35 person jirga was held, presided over by a local tribal elder identified as Sartaj, the IO said. 
 
 Following the jirga, the girl was electrocuted at around 11pm on Aug 15, while the boy was electrocuted around 3am on Aug 16, the IO added. 
 
 Police got wind of the case through an informant and subsequently filed a first information report on behalf of the state, after which four accused ─ the fathers and uncles of the victims ─ were arrested on Aug 21. 
 
 IO Shaikh said the accused, who had confessed to the crime, claimed to repent killing the children, alleging they were under the pressure of the jirga which urged them to murder the pair in order to to protect the 'honour' of their tribe.","– Authorities believe a teen couple murdered last month in Pakistan was killed by electrocution—an extremely rare method of death in so-called honor killings, the BBC reports. The bodies of a 15-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy were exhumed from a grave site in Karachi, and a postmortem examination was conducted Wednesday, according to Dawn. Authorities say marks on the victims' arms, chests, and legs indicate they were killed by electrocution. Four people—the fathers and uncles of the victims—have been arrested in connection with the murders. Authorities say the four have confessed to killing the teens and claim they were pressured by tribal elders to do so in order to protect the honor of the tribe. Authorities say the couple, who sought to marry, ran away from home Aug. 14 but were informed on by a relative. The News reports the two families tried to settle the matter themselves, with the girl's family agreeing to an offer of two girls for marriage and a cow from the boy's family in exchange for the victims' marriage. But one tribal elder reportedly quashed the deal, telling the families they must kill their children to prevent such behavior in the future. Police are currently looking for the tribal elder. Authorities say the girl was electrocuted Aug. 15 and the boy Aug. 16. The bodies were buried in the middle of the night. The family members were arrested Aug. 21.

152,"Major internet providers, including AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon, are slowing data from popular websites to thousands of US businesses and residential customers in dozens of cities across the country, according to a study released on Monday. 
 
 
 
 The study, conducted by internet activists BattlefortheNet, looked at the results from 300,000 internet users and found significant degradations on the networks of the five largest internet service providers (ISPs), representing 75% of all wireline households across the US. 
 
 The findings come weeks after the Federal Communications Commission introduced new rules meant to protect “net neutrality” – the principle that all data is equal online – and keep ISPs from holding traffic speeds for ransom. 
 
 Tim Karr of Free Press, one of the groups that makes up BattlefortheNet, said the finding show ISPs are not providing content to users at the speeds they’re paying for. 
 
 “For too long, internet access providers and their lobbyists have characterized net neutrality protections as a solution in search of a problem,” said Karr. “Data compiled using the Internet Health Test show us otherwise – that there is widespread and systemic abuse across the network. The irony is that this trove of evidence is becoming public just as many in Congress are trying to strip away the open internet protections that would prevent such bad behavior.” 
 
 The study, supported by the technologists at Open Technology Institute’s M-Lab, examines the comparative speeds of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which shoulder some of the data load for popular websites. Any site that becomes popular enough has to pay a CDN to carry its content on a network of servers around the country (or the world) so that the material is close to the people who want to access it. 
 
 In Atlanta, for example, Comcast provided hourly median download speeds over a CDN called GTT of 21.4 megabits per second at 7pm throughout the month of May. AT&T provided speeds over the same network of ⅕ of a megabit per second. When a network sends more than twice the traffic it receives, that network is required by AT&T to pay for the privilege. When quizzed about slow speeds on GTT, AT&T told Ars Technica earlier this year that it wouldn’t upgrade capacity to a CDN that saw that much outgoing traffic until it saw some money from that network (as distinct from the money it sees from consumers). 
 
 AT&T has strongly opposed regulation of its agreements with the companies that directly provide connectivity between high-traffic internet users and their customers. Cogent, Level3 and others have petitioned the FCC to make free interconnection to CDNs a part of the conditions for the proposed merger between AT&T and DirecTV. 
 
 “It would be unprecedented and unjustified to force AT&T to provide free backbone services to other backbone carriers and edge providers, as Cogent et al seek,” said the company in a filing replying to the CDNs’ suggestion, part of a brief opposing the merger. “Nor is there any basis for requiring AT&T to augment network capacity for free and without any limits. Opponents’ proposals would shift the costs of their services onto all AT&T subscribers, many of whom do not use Opponents’ services, and would harm consumers.” 
 
 FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has taken an aggressive regulatory tack when it comes to mergers in the telecommunications sector. “History proves that absent competition a predominant position in the market such as yours creates economic incentives to use that market power to protect your traditional business in a way that is ultimately harmful to consumers,” he told industry leaders at the Internet and Television Expo last month. 
 
 The dispute over traffic speeds comes as the telecoms and cable industry readies legal challenges to the net neutrality rules. Most telecoms are content letting their lobbyists, notably trade associations Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and USTelecom, sue the FCC over net neutrality rules, but AT&T has been one of the few companies to sue the FCC directly. ||||| WASHINGTON (CBS DC) — A new study claims massive Internet providers such as AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon are purposefully slowing data from popular websites to thousands of businesses and residential users across the country. 
 
 A study from Internet activists, BattlefortheNet, analyzed data from 300,000 Internet users and found the five largest Internet service providers (ISPs) have significantly degraded data speed, The Guardian reports. The purposeful internet service slow-down from the country’s largest internet provider companies affects 75 percent of all wireline households throughout the U.S. 
 
 The BattlefortheNet findings comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission introduced new rules meant to protect “net neutrality,” or the concept that all data on the Internet is equal. The rules are intended to keep ISPs such as AT&T, Time Warner, Verizon and Comcast from holding consumers’ traffic speeds for ransom. The country’s largest ISP companies urged the FCC to ignore consumer outcry and not view their networks as public utilities. 
 
 Last September, BattlefortheNet succeeded in overwhelming the federal government with millions of public comments demanding the FCC scrap its proposed rules for net neutrality and write new ones. Their day-long battle managed to send 1,000 calls per minute to members of Congress. 
 
 AT&T has continued to fight regulations of its services, calling them “unprecedented” and “unjustified” rules hurting their business. 
 
 Tim Karr of Free Press, one of many groups composing BattlefortheNet, said the study reflects that ISPs are continuing to refuse content to users at the speed for which they are paying. 
 
 “For too long, internet access providers and their lobbyists have characterized net neutrality protections as a solution in search of a problem,” Karr told The Guardian. “Data compiled using the Internet Health Test show us otherwise – that there is widespread and systemic abuse across the network. The irony is that this trove of evidence is becoming public just as many in Congress are trying to strip away the open internet protections that would prevent such bad behavior.” 
 
 One example provided by The Guardian from Atlanta shows Comcast “provided hourly median download speeds over a CDN called GTT of 21.4 megabits per second at 7pm throughout the month of May. AT&T provided speeds over the same network of ⅕ of a megabit per second.” 
 
 FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has been aggressive in his agreement that the large ISP companies must face regulation to protect consumers. 
 
 “History proves that absent competition a predominant position in the market such as yours creates economic incentives to use that market power to protect your traditional business in a way that is ultimately harmful to consumers,” he told industry leaders at the Internet and Television Expo last month. ||||| The Federal Communications Commission slapped AT&T with a $100 million fine Wednesday, accusing the country’s second-largest cellular carrier of drastically slowing down Internet speeds for customers who signed up for “unlimited” data plans. 
 
 The decision marks the FCC’s most aggressive step to date to regulate Internet providers as Chairman Tom Wheeler follows through with his pledge to ensure that consumers have uninterrupted access to the Web. Although the enforcement action targets AT&T’s cellular business, other broadband providers fear it is a preview of the greater scrutiny the industry will face under a more assertive FCC. 
 
 AT&T’s practice affected millions of customers who saw their Internet service slow to the equivalent of dial-up speeds for up to 12 days a month, the FCC said. Thousands of AT&T customers complained as they struggled to browse the Web or watch movies on their smartphones, according to the agency. 
 
 The fine is the largest ever levied by the FCC and faults AT&T for failing to adequately disclose that unlimited customers faced “throttling” of their Internet speeds if the company determined they were using too much data. 
 
 “Consumers deserve to get what they pay for,” Wheeler said in a statement. “Broadband providers must be upfront and transparent about the services they provide. The FCC will not stand idly by while consumers are deceived by misleading marketing materials and insufficient disclosure.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 AT&T said it would fight the fine. “We have been fully transparent with our customers, providing notice in multiple ways and going well beyond the FCC’s disclosure requirements,” the company said in a statement. 
 
 But the FCC said that AT&T’s disclosures did not go far enough and that the company should correct its misleading statements. 
 
 If AT&T is unsuccessful in challenging the fine, the money will go to the U.S. treasury, not to customers. AT&T should allow customers to drop their unlimited data plans without incurring a penalty, the FCC said. 
 
 AT&T stopped offering unlimited data plans to new customers in 2010, but those who already had such plans were allowed to keep them. The company declined to say how many customers have unlimited plans. 
 
 Unlimited contracts were once common among cellular providers but fell out of favor as consumer appetite grew for smartphones and mobile Internet. The amount of mobile data used last year jumped 26 percent, according to CTIA, the wireless industry’s top trade group. 
 
 The explosion of demand for data has made offering unlimited service too expensive, industry analysts have said. The only way to keep up, they say, is to “throttle,” or cap, Internet access for customers who use too much data playing games or watching videos. 
 
 Most cellular customers now have a limited amount of monthly data and are hit with extra fees when they exceed the cap. 
 
 Before implementing its “throttling” policy in 2011, AT&T allegedly tested the idea with several focus groups. The more participants learned about the program, however, the less they liked it, according to the FCC. Consumers told the company that the policy was inconsistent with its promise of truly “unlimited” data. Yet AT&T went ahead with the policy. 
 
 This isn’t the first time AT&T’s unlimited-data policy has landed the company in hot water. The Federal Trade Commission sued the telecom company in October, alleging that 3.5 million users had their Internet service slowed to dial-up speeds. The case is pending, and AT&T has said it would fight the charges. 
 
 The FCC fine comes at an awkward time for AT&T as it tries to persuade the FCC to approve its $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. The deal, which has been under scrutiny for more than a year, is considered essential to AT&T’s growth plans, including giving it access to valuable TV programming. 
 
 Consumer advocates said that while Wednesday’s decision is unlikely to jeopardize the deal, it reverses a long-standing perception that the FCC had gotten too cozy with industry. 
 
 “Big fines say, ‘Those days are over, and we expect you to behave,’ ” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge. “As broadband is recognized increasingly as the critical service for people . . . we’re seeing the consumer-protection agencies within the government taking it a lot more seriously.” 
 
 The FCC fined AT&T under a transparency rule that was enacted in 2010 as part of its “net neutrality” authority — a set of powers aimed at preventing Internet providers from interfering with how content is delivered to consumers. A federal court struck down those regulations last year, except for the transparency provision, which requires broadband companies to explain their practices clearly to consumers. This year, the FCC passed a new version of net neutrality that is designed to police Internet providers even more closely. 
 
 The FCC’s aggressive oversight of AT&T will probably spread to other companies, industry officials fear. T-Mobile, for example, also slows Internet speeds for some of its unlimited customers in certain cases. The company, the country’s fourth-largest cellular provider, declined to comment. Meanwhile, the agency is expected to consider a complaint against Time Warner Cable alleging that the nation’s second-largest cable provider is unfairly charging content providers to access its subscribers. 
 
 Industry groups and officials declined to comment publicly on the AT&T fine but said privately that they were worried. 
 
 “This signals a very strong intention of the FCC and its enforcement bureau to make examples of [Internet providers] where they think there’s a problem,” said a cable industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to comment freely. “It’s a signal to say, ‘Watch out, because we’re coming.’ ” 
 
 Ensuring that consumers have adequate access to the Internet has become a cornerstone of Wheeler’s tenure. In February, the FCC knocked down state limits on city-run Internet services in Tennessee and North Carolina, putting more pressure on large Internet providers. The agency has also increased funding for schools and libraries that need help buying high-speed Internet. 
 
 On Thursday, the FCC is expected to expand Lifeline, a Reagan-era program that once subsidized only basic telephone service but under Wheeler could also cover the cost of stand-alone high-speed Internet subscriptions for the first time.

154,"As technical failures bedevil the rollout of President Obama’s health care law, evidence is emerging that one of the program’s loftiest goals — to encourage competition among insurers in an effort to keep costs low — is falling short for many rural Americans. 
 
 While competition is intense in many populous regions, rural areas and small towns have far fewer carriers offering plans in the law’s online exchanges. Those places, many of them poor, are being asked to choose from some of the highest-priced plans in the 34 states where the federal government is running the health insurance marketplaces, a review by The New York Times has found. 
 
 Of the roughly 2,500 counties served by the federal exchanges, more than half, or 58 percent, have plans offered by just one or two insurance carriers, according to an analysis by The Times of county-level data provided by the Department of Health and Human Services. In about 530 counties, only a single insurer is participating. 
 
 The analysis suggests that the ambitions of the Affordable Care Act to increase competition have unfolded unevenly, at least in the early going, and have not addressed many of the factors that contribute to high prices. Insurance companies are reluctant to enter challenging new markets, experts say, because medical costs are high, dominant insurers are difficult to unseat, and powerful hospital systems resist efforts to lower rates. 
 
 “There’s nothing in the structure of the Affordable Care Act which really deals with that problem,” said John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute, who noted that many factors determine costs in a given market. “I think that all else being equal, premiums will clearly be higher when there’s not that competition.” 
 
 The Obama administration has said 95 percent of Americans live in areas where there are at least two insurers in the exchanges. But many experts say two might not be enough to create competition that would help lower prices. 
 
 For example, in Wyoming, two insurers are offering plans at prices that are higher than in neighboring Montana, where a third carrier is seen as a factor in keeping prices lower. 
 
 It is unclear how the online marketplaces might evolve over time. Many large insurers are closely watching what happens in the first year to decide whether to more aggressively pursue new markets. In the meantime, problems with the healthcare.gov Web site are making it harder for them to know whether the exchanges’ slow start is the result of technical difficulties or more serious underlying problems, such as a lack of consumer demand, that would discourage them from entering. 
 
 In some cases, competition varies markedly across county lines. In Monroe County, Fla., which includes the Florida Keys, two insurers, Cigna and Florida Blue, offer plans on the federal exchanges. In neighboring Miami-Dade County, there are seven companies, including Aetna and Humana, two of the nation’s largest players. 
 
 In rural Baker County, Ga., where there is only one insurer, a 50-year-old shopping for a silver plan would pay at least $644.05 before federal subsidies. (Plans range in price and levels of coverage from bronze to platinum, with silver a middle option.) A 50-year-old in Atlanta, where there are four carriers, could pay $320.06 for a comparable plan. Federal subsidies could significantly reduce monthly premiums for people with low incomes. 
 
 Counties with one carrier are mostly concentrated in the South. Nearly all of the counties in Mississippi and Alabama, for example, are served by just one insurer, according to The Times’s analysis. Other states with scarce competition include Maine, West Virginia, North Carolina and Alaska. 
 
 “The consumer wants some level of choice,” said Alexander K. Feldvebel, the deputy insurance commissioner for New Hampshire, where one carrier, Anthem Blue Cross, owned by WellPoint, now offers plans. “You don’t have that when you have a single carrier offering all the products.” ||||| WASHINGTON—No one in the government made sure the many complex parts of the federal health-insurance website worked together properly, and testing of the complete site didn't take place until two weeks before its Oct. 1 launch, contractors said at the first congressional hearings into the matter.

Michael Burgess (R., Texas), as contractors for the site...","– ObamaCare's technical difficulties are well-documented—the House is dragging four contractors in to talk about them today—but it has one problem no web developer can solve: It's pretty lousy in rural areas. The theory behind the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplace is that forcing insurers to compete will keep prices low. But in many rural areas, that competition simply isn't materializing, the New York Times reports. In 21% of the 2,500 counties serviced by the federal exchanges, consumers have only one carrier to choose from. Among the reasons why new insurers aren't stepping in: ""dominant"" insurers hold tightly to their territory, and ""powerful"" hospital systems fiercely oppose any moves that would trim their rates. Most under-served areas are poor, and many are in the South; there's only one option in almost all of Mississippi and Alabama. That lack of competition can have a huge effect on prices. A 50-year-old in rural Georgia, for instance, would pay twice as much for a silver-level plan as one in Atlanta. The cheapest silver plan in Wyoming, which has two insurers, costs as much as the most expensive in Montana, which has three (including one new co-op). ""The Affordable Care Act was designed for … big cities,"" Wyoming's insurance commissioner says. ""You've got to have some bargaining chips, and we don't have that much.""",<pad> failures.</s>,0.0,0.0,0.0
155,"Robert Buchel, who appeared on the TLC show ""My 600 Pound Life"" has died. 
 
 The New Jersey resident, who weighed 842 pounds, was featured on Wednesday night's episode where viewers learned he suffered a heart attack during the filming of the show. 
 
 Buchel had undergone weight loss surgery and was placed on a strict diet before he died suddenly of a heart attack on Nov. 17, 2017. Fans only learned of his death last night. 
 
 ""TLC was deeply saddened by the loss of Robert. We are grateful to his family who were gracious enough to let us continue to share his brave story with our viewers,"" TLC told Fox News. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time."" 
 
 Buchel's fiancee Kathryn said at his funeral, ""I lost my best friend and the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with."" 
 
 Prior to his death, Buchel said in the episode, ""To carry all this weight is physically draining, mentally, emotionally taxing,"" Robert said. ""It's not a pain or life I’d wish on anyone because I can't do anything. I can’t do anything for anyone — especially myself so I am completely dependent on my fiancee."" 
 
 The pair were due to marry next year. ||||| A participant on the TLC reality series ""My 600-Lb. Life"" became the first cast member to die during filming in an episode that aired Wednesday. 
 
 Robert Buchel's lifelong battle with obesity was chronicled for season six of the hit series, and viewers watched in heartbreaking detail how Buchel steadily improved by shedding more than 200 pounds before ultimately suffering a fatal heart attack in November at age 41. 
 
 ""TLC was deeply saddened by the loss of Robert,"" the network said in a statement. ""We are grateful to his family who were gracious enough to let us continue to share his brave story with our viewers. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time."" 
 
 Accompanying Buchel for much of his journey was fiancée Kathryn Lemanski, who moved with her husband-to-be to Texas from New Jersey to aid as he continued his treatment.

 Buchel — whose weight ballooned to 842 pounds thanks to a lifelong food addiction — made quick progress at first, shedding 217 pounds at a Houston hospital in preparation for lymphedema removal surgery. 
 
 Once Buchel had his surgery, however, his previously unacknowledged addiction to painkillers kicked in, and he grew depressed and struggled to make progress as his body deteriorated. In a desperate bid at scoring more painkillers, he tore his surgery stitches.

 Buchel was forced to leave his rehabilitation center for a long-term care facility after it became clear he was no longer trying to stay active, and shortly after, suffered a heart attack and died. 
 
 His final moment on screen ended on a hopeful note, as Buchel expressed interest in making progress for the sake of his fiancée.

 But not long after, Lemanski appeared on screen to recount their final night together, saying that Buchel told her he didn't feel well and didn't think he'd make it through the night. 
 
 ""He told me, 'I don't think I'll make it through the night. I love you and I always will,'"" she said. ""I lost my best friend and the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with."" 
 
 A GoFundMe was launched in support of Lemanski shortly after Buchel's death in order to help her pay off debts she'd accumulated helping care for him. 
 
 Buchel was the first participant of the series to die during filming, though season one's Henry Foots died in 2013 of an illness unrelated to his weight loss surgery.

 Buchel, 41, was the subject of Wednesday night’s episode of the reality show, and had successfully lost nearly 200 lbs. after moving with his fiancé, Kathryn Lemanski, from New Jersey to Houston. But his addiction to painkillers derailed surgeon Dr. Younan Nowzaradan’s efforts to help, and Buchel passed away on Nov. 15, 2017. 
 
 In a statement to PEOPLE, TLC said they were “deeply saddened” by his loss. 
 
 They added: “We are grateful to his family who were gracious enough to let us continue to share his brave story with our viewers. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time.” 
 
 Lemanski wrote on Facebook that Buchel struggled knowing that his life wasn’t going the way he had hoped. 
 
 “Rob suffered from never realizing how good a man he was and always felt inadequate and a failure,” she wrote two days after his death. “Thank you to all of you for validating my love for him. I knew what kind of soul he had but could never convince him of how truly special he was. A person like him should never have to die this way and certainly not this young and most definitely not when his life was about to begin.” 
 
 Lemanski added that Buchel was becoming optimistic for his future after losing weight in the hospital. 
 
 “Rob had a hard life, and in the last two months he finally had hope for the life he always wanted,” she said. 
 
 A friend of Lemanski’s created a GoFundMe page to raise money for Buchel’s medical bills and funeral costs, and to help her move back to New Jersey. 
 
 “Kathryn incurred a crushing debt, between medical bills and moving expenses, only to have to pack up, turn around and move back,” they wrote. “Kathryn is one of the most selfless and giving individuals one could ever meet, she is well deserving of any help that can be offered.” ||||| I don't know how to start what is going to be the most painful facebook post I will ever write. I know this is late and I would like to apologize to everyone that I haven't been able to reach out to all of you before it was released to facebook. On Wednesday, November 15, 2017, the love of my life, my best friend, my closest confidant, Robert Buchel passed away suddenly. I wish I could say that my heart was broken or even shattered, but in reality it is just gone. My heart died along with him. Our future together died along with him. Next year we were going to be getting married in Walt Disney World and have our own Disney Fairytale Wedding. We were going to start a family. We were going to grow old together. Everything we were ever going to be can now never be. He did not deserve to go this way and this was not his time. 14 years together is not enough and although many people say it's better to love the time you have than to mourn the time you don't: no offense but screw you. Rob had a hard life and in the last 2 months he finally had hope for the life he always wanted. This was a robbery beyond words. And thanks to those of you who have reached out to me, I realize now that this robbery is more dispicable than I thought. The memories and the love that I have been seeing for him has been overwhelming. I am overjoyed at how much love he had given but also received from all of you. I am also angered beyond words that he's not here to continue to love and be loved. And even moreseo I am saddened that he died not realizing how much love you all really had for him. Rob suffered from never realizing how good a man he was and always felt inadequate and a failure. Thank you to all of you for validating my love for him. I knew what kind of soul he had but could never convince him of how truly special he was. A person like him should never have to die this way and certainly not this young and most definitely not when his life was about to begin. Arrangements have not been made yet, but his mother and I will be settling things here in Texas as we wait for his remains. Once we have him back, we will bring him home and I promise you that I will notify you when his memorial is scheduled. You all meant so much to him and I thank you all for being there. Please keep his mom and family and friends in your thoughts. This has been difficult for all of us. But most of all, please do this for me: take lessons from him. Every morning he would tell me or text me ""good morning angel"". Every phone call ended with ""I love you."" Every night he would text me or tell me ""Goodnight my love."" In fact the night before he passed he told me ""If I don't wake up tomorrow please know that I have always loved you."" Tell that person you love that you love them. The only consolation I have right now is that we were together and that his last words of peace to me were how he felt about me and how I felt about him. And when he did pass, he was not alone. I was there holding his hand. Thank you to the doctors and nurses who worked tirelessly for almost three hours to bring him back to me. Although I do not know your names, please understand your efforts will not be forgotten. I still have his phone on and his facebook is still live. I will see your messages to him and I will try to respond, You can also contact me directly as well. Thank you all for loving him.","– TLC reality show My 600-lb Life profiles the efforts of the obese to lose weight, but viewers were given heartbreaking news in this week's episode: Robert Buchel, a New Jersey man who weighed 842 pounds at the start of the episode, did not survive filming.

156,"The host, who has been with the series since 2005, will sign off in December. 
 
 CBS, as expected, is making a change at Late Late Show, with host Craig Ferguson announcing Monday that he will sign off from the series in December. 
 
 Ferguson will make the announcement during Monday’s show, which features guests LL Cool J and The Vampire Diaries’ Candice Accola. 
 
 The Late Late Show change means CBS’ entire late-night lineup will undergo a facelift, with The Colbert Report’s Stephen Colbert already having been tapped to replace a retiring David Letterman as host of Late Show starting in 2015. 
 
 “During his 10 years as host, Craig has elevated CBS to new creative and competitive heights at 12:30,” CBS Entertainment chairman Nina Tassler said in a release. “He infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television. Craig’s versatile talents as a writer, producer, actor and comedian speak to his great days ahead. While we’ll miss Craig and can’t thank him enough for his contributions to both the show and the network, we respect his decision to move on, and we look forward to celebrating his final broadcasts during the next eight months.” 
 
 News of Ferguson’s Late Late Show departure comes as his contract with CBS to host the talker was set to expire this year. Sources told THR that Letterman’s production company Worldwide Pants would likely no longer produce a late-night show following Letterman’s exit. (CBS currently co-produces Late Late Night with Worldwide Pants.) 
 
 “CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are ‘consciously uncoupling,’ but we will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much,” Ferguson said. 
 
 Following CBS’ Colbert announcement, speculation over who would take over the 12:35 a.m. slot for Ferguson has run the gamut, with the host/comedian’s exit widely anticipated. The Ferguson-hosted Late Late Show has been averaging less than half of what NBC’s new Late Night With Seth Meyers is pulling in the key adults 18-49 demographic. 
 
 CBS president and CEO Leslie Moonves has reportedly been open to candidates outside the traditional mold, with How I Met Your Mother alum Neil Patrick Harris believed to be interested in the job. Harris, 40, a three-time host of the Tony Awards, has twice hosted the Primetime Emmy Awards as well as the World Magic Awards and the Spike Video Game Awards. 
 
 The network ruled out Chelsea Handler for the Late Late Show gig earlier this month, telling THR that “there are no discussions” with the E! show host to take over the network’s 12:35 a.m. late-night broadcast. Handler had a general meeting with CBS' syndication group and is rumored to be in talks with Netflix for a new show. 
 
 Meanwhile, Ferguson already has his follow-up gig lined up: hosting FremantleMedia North America’s syndicated game show Celebrity Name Game. 
 
 The Late Late Show becomes the latest late-night show to make a change at the top. Jimmy Fallon took over NBC’s The Tonight Show, with Meyers taking his seat at Late Night; and Colbert is in for Letterman at CBS. Ferguson has been the host of the Late Late Show since 2005 when he took over for Craig Kilborn. 
 
 During his run, Ferguson earned a Peabody Award in 2009 and an Emmy nomination in 2006. ||||| Late-night television has one more opening: Craig Ferguson announced on his CBS show Monday night that he will leave “The Late Late Show” at the end of the year. 
 
 Mr. Ferguson, whose contract was scheduled to end at that time, took the issue into his own hands and informed CBS executives that he would make the announcement Monday night. Mr. Ferguson has been the host of the CBS 12:35 a.m. show since January 2005. 
 
 Mr. Ferguson said in a statement, “CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are ‘consciously uncoupling,’ but we will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much,” referring to two favorite props on the show. 
 
 The move comes a little more than three weeks after David Letterman announced that he would be leaving his own 11:35 p.m. late-night show on CBS and concluding his late-night career at the end of his contract next year. CBS moved quickly to name his replacement, Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central’s “Colbert Report.” ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — A few weeks after David Letterman announced he'd be retiring from the CBS late-night television lineup, Craig Ferguson did the same.

 Ferguson, host of ""The Late Late Show"" since 2005, told his studio audience during Monday's taping that he will step down at the end of the year. Ferguson's show airs after Letterman's, at 12:35 a.m. on weekdays. 
 
 The move was no surprise after CBS announced that Stephen Colbert will replace Letterman next year. There was a time that Ferguson, whose show won a Peabody Award in 2009, was considered a strong contender for that job. 
 
 But ""The Late Late Show"" has faded in the ratings, particularly with the arrival of Seth Meyers in February as competition in the same time slot. 
 
 ""CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are consciously uncoupling,"" Ferguson said. ""But we will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much."" 
 
 He told the audience it was his decision to leave, adding, ""CBS has been fine with me."" 
 
 CBS Entertainment Chairwoman Nina Tassler said Ferguson ""infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television."" 
 
 The Scottish-born Ferguson, 51, became a U.S. citizen during his tenure on the show. 
 
 He already has a new job lined up, as host of ""Celebrity Name Game,"" a syndicated game show set to debut later this year. 
 
 But he joked about his plans with the audience. 
 
 After his stint ends, ""I'll go and do something else. Probably, I'm thinking, carpentry. But I haven't made my mind up yet. ... I feel like doing this show for 10 years, that's enough,"" he said. 
 
 Guest LL Cool J told Ferguson that ""I hate to see you go."" 
 
 It's been an unusually busy period of personnel changes in the late-night television arena. Jimmy Fallon took over the ""Tonight"" show on NBC from Jay Leno in February and was an instant sensation, ascending to the top of the ratings against Letterman and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel. Letterman announced that he would be leaving CBS after more than three decades in late-night TV. 
 
 Chelsea Handler also has said she will be leaving her late-night show on E! 
 
 CBS said it plans to continue ""The Late Late Show"" and will be searching for another host. There's another opening at Comedy Central, which is looking to replace ""The Colbert Report"" when it ends at the end of the year.

157,"United States Attorney Laura E. Duffy announced today that Jan C. Seski, M.D. & Associates, P.C., an oncology practice based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of having caused the introduction of an unapproved drug into interstate commerce and was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford also ordered the defendant to place ads in two medical journals, warning of the dangers of unapproved drugs. 
 
 In pleading guilty earlier today before Judge Crawford, the medical practice admitted that between December 4, 2008 and May 25, 2011, the practice ordered $973,795 worth of foreign versions of the oncology drugs Eloxatin7, Gemzar7, and Taxotere7 from GlobalRxStore.com and had them shipped through Oberlin Medical Supply of San Diego. The drugs ordered by the practice were determined to be foreign versions of these drugs and were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States. 
 
 According to sentencing documents filed with the court, this case came to light in May 2011, when federal agents visited Oberlin Medical Supply's offices in San Diego. Maher Idriss, (charged in Criminal Case No. 12cr1775-WQH) the owner of Oberlin Medical Supply, had been working in conjunction with Martin Bean (charged in Criminal Case No. 12cr3734-WQH) and others of GlobalRxStore.com (GlobalRx) to supply foreign oncology drugs to doctors throughout the United States. At Oberlin, the agents discovered numerous boxes of oncology drugs that bore labeling indicating that the products had been manufactured outside of the United States and were not approved for use in this country. 
 
 The medical practice provided agents with a copy of a label for boxes of Gemzar received from GlobalRx. The labeling indicated that the product was manufactured by Eli Lilly in Fegershaim, France. The labeling was partially in English and partially in Turkish. The labels did not bear the words ""Rx only"" as required by the FDA and did not bear the National Drug Code (NDC) numbers used for Medicare billing in this country. Moreover, the labels were different in color from the FDA-approved labeling for the U.S. product. 
 
 The medical practice later provided to the government one of the vials of drugs that was in the box. When tested, the vial was found to have the active ingredient used in the manufacture of Gemzar. However, without such testing there is no assurance that other foreign drugs purchased by the defendant (outside of the closed chain system established by the FDA to protect patients in this country) all contain the active ingredient. Just recently, in February, 2013, the FDA warned doctors about batches of counterfeit Avastin (an oncology drug) that had been sold to U.S. doctors that did not contain any of the active ingredients, the third such incident in several months.

 Zimbabwe's National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority accused Jan Casimir Seski of Murrysville, Pennsylvania, of shooting the lion with a bow and arrow in April near Hwange National Park, without approval, on land where it was not allowed. 
 
 Landowner Headman Sibanda was arrested and is assisting police, it said. 
 
 Seski is a gynecological oncologist who directs the Center for Bloodless Medicine and Surgery at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. 
 
 He's also an active big-game hunter, according to safari outfitters and bow-hunting sites where kill shots identify ""Dr. Jan Seski"" as the man standing next to slain animals including elephants, a hippo, an ostrich and antelopes such as an impala, a kudu, and a nyala. 
 
 The Associated Press called and knocked on the door at Seski's home, which is set back among some woods outside Pittsburgh. The AP also left a message with an answering service for his medical practice, with no immediate response. 
 
 One image on the Melorani Safaris Facebook page, since taken down, showed Seski posing with the body of a small antelope in 2012, with a caption saying it was killed two days after he shot it with an arrow. Other captions described how his arrows penetrated organs and split bones. 
 
 ""This Zimbabwe elephant is the sixth African elephant shot by Dr. Jan Seski,"" Alaska Bowhunting Supply claims in a caption dated September 2014, below a picture of the doctor posing above the dead beast's trunk and tusks. 
 
 ""The arrow was shot quartering into the elephant, penetrated a rib and one lung, lacerated the heart and liver, and was recovered in the gut. The elephant went a short distance and died. With results like this, no wonder Jan is a firm supporter of our Ultra-Magnum Arrow System."" 
 
 Alaska Bowhunting Supply didn't immediately respond Sunday to a request for comment, and it wasn't clear how the hunting supply company learned such details about the hunt. 
 
 Images of the doctor wearing camouflage and holding high-powered bows match those on Seski's website, where he wears a suit or hospital scrubs. His address and other identifying information given by authorities in Zimbabwe matches those of U.S. medical authorities. 
 
 A handful of Seski's neighbors said he mostly keeps to himself and that he'd been buying up the land around his property. Ernest Hahn said Seski put up no-trespassing signs, breaking the rural area's tradition of people feeling free to cross property lines to hunt. 
 
 Hahn said Seski can be ""quirky,"" walking around wearing a low-slung pistol ""like a gunslinger,"" for example, but he appreciates that his neighbor is protecting land from development. 
 
 ""It seemed to me everything he does is aboveboard,"" Hahn said. ""I've never seen him done anything illegal or unsportsmanlike at all."" 
 
 Seski provided his name and other identifying information for a government database when he came for the hunt, Zimbabwe National Parks spokeswoman Caroline Washaya Moyo said. 
 
 ""When hunters come into the country they fill a document stating their personal details, the amount they have paid for the hunt, the number of animals to be hunted, the species to be hunted and the area and period where that hunt is supposed to take place,"" she said. ""The American conducted his hunt in an area where lion hunting is outlawed. The landowner who helped him with the hunt also did not have a have a quota for lion hunting."" 
 
 Seski seemed like a ""perfect gentleman"" to Stewart Dorrington, who operates Melorani Safaris and owns a game reserve in neighboring South Africa where Seski hunted in 2012. 
 
 ""He was a great guy,"" Dorrington said. ""Everything he did was perfectly legal and aboveboard and a great help to our conservation efforts."" 
 
 Dorrington said he converted his cattle ranch into a game reserve in the 1980s. He said funds from trophy hunting of antelope are essential to conserving wildlife. 
 
 Dorrington said he received an abusive phone call Sunday; his Facebook page was later closed from view after people began posting threatening comments. 
 
 Two other illegal lion hunts also were recorded last year in Zimbabwe, said Geoffrey Matipano, conservation director for the wildlife authority. He did not provide details on those cases. 
 
 Zimbabwean authorities have said they will seek the extradition of Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer, alleging he lacked authorization to kill ""Cecil."" The lion was lured out of Hwange park, wounded with a bow and arrow and then tracked down and shot, conservationists said. 
 
 Palmer said he relied on professional guides to ensure his hunt was legal. Two Zimbabwean citizens were arrested and face charges. 
 
 Zimbabwe's wildlife authority has suspended the hunting of lions, leopards and elephants in the Hwange area, and said Saturday that bow and arrow hunts can be approved by only by the head of the wildlife authority. 
 
 In Washington, meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., announced the ""Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large (CECIL) Animal Trophies Act,"" which would expand import bans to species proposed for listing as threatened or endangered, as well as those already listed as endangered. 
 
 ""The logic is that if you keep killing them, they will become endangered,"" Menendez spokesman Steven Sandberg said Sunday.

 ' We view our patients' needs as a challenge, not as a problem."" - Dr. Seski 
 
 ||||| The world's most-hated dentist has some company. 
 
 Pittsburgh doctor Jan Seski is accused of killing a lion during an illegal hunt with a bow and arrow near Zimbabwe’s protected Hwange National Park in April, the African nation’s government said Sunday. 
 
 Seski, 68, is a gynecologic oncologist and surgeon with a private practice. 
 
 A Zimbabwean landowner, Headman Sibanda, was also arrested and is assisting police with their investigation of the doctor, the National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority said. 
 
 Sibanda is facing charges for hunting without a permit at his Railway Farm 31. He also is the owner of Nyala Safaris, which allegedly guided Seski. 
 
 Seski is the second American doctor who has been named in an illegal lion hunt. Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer created an international outcry when he killed a beloved lion named Cecil in Zimbabwe last month.

 On Sunday, one of Seski’s neighbors said the doctor once threatened to kill his Australian shepherd pups after they ran onto his sprawling property set back among woods outside Pittsburgh and dotted with “no hunting” signs. 
 
 “He brought them back with his caretaker,” recalled neighbor Ernie Hahn. “He doesn’t go anywhere by himself. And he told me, ‘You know, I could have shot them.’”

 Hahn, 67, said he tried to avoid talking with the socially awkward doctor. 
 
 “He’s rich and he owns all this,” Hahn said. “He’s real private. He buys people like us. You don’t want to cross him.” 
 
 Pictures on social media show Seski, who has a hunting license in Alaska, is an active hunter. 
 
 A 2012 post from Melorani Safaris’ Facebook page indicated Seski went on a 10-day hunt and “harvested some very nice animals,” including a nyala, a type of antelope, and a giraffe. 
 
 “Congratulations to Jan on a very succesfull (sic) hunt!!” the post read. 
 
 One photo shows the doctor posing with the body of a small antelope; a caption says it was killed two days after he shot it with an arrow. 
 
 Other captions described how his arrows penetrated organs and split bones. 
 
 “This Zimbabwe elephant is the sixth African elephant shot by Dr. Jan Seski,” Alaska Bowhunting Supply claims in a caption dated September 2014, below a picture of the doctor posing above the dead beast’s trunk and tusks.

 “The arrow was shot quartering into the elephant, penetrated a rib and one lung, lacerated the heart and liver, and was recovered in the gut,” the caption reads. “The elephant went a short distance and died. With results like this, no wonder Jan is a firm supporter of our Ultra-Magnum Arrow System.” 
 
 Despised doctors Seski and Palmer are not alone in their hunting ways. 
 
 Hunters have exported the head and hide of an estimated 665 wild lions from Africa each year, according to reports.

 In addition, hunters took down between 15 to 20 rhinos in Zimbabwe last year. 
 
 In Pittsburgh, Seski directs the Center for Bloodless Medicine and Surgery at the Allegheny General Hospital. 
 
 “We have no comment at this time on this matter related to Dr. Seski,” said hospital spokesman Dan Laurent, who noted the doctor is an “independent, private-practice physician who has attending privileges at several of our hospitals.” 
 
 In 2013, Seski’s practice pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of ordering unapproved cancer drugs and was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of California. 
 
 The practice admitted to ordering $973,795 worth of foreign versions of oncology drugs between Dec. 4, 2008, and May 25, 2011, that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the U.S. 
 
 Palmer has gone into hiding and is facing extradition to Zimbabwe to face charges of financing an illegal hunt. 
 
 The dentist has said he relied on his local guides to ensure his hunt was legal. 
 
 Online commenters were quick to vilify the latest trophy-hunting doctor. 
 
 “Another ‘person’ who is trained to preserve life, yet takes pleasure in paying to kill,” Elizabeth Stahlmann wrote on Seski’s office Facebook page. 
 
 “If you want to fund Dr. Seski’s illegal hunts and you approve of him giving his patients illegal drugs that are not FDA approved by all means go see him,” added Andrea Hansen. 
 
 Others were more direct, calling him “killer,” “scum” and “sociopath.” 
 
 Not everyone was upset by the doctor’s macabre hobby. 
 
 “We are very recent patients of his, he is a fantastic surgeon and amazing clinician,” said Nihar Ghate in an email to the Daily News. “I feel sorry for those so quick to judge such a great doctor.” 
 
 Seski also appears to have gone into hiding. 
 
 Messages left for the doctor were not returned Sunday.

Officials there say in a press release that Jan Casmir Sieski of Murrysville, Pa., joined a hunt in April near Hwange National Park, where an American dentist recently coaxed out and killed a famous lion. The New York Times finds no Jan Casmir Sieski on record, but spotted a Jan Casimir Seski running a gynecological oncologist practice in Pittsburgh. The AP knocked on his door in a wooded area near Pittsburgh, and called his practice, but hasn't heard back. Meanwhile, pictures on social media (now removed) show the 68-year-old posing with wildlife he apparently killed in Africa, including antelope and elephants. The AP says he's specifically accused of illegal lion-hunting. Seski's neighbors describe him as mostly a loner. One says he's ""quirky"" and carries a low-slung handgun ""like a gunslinger,"" but adds that ""I've never seen him done anything illegal or unsportsmanlike at all."" Turns out Seski pleaded guilty to allowing $973,795 in unapproved, foreign oncology drugs into the US between 2008 and 2011, the Daily News reports. According to an official document, he was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. He's also seen as a trailblazer in bloodless surgery.

 Microsoft and Sony have been working to restore internet platforms for their Xbox and PlayStation games consoles. 
 
 Attacks disabled the online services on Christmas Day, making it difficult for users to log on. 
 
 The Xbox Live status page suggested on Saturday that Microsoft services had been restored. PlayStation said it was getting to grips with the issue and thanked users for their patience. 
 
 A hacking group called Lizard Squad claimed to have caused the problems. 
 
 The name is the same used by a group of hackers that has targeted Sony in the past. 
 
 Microsoft's Xbox Live has 48 million subscribers and Sony's PlayStation system has more than double that number, at about 110 million users. 
 
 In a tweet posted on Saturday morning, PlayStation said: ""Update: PS4, PS3, and Vita network services are gradually coming back online - thanks for your patience."" 
 
 A later statement said: ""We are seeing reduced reports of network issues. We'll continue to monitor."" 
 
 'Member Two' 
 
 A hacker claiming to be from Lizard Squad - a 22-year-old calling himself Member Two - said it had hacked the sites ""because we can"". 
 
 He also suggested the motive was to demonstrate weaknesses in the two companies systems. 
 
 ""It's just such a huge company Microsoft... Do you not think they should be able to prevent such an attack?"" he told BBC Radio 5live. 
 
 ""Is Christmas really about children playing with their new consoles, or playing with their new toys, or is it about them spending time with their families and celebrating Christmas?"" he added. 
 
 ""I think everyone's just taking it all out of the ordinary.""

 Sony executives must be asking themselves - when will it stop? 
 
 The attack on the PlayStation network - along with Microsoft's Xbox Live network - is nothing like as serious and sophisticated as the Sony Pictures hack. 
 
 But the impact on customers is more direct, and the fact that the company has taken longer than Microsoft to get its network up and running is another blow to the reputation of its security operation. 
 
 The distributed denial of service attack which overwhelmed the servers at Sony and Microsoft appears to have been on a very large scale, and came when traffic would have already been very high. 
 
 But customers are just as angry with Lizard Squad, the group which claims it launched the attack - and has since justified it with some rather pompous statements about exposing poor security. 
 
 The group now appears to have set its sights on bringing down Tor, the secure network which enables anonymous online communication. That has incurred the wrath of the better known hacker collective Anonymous - so prepare for more online conflict in the coming days. 
 
 Services disconnected 
 
 To make the most of the Xbox and PlayStation consoles players have to connect to the internet in order to reach the console manufacturers' servers. 
 
 The outage stopped people accessing some core services, such as registering a new account, connecting with other people to play the same game and connecting to entertainment channels via the console. 
 
 Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A hacking group called Lizard Squad claimed to have caused the problem 
 
 Earlier this month a different branch of Sony - Sony Pictures Entertainment - was hit by a cyber attack that stole huge amounts of data from its servers. 
 
 The fallout from that hack soon focussed on The Interview, a film featuring a fictional plot to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. 
 
 No link between Sony Pictures hack and the gaming service disruptions has been confirmed. 
 
 However, the latest disruption did mean that many families were unable to enjoy their new Christmas presents. 
 
 In the UK, Ros Bruce, from Essex, said her 10-year-old son got an Xbox One for Christmas, had spent most of the day in tears, and called for Xbox to provide compensation. 
 
 Ian Hornby, from Lancashire, spent a frustrating time trying to connect a new PlayStation to the Sony network, and said he hoped that the electronics giant would now invest in better protection for its systems. ||||| Gamers who received new consoles for Christmas might find themselves unable to connect and play with friends, thanks to a coordinated attack by hackers who claim to have taken down the two largest gaming networks. On what might be the biggest gaming day of the year, a hacker group called Lizard Squad is claiming responsibility for taking down both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. 
 
 Reports of service disruptions began popping up earlier today, with both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network acknowledging issues with some core services. In both cases, users have had a difficult time logging in to the networks, which generally gives them access to connect with friends and play games requiring online access. 
 
 We are aware that there have been issues reported with PSN. Thanks for your patience as we investigate. — Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) December 24, 2014 
 
 A hacker group called Lizard Squad claims to be behind the attacks, which follow weeks of threatening to take the systems offline. This is the same group that said it was behind PlayStation Network and Blizzard outages in August that took down games like League of Legends and Path of Exile. 
 
 https://twitter.com/FUCKCRUCIFIX/status/548168352666247168 
 
 For those who just got a shiny new PS4 or XBOne for Christmas, the attack couldn’t have come at a worse time. That’s because new users generally have to be connected to one of those networks even just to set up their Xbox or PlayStation accounts for the first time. 
 
 And what are those gamers supposed to do for the rest of the day? Spend time with their families? ||||| Sony’s online PlayStation store and Microsoft’s Xbox Live network have been disrupted over Christmas in what is thought to have been a cyber-attack on the companies. 
 
 
 
 The network outages, which have left millions of users unable to play games and access entertainment channels, are continuing into a second day. 
 
 Sony said on Friday that some users were having trouble logging into its network and engineers were investigating. Microsoft said it knew some users were having trouble signing in. “We’re aware of this issue and we’re working to find a fix ASAP.” 
 
 An online entity calling itself Lizard Squad, regarded as a serial nuisance by gamers the world over, appeared to take responsibility for the disruptions via its Twitter account. A DDoS attack, which bombards servers with spurious traffic, was thought to have been the method used. 
 
 The PlayStation store also experienced spells of inaccessibility earlier this month. That followed the hacking of computer systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment, followed by the release of confidential information on the internet. 
 
 Sony and Microsoft had both expected heavy use over Christmas as people who received their computer games tried to hook up. The problems may have been exacerbated by Sony’s decision to let consumers download controversial movie The Interview through Xbox Video as well as other online sources. 
 
 Microsoft said in an online message: “Are you having a rough time signing in to Xbox Live? We’re working to get this figured out right away. We appreciate your patience.” 
 
 Sony similarly pleaded for patience. “We are aware that some users are experiencing difficulty logging into the PSN,” it said. 
 
 On Thursday Microsoft Xbox spokesman Sean McCarthy had declined to give details of how the company may have been preparing for security breaches, given the problems that Sony has experienced in releasing The Interview. 
 
 “Of course it’s safe to say holiday season is always a very busy time of year for any consumer electronics company, so we work hard to ensure the stability of our infrastructure when so many consoles are activating for the first time.”

 Incident and a hack of Sony Pictures don't appear to be related 
 
 Lizard Squad hacker group has claimed responsibility for prior attacks 
 
 One Twitter user bemoans issue, stuck with cranky teenager 
 
 (CNN) Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Live gaming networks experienced widespread problems on Christmas Day as a hacker group claimed responsibility for what it said was an attack. 
 
 Hundreds of users took to Twitter to report problems with the systems, which lasted much of the day. 
 
 ""With the #Xbox hacking shutdown going on I'm watching my 15 year old nephew meltdown: 'I've got nothing else to do!!!!'"" Jim Crilley Jr. wrote on the social messaging site. 
 
 The problem persisted for hours, but Thursday night Xbox Live briefly posted a message on its support website saying: ""Were you having a hard time signing in to Xbox Live? If so, we're glad to say we've reached a solution! You can once again sign in without any issues. Thanks for hanging in there while we worked. We appreciate it!"" 
 
 But many PlayStation users were still having difficulty logging on to their network. 
 
 Gamers were able to play games offline, but couldn't communicate with other players or make use of network functions. 
 
 The hacker group Lizard Squad said earlier it was ""smacking"" the two systems, apparently one of several attacks in December. The group took responsibility for keeping each network down earlier this month on separate occasions. 
 
 On Thursday, the group asked for retweets in exchange for ending the problem, which could be a distributed denial of service attack. 
 
 That's when hackers flood networks with illegitimate traffic, overwhelming the ability of the servers. 
 
 The problem might be exacerbated by video gamers who received new systems for Christmas and were adding to the potential traffic on one of the busiest gaming days of the year. 
 
 The network downtime started just hours after Microsoft's Xbox video store started to stream the Seth Rogen comedy ""The Interview."" The movie was made by Sony Pictures, a sibling of Sony's PlayStation division. 
 
 Sony was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late November that was widely believed to be motivated, at least in part, by North Korea's anger over ""The Interview,"" which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong Un. 
 
 But there was no indication that Thursday's problems were in any way connected to the movie's digital release. Other participating distributors of the movie, such as YouTube, were unaffected. And PlayStation is not participating in the release. 
 
 A Sony Pictures spokesman deferred to PlayStation for comment about the outage.","– Thousands of people who got new Xboxes or PlayStations for Christmas were left frustrated yesterday as both networks suffered major disruptions. The problems began Christmas Eve and persisted through the next day, with Microsoft and Sony telling users they were aware of the issues and were doing their best to get them fixed, the BBC reports. Some suspected the problems may have been linked to Sony's release of The Interview, but a hacking group calling itself the Lizard Squad has claimed responsibility, reports TechCrunch. The same group said it took down gaming networks in August following tweets denouncing the bombing of ISIS targets. The group, which also took responsibility for bringing Xbox and PlayStation networks down earlier this month, asked for retweets of its messages yesterday in return for ending the problem, CNN reports. The problems may have been made worse by the number of people with new devices or games trying to hook up to networks, or possibly even by Sony's decision to release The Interview on Xbox Video as well as other sources, the Guardian reports.",<pad> Xbox Live and PlayStation consoles are back online after a hacking attack on the PlayStation network.</s>,0.1007194223135449,0.021052629949584612,0.0863309331049118
159,"Phyllis Schlafly, whose grass-roots campaigns against Communism, abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment galvanized conservatives for almost two generations and helped reshape American politics, died on Monday. She was 92. 
 
 Her death was confirmed by the Eagle Forum, the conservative organization she founded in 1975. 
 
 In her time, Mrs. Schlafly was one of the most polarizing figures in American public life, a self-described housewife who displayed a moral ferocity reminiscent of the ax-wielding prohibitionist Carry Nation. Richard Viguerie, who masterminded the use of direct mail to finance right-wing causes, called her “the first lady of the conservative movement.” 
 
 On the left, Betty Friedan, the feminist leader and author, compared her to a religious heretic, telling her in a debate that she should burn at the stake for opposing the Equal Rights Amendment. Ms. Friedan called Mrs. Schlafly an “Aunt Tom.” 
 
 Mrs. Schlafly became a forceful conservative voice in the 1950s, when she joined the right-wing crusade against international Communism. In the 1960s, with her popular self-published book “A Choice Not an Echo” (it sold more than three million copies) and a growing legion of followers, she gave critical support to the presidential ambitions of Senator Barry Goldwater, the hard-right Arizonan who went on to lead the Republican Party to electoral disaster in 1964, but who planted the seeds of a conservative revival that would flower with the rise of Ronald Reagan. ||||| ""I had six children,"" she said in 2008, when she backed John McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as a running mate. ""I ran for Congress. An organized mother puts it all together. The time-management mother uses the older ones to help with the younger ones. You should read that old book 'Cheaper by the Dozen.'"" ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Phyllis Schlafly, who became a “founding mother” of the modern U.S. conservative movement by battling feminists in the 1970s and working tirelessly to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, died on Monday at the age of 92, her Eagle Forum group said. 
 
 Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly introduces U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at the Peabody Opera House in St. Louis, Missouri, March 11, 2016. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein - RTSAF6Q 
 
 Schlafly, who lived in the St. Louis suburb of Ladue, Missouri, died at her home in the presence of her family, Eagle Forum said in a statement. The cause of death was not given. 
 
 She was still a conservative force and popular speaker in her 90s, endorsing Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and praising his policy on immigration. She was a delegate to the Republicans’ convention in Cleveland. 
 
 Trump said in a statement that he spoke with Schlafly a few weeks ago by telephone “and she sounded as resilient as ever ... She was a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength.” 
 
 Schlafly once called feminists “a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems,” Time said, while insisting that “women find their greatest fulfillment at home with their family.” 
 
 Her political ardor did not fade with age and in 2014, as President Barack Obama pushed for pay equity for women, Schlafly sparked controversy with a column for the Christian Post saying a man’s paycheck comes first. 
 
 “The pay gap between men and women is not all bad because it helps to promote and sustain marriages,” she said. “... The best way to improve economic prospects for women is to improve job prospects for the men in their lives, even if that means increasing the so-called pay gap.” 
 
 Schlafly promoted traditional family values and once told a reporter that she always listed her occupation as “mother” when filling out applications. But she was hardly a typical stay-at-home housewife/mother. 
 
 Shortly after marrying lawyer Fred Schlafly in 1949, she became active in Republican Party politics in Alton, Illinois, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice. She would go on to found the Eagle Forum grass-roots conservative group, write a newspaper column and newsletter and author some 20 books. 
 
 Her crowning achievement was crusading to prevent the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the U.S. Constitution and it made Schlafly a leader in the modern American conservative movement. 
 
 “Phyllis Schlafly courageously and single-handedly took on the issue of the Equal Rights Amendment when no one else in the country was opposing it,” said James C. Dobson, chairman and founder of Focus on the Family. “In so doing, she essentially launched the pro-family, pro-life movement.” 
 
 Biographer Donald T. Critchlow said defeating the ERA helped usher in a conservative era in American politics and boosted Ronald Reagan to the presidency. 
 
 In her decade-long fight against the ERA, Schlafly traveled across the country to speak at rallies and persuade state legislators not to approve the ERA. 
 
 Along the way she often debated feminist writer Betty Freidan, who called Schlafly “a traitor to her sex” and once told her: “I’d like to burn you at the stake.” 
 
 The intention of the ERA was to ensure women were treated the same as men under state and federal laws. Schlafly’s attack on the proposed amendment was based on the premise that the rights of women already were well protected by the U.S. Constitution. She said the ERA actually would erode women’s standing, leading to homosexual marriages, women in combat, government-funded abortions and loss of alimony. 
 
 In 1972 she started the Eagle Forum, now located in Clayton, Missouri, along with Stop ERA, bringing in legions of supporters who had been regarded as non-political housewives. In a 1978 appearance at the Illinois capitol she was accompanied by backers bearing loaves of home-made bread. 
 
 Described by Time magazine as “feminine but forceful” and with her hair always carefully styled, Schlafly said she attended 41 state hearings to testify against the Equal Rights Amendment. When the ERA’s ratification deadline expired in 1982, having been approved by only 35 of the 38 states needed, Schlafly threw a party in Washington. 
 
 Phyllis Stewart was born Aug. 15, 1924, in St. Louis and grew up in a home she described as Republican but not activist. She put herself through Washington University by firing weapons as an ammunition factory tester and later earned a master’s degree in political science from Radcliffe. In 1978 she graduated from Washington University’s law school. 
 
 The left attacked Schlafly for promoting domestic life to her supporters while spending so much time pursuing her ambitious political agenda. She responded by saying she never told women they should not work. 
 
 “I simply didn’t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women’s rights,” Schlafly told the New York Times. 
 
 Schlafly first became a political presence with her 1964 self-published book “A Choice, Not an Echo,” which championed the conservative politics of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater. 
 
 Schlafly also built a reputation as a strident anti-Communist and opponent of arms control treaties. After the ERA’s defeat, she continued to preach conservative causes such as limited government, anti-abortion laws, traditional education, strong defense and keeping out illegal immigrants.

 She frequently criticized immigration reform and the Obama administration and wrote more than 25 books. 
 
 Schlafly also was a critic of gay rights, which proved to be a sensitive topic in 1992 when the oldest of her six children, John, who worked for the Eagle Forum, acknowledged he was homosexual. 
 
 Schlafly’s husband Fred died in 1993. She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, Eagle Forum said.","– Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, best known for her successful campaign to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, has died at her home in St. Louis. She was 92. The author and activist attended scores of hearings in the 1970s to testify against the amendment, arguing that equal rights would disadvantage housewives. She threw a party when it expired in 1982, having been passed by both houses of Congress but only ratified by 35 of the necessary 38 states, reports Reuters. Schlafly—who worked at a munitions factory in World War II—earned a master's degree in political science and a law degree, unsuccessfully ran for Congress three times and founded the Eagle Forum conservative group while raising six children and presenting herself as a traditional housewife, the New York Times reports. When she spoke at gatherings nationwide, Schlafly loved to mock what she called ""women's libbers"" by saying: ""I'd like to thank my husband, Fred, for letting me be here today."" Historians say the ERA might have passed if it wasn't for Schlafly, who mobilized anti-feminist volunteers across the country and warned that the amendment could lead to gay marriage, women in combat, and unisex restrooms, the Los Angeles Times notes. She remained active in her later years and endorsed Donald Trump in March this year, saying: ""We've been following the losers for so long,"" but ""now we've got a guy who will lead us to victory.""

 “Michael G. Wilson, Barbara Broccoli, and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences, Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25,” the 007 Twitter account posted on Tuesday.

 MGM is releasing domestically through their joint venture with Annapurna Pictures and had dated the film for Nov. 8, 2019, with Universal handling international rights. It is unknown whether Boyle’s exit will have any effect on the release date or production, which was expected to begin in December. Universal was set to release the film in the U.K. on Oct 25, 2019. 
 
 Sources tell Variety that Eon and Boyle were in the early stages of casting the new Bond girl and villain prior to the December production start. Producers will now act quickly to find Boyle’s replacement. 
 
 Prior to Boyle’s hiring, David Mackenzie, Denis Villeneuve, and “White Boy Rick” helmer Yann Demange were in contention for the job. 
 
 Variety first reported that Boyle was high on MGM’s list to direct the pic. He had long been in MGM and Eon’s sights to board a James Bond movie, dating back to 2012’s “Skyfall” and 2015’s “Spectre.” 
 
 Sam Mendes directed the previous two installments, which became the highest-grossing movies in the series, with “Skyfall” hauling $1.1 billion globally and “Spectre” earning $880.7 million at the worldwide box office. Mendes said after the most recent Bond movie, he would not continue directing films in the 007 series. 
 
 RELATED VIDEO: ||||| Danny Boyle will no longer be leading 007 on his next mission. The producers of the James Bond franchise and star Daniel Craig made the announcement Tuesday that Boyle was exiting the project, which he had been set to direct. 
 
 ""Michael G. Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25,"" the official James Bond Twitter account tweeted. 
 
 Boyle revealed in March that he was eyeing the next Bond film, which he was set to tackle after directing an untitled comedy starring Lily James and Kate McKinnon, which opens in September 2019. The filmmaker is a longtime 007 fan, and included Craig’s Bond in the opening of the 2012 London Olympics, which Boyle directed. Boyle's Trainspotting collaborator John Hodge was writing a script for the next Bond pic based on an idea from the helmer. A previous draft was written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who penned Craig's Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre. 
 
 The director shake-up comes as developments in the Bond franchise continue to capture the public's attention. The next Bond is expected to be Craig's last as the secret agent, and speculation about who could replace him after Bond 25 sets the internet ablaze on a semi-regular basis. Upon being tapped as director, Boyle was seen by some as a natural choice, due to his Oscar pedigree as the filmmaker behind Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. But it was also viewed as a surprise, given that the filmmaker, who had avoided franchises in the past, would board the Bond machine after crafting idiosyncratic genre films such as 28 Days Later and Sunshine. 
 
 Production on the next James Bond film is currently set to begin in December for a U.S. release date of Nov. 8, 2019. It is scheduled to hit the U.K. on Oct. 25, 2019. Universal is distributing the film internationally, while MGM, which is making the movie with Eon Productions, is handling domestic rights. 
 
 Sam Mendes directed the previous two installments of the James Bond series, with 2012's Skyfall earning a franchise best $1.1 billion and 2015's Spectre bringing in $880 million.","– Danny Boyle's tenure as a Bond director ended up being short-lived. The 007 Twitter account on Tuesday announced that ""Michael G.

Variety reports MGM had long wanted Boyle to helm a Bond flick; he was selected to fill the shoes emptied by Sam Mendes, who directed 2012's Skyfall and Spectre, which was out three years later.

162,"Photography giant Polaroid plans to open at least ten new retail stores this year focused on getting people to print and edit the photos saved on their smartphone, or uploaded to social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Picasa. 
 
 The first ‘Polaroid Fotobar’ store, which is set to open in Florida next month, will allow in-store customers to wirelessly transmit the images stored on their smartphone or tablet to a bar-top workstation. From here, the photos can be edited to fix red-eye or alter the contrast and brightness. A number of filters will also be available, presumably to help users get that vintage, “analogue feel” if they haven’t done so already using an app such as Snapseed or Instagram.

 Photos can also be uploaded from social platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Picasa and “several others”. Although the latter haven’t been revealed by Polaroid yet, we’ve got our fingers crossed for Flickr, Google+ and 500px. 
 
 Once the images have been chosen, users can then have the image printed in a number of different materials and substrates including metal, wood and bamboo, as well as choose from various framing options. 
 
 The idea is to make the digital and often forgettable images stored on your smartphone feel like works of art again; something which you would want to share with friends or hang in your house or office. 
 
 Polaroid CEO and president Scott W. Hardy said: 
 
 “Polaroid is about sharing life’s most precious and memorable moments. We have been, and continue to be, about self-expression, creativity and fun. Polaroid Fotobar retail stores represent a perfect modern expression of the values for which we have stood for 75 years.” 
 
 Polaroid promises that any ordered prints will be handcrafted and shipped from their manufacturing facility within 72 hours. The store itself will also have a photo gallery of “creative, museum-quality pieces” designed to inspire customers and make them feel like they’re in a real photography studio. 
 
 Future Polaroid Fotobar locations include New York, Las Vegas and Boston. The first store on Delray Beach, Florida will also have a multi-purpose room called “The Studio”, which can be used to host classes, private parties and a studio for portrait work. On the shopfront, Polaroid will also have some experienced “Phototenders” to help consumers through the entire ordering process. 
 
 It’s an interesting time for Polaroid. While the company’s reputation for instant printing is less prevalent these days, the resurgence of analogue photography – or perhaps more specifically, the analogue aesthetic – has brought them back into relevance. 
 
 They also hit the headlines back in May last year when a subsidiary of Acacia Research Corporation, a renowned patent troll, acquired patents covering digital imaging and other related technologies that were originally issued to Polaroid.

The first store will open during February in Delray Beach, Florida, with at least nine more to follow in New York, Boston, Las Vegas, and elsewhere. 
 
 Fotobar opened as an online-only store in October, printing photos from phones or social services like Instagram and offering editing tools and filters.

Johnson City Police are now conducting an investigation into whether management could have prevented their deaths.After hearing the news, the village mayor told NewsChannel 9 he wanted police to investigate.Johnson City Mayor Dennis Hannon said, “If someone was aware that those animals were in danger and didn't take the appropriate action to remove them to safety then that is a crime under NYS Law.”Mayor Hannon said part of the investigation will include looking into claims that some employees wanted to bring the animals home because of the impending flood, but were told “no” by management. Johnson City was put under a State of Emergency before the water levels got too high, giving -- what the mayor calls -- ample time for the company employees to react. If charges are filed, the mayor says they’ll most likely be against the management at the store.“I’m personally reviewing the events that took place in our Johnson City store and all of us at Petco feel terrible that this tragedy occurred. We are truly saddened by what has happened, and accept full responsibility. We are working hard to do our best for the animals in our care and are studying the events surrounding this occurrence to ensure we take timely and appropriate steps to ensure that nothing like this can happen again. We fully appreciate the outpouring of concern from the members of the Johnson City community and look forward to serving you better in the future.”The company has received a lot of backlash for its actions.

The mayor expects the investigation to take up to 30 days. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has also learned of the tragedy and is urging an investigation. ||||| Flooding from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee has left a lot of Northeastern residents underwater. From Maine to New Jersey, you can't go a day without reading a story about flood damage. They're all sad, but this one, this one today was just plain horrible ... if not horrifying. A Petco store in Johnson City, New York was evacuated then beset by flood waters. When employees returned to the store for the first time on Friday, they found not only wet floors, but 100 dead animals. From hamsters to birds, little pets perished by either drowning or starving -- the cause of death has yet to be confirmed. 
 
 The saddest part is that these deaths could have been prevented. 
 
 Had the manager or store officials been a little extra-cautious, perhaps they would have evacuated the whole store, not just the employees and a ""majority"" of the pets. The ones who weren't cleared out suffered a cruel and unusual fate. Petco's CEO says that the fact that store was new, and had never been through a flood before, was the reason they misjudged the risk of their location. 
 
 If the flooding began on Wednesday, and schools in the area were closing early due to the rising waters, why didn't an employee or Petco manager think to check on the store? Listen, I know what it's like to be sick of the weather hype. As a New Yorker who ""survived"" Irene, I was a little frustrated by the overly-cautious preventions the city took. That said, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Which is why I'm surprised Petco, who's responsible for the lives of hundreds of animals, didn't react sooner. When lives are at stake, you have to over-react and over-prepare. Plan for the worst, hope for the best, enjoy bitching about preparing for the worst when everything turns out for the best -- that's how the saying goes, doesn't it? 
 
 Animal lovers are rightfully outraged by the incident -- there's been a Facebook page set up calling for the boycott of Petco, and PETA's now involved. While I'm not necessarily a fan of PETA, I am a fan of keeping animals safe. There must have been a lot of people in town who would have gladly adopted the pets for the flood's duration, or a volunteer or two to make sure they stayed fed in the store (if in fact they didn't drown). 
 
 There's no info on whether or not the pet fish in the store were super psyched about the flood, but clearly no one else is happy about it. 
 
 Do you think Petco should be boycotted?

 The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, according to government data released Friday morning, surpassing economists' expectations and suggesting the economy continues to thrive after an extended streak of job gains in recent years. 
 
 The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in June, and wages rose by 2.5 percent from the year before to $26.36 in July. 
 
 “It was pretty solid across the board,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JP Morgan. “It suggests there is really no slowing in the momentum of the labor market.” 
 
 [How healthy is Trump’s economy?] 
 
 President Trump greeted the report as evidence of his administration's success, tweeting Friday morning, “Excellent Jobs Numbers just released — and I have only just begun.” 
 
 Yet average monthly jobs gains this year, which are now at 184,000, are basically in line with the average monthly gains of 187,000 in 2016. 
 
 “We’re looking at job growth that was pretty similar to what we were getting a year ago or two years ago. I just don’t think at a business cycle frequency these things respond to political developments,” Feroli said. 
 
 The U.S. labor market has made strong and steady gains in recent months, even as this period of economic expansion has stretched into the third longest in history. That has driven U.S. stock markets to record highs, with the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closing above 22,000 Wednesday for the first time in history. The Dow opened at 22,058.39 Friday morning, before retreating slightly by mid-day. 
 
 July’s additions also signify a notable turning point for the U.S. economy: After accounting for shifts in population, the level of employment has returned to what it was at in November 2007, before the recession decimated the job market, according to research published Friday morning by the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton project. 
 
 “It does not mean there’s no slack in the economy, [or] that we’re at full employment. But it does mean the job losses from the Great Recession are behind us,” said Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, one of the report’s authors. 
 
 Job gains were broadly spread across many sectors, with health care, restaurants and office jobs recording the strongest increases. 
 
 Low-wage industries like leisure and hospitality grew the fastest in July, a development which may help lower-income Americans get back to work, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at jobs site Indeed. Yet manufacturing hit a new low in July as a share of all U.S. jobs, said Kolko. While manufacturing has been a focus of the Trump administration, the sector continues to shed jobs, due largely to automation. 
 
 Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected 180,000 jobs to be added in the month, in line with average monthly gains for the first six months of the year. Government statisticians revised their estimates for May and June, in total adding 2,000 jobs to the rolls. 
 
 America's monthly jobs report can be hard to understand. Here's what you need to know about non-farm payroll employment and the unemployment rate—with gummy bears to help explain. (Kate M. Tobey,Gillian Brockell,Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) 
 
 The labor force swelled as more Americans found work. The labor force participation rate, the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work, ticked up to 62.9 percent after dipping in previous months. 
 
 The jobs data is gathered from two separate surveys, one of employers and the other of households. It will be revised twice in subsequent months, sometimes significantly. 
 
 The economy's strength has encouraged the Federal Reserve to continue to gradually raise interest rates to more normal levels, after years of keeping lending easy to stimulate the economy. 
 
 Yet wage growth remains somewhat tepid, a sign that the economy may have farther to go before reaching the point where further expansion merely results in inflationary pressures. As the unemployment rate falls, business owners have to compete more to hire qualified workers, forcing them to raise wages and adding to inflation. 
 
 In a call on Thursday to state their support for Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and urge Trump to reappoint her when her term expires early next year, members of a coalition called Fed Up argued that the economy’s recovery is not yet complete and that the Fed should maintain low interest rates to allow workers, especially lower-income communities of color, to recover from the financial crisis. 
 
 “We still don’t look like an economy that should still be raising interest rates, and we absolutely should not be raising interest rates in an autopilot kind of way,” said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. 
 
 Futures contracts indicate most investors expect the central bank to hold interest rates steady when it meets in September, instead focusing on a plan to reduce its massive balance sheet. But those contracts put the odds of a rate hike in December at over 40 percent. 
 
 Investors should bet on more rate hikes this year, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in an email to clients Thursday. “Inflation is coming and the Fed has to push interest rates back to normal levels before inflation gets there.”

 'Nato allies at each other's throats' 
 
 Image copyright Reuters Image caption Presidents Trump and Erdogan met at a Nato summit in Brussels last month 
 
 By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent 
 
 It is unprecedented for the US to hit a Nato ally with sanctions. The relationship has plunged to its lowest level in decades. 
 
 But it is remarkable to think that in 2016, Turkey's government was gunning for a Donald Trump victory. Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's disgraced former national security advisor, was paid to lobby for Turkey in Washington. There was confidence that presidents Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdogan could form a strongman partnership to reset ties. 
 
 President Erdogan is known for lashing out at Western leaders. He hasn't taken kindly to being the one browbeaten by the US. 
 
 Pro-government columnists are calling for the US military base here to be shut down. A crucial security partnership is at risk with two Nato allies at each other's throats. 
 
 Meanwhile, Turks are suffering as the lira reaches new lows. Erdogan critics say he should have been sanctioned long ago - over mass arrests, human rights violations and buying a missile defence system from Russia. But now sanctions have come, the fear is of what two unpredictable leaders will do next. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, Sarah Sanders said: ""We've seen no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong."" 
 
 She added that the two Turkish ministers had both played ""leading roles"" in the arrest of the US pastor. 
 
 ""As a result, any property or interest in property of both ministers within US jurisdiction is blocked and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,"" she said. 
 
 Ms Sanders also said that President Trump had discussed the matter with President Erdogan ""multiple times"". 
 
 Last week, President Trump warned Turkey it would face ""large sanctions"" if it did not release Mr Brunson immediately. 
 
 Following Wednesday's announcement, the Turkish lira lost 1.6% of its value to fall to 5.0 against the US dollar. 
 
 Who is Andrew Brunson? 
 
 Mr Brunson is a long-term resident in Turkey. He lived with his wife and three children while working as the pastor of the small Izmir Resurrection Church, which had a congregation of about two dozen. 
 
 The authorities accuse him of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a 2016 failed coup. 
 
 Image copyright Reuters Image caption Turkey has urged the US to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen 
 
 Mr Brunson has denied charges of espionage, but faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty. 
 
 He was moved into house arrest last month for health reasons, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this was not enough. 
 
 ""We have seen no credible evidence against Mr Brunson,"" Mr Pompeo tweeted at the time. 
 
 Turkey's foreign ministry said it had shared ""necessary information"" with the US, but insisted the case should be left with its judiciary. 
 
 What is Turkey's motivation? 
 
 Mr Brunson is one of 20 Americans who were charged after the coup two years ago, according to the New York Times. 
 
 More than 50,000 people were arrested in Turkey in President Erdogan's huge post-coup crackdown. 
 
 He blames Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the attempt, but Mr Gulen denies any involvement. 
 
 Turkey wants the US to agree to his extradition. Mr Erdogan has indicated he would swap the pastor for ""the priest"" (Mr Gulen). 
 
 US support for Kurdish forces fighting the Syrian civil war has also angered Mr Erdogan, who views them as an extension of the PKK.

 Updated at 5:45 p.m. ET 
 
 The U.S. is imposing sanctions against two high-level Turkish officials, retaliating for what the Treasury Department calls the ""unfair and unjust detention"" of an American pastor in Izmir. The penalties announced Wednesday, which aim to punish the chiefs of Turkey's ministries of justice and the interior, mark a significant escalation in the recent frictions between the two key NATO allies. 
 
 But they are not altogether unexpected: Both President Trump and Vice President Pence have both lately threatened retaliation over the status of Andrew Brunson, whom Turkish authorities detained in October 2016. He has been charged with engaging in espionage and aiding terrorist groups. 
 
 The 50-year-old evangelical Presbyterian minister, who hails from North Carolina but has spent more than two decades in Turkey, was swept up in Ankara's wide-ranging crackdown after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Now under house arrest, Brunson faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted of all charges. 
 
 And on Wednesday the Treasury Department laid blame for his ongoing trial primarily with Abdulhamit Gul, Turkey's justice minister, and Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The sanctions against them prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with both men and block any of their property that rests within American jurisdiction. 
 
 ""Pastor Brunson's unjust detention and continued prosecution by Turkish officials is simply unacceptable,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. ""President Trump has made it abundantly clear that the United States expects Turkey to release him immediately."" 
 
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also discussed the matter several times with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, according to State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert. And during a press briefing Tuesday, she noted that Brunson is not the only detained individual they're seeking to get released: She says the State Department has also been advocating on behalf of several locally hired personnel who were also swept up in the arrests after the attempted coup. 
 
 ""Turkey knows our position well,"" she said Wednesday. ""This has gone on far too long."" 
 
 The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs promised Wednesday to retaliate with ""an equivalent response"" if the U.S. does not walk back ""this wrong decision."" 
 
 ""There is no doubt that the decision, which disrespectfully intervenes with our judicial system, stands in contrast to the essence of our relations and will seriously damage the constructive efforts made in order to resolve problems between the two countries,"" the ministry added. 
 
 In a tweet translated by the state-run Anadolu news agency, Cavusoglu also vowed that the ""US attempt to impose sanctions on our two ministers will not go unanswered."" 
 
 Faced with pressure from U.S. officials last year, Erdogan suggested Brunson's release may depend on U.S. compliance with one of his own demands: the extradition of elderly Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan has repeatedly accused of organizing the 2016 coup from his compound in Pennsylvania, despite Gulen's denials. 
 
 """"You have a pastor too,"" Erdogan said then. ""You give us that one and we'll work with our judiciary and give back yours."" 
 
 U.S. officials, for their part, show no inclination to accede to their NATO ally's demand, either. And they have had lawmakers' bipartisan backing in the campaign to obtain Brunson's release. 
 
 ""Our fellow citizens aren't bargaining chips,"" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement applauding the sanctions Wednesday. ""Pastor Brunson is an innocent man. Turkey's charges are completely unjust and these new sanctions are absolutely warranted. President Erdogan ought to know that the United States expects more from a member of NATO. Free Pastor Brunson now.""","– President Trump has made good on his threat to hit Turkey with sanctions if American pastor Andrew Brunson wasn't freed. The country's justice minister and interior minister, Abdulhamit Gul and Suleyman Soylu, have been sanctioned over what White House press secretary Sarah Sanders describes as the ""unfair and unjust detention"" of the North Carolina pastor and longtime Turkey resident, who was jailed for around two years before being shifted to house arrest last month, the BBC reports. Brunson was charged with espionage and aiding terrorist groups in the 2016 crackdown that followed a failed coup and faces up to 35 years if convicted on all counts. Sanders said that the sanctions on the NATO ally came after Trump discussed the matter with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""many times."" Turkish officials vowed that the sanctions, which ban American companies and individuals from doing business with the men, would not go unanswered, NPR reports. Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the move ""disrespectfully intervenes with our judicial system, stands in contrast to the essence of our relations, and will seriously damage the constructive efforts made in order to resolve problems between the two countries.""

 Balenga Kalala, who arrived in Australia in 2004 as a refugee, paid almost $7,000 to a group of kidnappers to kill the mother of his three children, Noela Rukundo, when she was attending her stepmother's funeral in Burundi in early 2015. 
 
 The group snatched Ms Rukundo at gunpoint outside her hotel in Bujumbura in February and drove her to a secret location. 
 
 They told her her partner had paid for her to be murdered, but because they did not want to kill a woman, and they knew Ms Rukundo's brother, they would not carry out the killing. 
 
 They gave Ms Rukundo recorded telephone conversations between them and Kalala planning the hit, as well as receipts from Western Union showing proof of Kalala's payment. 
 
 While Ms Rukundo was in Burundi, Kalala, of Kings Park, was at home looking after the couple's three children and his partner's five children from a previous relationship. 
 
 Believing the murder plot had been executed, he told friends that his wife had been killed in a tragic accident while she was in Africa. 
 
 The African community gathered round the family, providing spiritual and financial support. 
 
 But Ms Rukundo was very much alive. 
 
 She arrived back in Melbourne on February 22 and confronted Kalala at their Kings Park home and called the police. 
 
 In September, Kalala pleaded guilty to one count of incitement to murder. 
 
 Kalala 'motivated by unfounded jealousy' 
 
 In sentencing, Chief Justice Marilyn Warren said the crime involved a great breach of trust. 
 
 ""Had Ms Rukundo's kidnappers completed the job, eight children would have lost their mother,"" she said. 
 
 ""It was premeditated and motivated by unfounded jealousy, anger and a desire to punish Ms Rukundo."" 
 
 She said people should expect protection from the partners, not violence. 
 
 Chief Justice Warren said Kalala had been a hard worker and of good standing in the Australian community prior to this charge. 
 
 She also took into account his troubled childhood in war-torn Africa, and the fact his wife and child had been brutally murdered in the Democratic Republic of Congo when he was aged 24. 
 
 Outside court, Ms Rukundo's son Fostin said his mother still lived in fear. 
 
 Fostin said he was upset by the kidnapping. 
 
 ""She works for us, she feeds us, she clothed us and she was doing the same thing for [Kalala]... 
 
 ""I looked at him (in court) but I couldn't see a man. Because I believe a man would not do something like that."" 
 
 Kalala will be eligible for parole after serving six years' jail.

 Updated 
 
 A Melbourne woman says she has forgiven her husband after he had her kidnapped at gunpoint in Africa and tried to have her killed, but has come under attack from her community for going to police. 
 
 Balenga Kalala, 39, was sentenced to nine years jail for ordering the hit on his wife Noela Rukundo, when she was visiting Burundi for her step-mother's funeral in February. 
 
 The court heard Balenga wanted his wife dead because he suspected she was cheating on him. 
 
 Ms Rukundo, who arrived in Australia as a refugee in 2004, told the ABC she was heartbroken her husband had turned on her. 
 
 ""I can't believe this is happening to me because this is the man I lived with for ten years, and I do everything for him to make this marriage work,"" Ms Rukundo said. 
 
 ""I'm feeling stressed, and depressed. I'm feeling very bad."" 
 
 The court heard Congolese-born Kalala paid almost $7,000 to a group of kidnappers to kill Ms Rukundo. 
 
 The group snatched Ms Rukundo at gunpoint outside her hotel in Bujumbura in February. 
 
 ""A man, when he come close to me [I see] he have a gun,"" she said, recounting the ordeal. 
 
 ""He pointed it at me and then he said 'see that car there? Go slowly by yourself and enter the car'."" 
 
 She was blindfolded and driven to a secret location. 
 
 ""I hear the men and they said 'you woman, what did you do for this man to pay us to kill you?' ""I said, 'What are you talking about?' 
 
 ""The boss says 'Balenga sent us to kill you'. I say 'You lie. My husband can't send anyone to kill me.' They laughed and said 'You're a fool, you're stupid'."" 
 
 To prove that her husband was indeed the person behind the plot, the kidnappers rang him on speaker phone. 
 
 Ms Rukundo said she heard her husband order for her to be killed. 
 
 ""I fainted because I heard his voice,"" she said through tears. 
 
 Kidnappers refused to kill women, children 
 
 The kidnappers told Ms Rukundo they would not kill her because they did not want to kill women or children. 
 
 But they would keep her husband's money, and tell him that she was dead. 
 
 She was held for two days and then released. 
 
 She flew back to Melbourne a few days later where she confronted her husband, who had already been telling members of the African community his wife had been killed in a tragic accident. 
 
 ""He came to me, he touched me. Are you still alive? I just look at him and said 'Surprise! I'm still alive'."" 
 
 He apologised to her and begged for forgiveness but she rang police. 
 
 Local community 'angry' wife went to police 
 
 Ms Rukundo said many people from within the Congolese community were angry with her for informing police about Kalala's offending. 
 
 She said she had received threatening messages and her home has been targeted. 
 
 ""I come home and the back door broken, the front doors broken,"" she said. 
 
 ""I don't know exactly who is behind [it] and what it is they want from me."" 
 
 She has asked the Department of Human Services to find her and her children new accommodation because she does not feel safe. 
 
 Remarkably, after all she has been through, Ms Rukundo said she did not judge her husband. 
 
 ""He's a human being. From my heart, I forgive him,"" she said. 
 
 ""Let God judge him."" 
 
 Balenga Kalala will be eligible for parole after serving six years' jail.

 One year ago a group of gunmen in Burundi was hired to kill a woman visiting from Australia. But the hit did not go as planned, leaving her with a chance to turn the tables on the man who wanted her dead. 
 
 ""I felt like somebody who had risen again,"" says Noela Rukundo. 
 
 She was supposed to be dead. The hired killers had been paid. They had even explained how they would dispose of the body. 
 
 But now, waiting outside her house for the last of the mourners to leave, she was ready to face down the man who had put out a contract for her murder. 
 
 ""When I get out of the car, he saw me straight away. He put his hands on his head and said, 'Is it my eyes? Is it a ghost?'"" 
 
 ""Surprise! I'm still alive!"" she replied. 
 
 Noela's ordeal began five days earlier, and 7,500 miles away in her native Burundi. She had returned to Africa from her home in Melbourne, Australia, to attend her stepmother's funeral.

 ""I had lost the last person who I call 'mother',"" she says. ""It was very painful. I was so stressed."" 
 
 By early evening Noela had retreated to her hotel room. As she lay dozing in the stifling city heat of Bujumbura, her phone rang. It was a call from Australia - from Balenga Kalala, her husband and father to her three youngest children. 
 
 ""He says he'd been trying to get me for the whole day,"" Noela says. ""I said I was going to bed. He told me, 'To bed? Why are you sleeping so early?' 
 
 ""I say, 'I'm not feeling happy'. And he asks me, 'How's the weather? Is it very, very hot?' He told me to go outside for fresh air."" 
 
 Noela took his advice. 
 
 ""I didn't think anything. I just thought that he cared about me, that he was worried about me."" 
 
 But moments after stepping outside the hotel compound, Noela found herself in danger. 
 
 ""I opened the gate and I saw a man coming towards me. Then he pointed the gun on me. 
 
 ""He just told me, 'Don't scream. If you start screaming, I will shoot you. They're going to catch me, but you? You will already be dead.' 
 
 ""So, I did exactly what he told me."" 
 
 The gunman motioned Noela towards a waiting car. 
 
 ""I was sitting between two men. One had a small gun, one had a long gun. And the men say to the driver, 'Pass us a scarf.' Then they cover my face. 
 
 ""After that, I didn't say anything. They just said to the driver, 'Let's go.' 
 
 ""I was taken somewhere, 30 to 40 minutes, then I hear the car stop."" 
 
 Noela was pushed inside a building and tied to a chair. 
 
 ""One of the kidnappers told his friend, 'Go call the boss.' I can hear doors open but I didn't know if their boss was in a room or if he came from outside. 
 
 ""They ask me, 'What did you do to this man? Why has this man asked us to kill you?' And then I tell them, 'Which man? Because I don't have any problem with anybody.' They say, 'Your husband!' I say, 'My husband can't kill me, you are lying!' And then they slap me. 
 
 ""After that the boss says, 'You are very stupid, you are fool. Let me call who has paid us to kill you.'"" 
 
 The gang's leader made the call. 
 
 ""We already have her,"" he triumphantly told his paymaster. 
 
 The phone was put on loudspeaker for Noela to hear the reply. 
 
 Her husband's voice said: ""Kill her."" 
 
 Just hours earlier, the same voice had consoled her over the death of her stepmother and urged her to take fresh air outside the hotel. Now her husband Balenga Kalala had condemned her to death. 
 
 ""I heard his voice. I heard him. I felt like my head was going to blow up. 
 
 ""Then they described for him where they were going to chuck the body."" 
 
 At that, Noela says she passed out.

 Born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Balenga Kalala had arrived in Australia in 2004 as a refugee, after fleeing a rebel army that had rampaged through his village, killing his wife and young son. 
 
 Settling in Melbourne, he soon found steady employment, first in a seafood processing factory and then in a warehouse as a forklift operator. 
 
 ""He could already speak English,"" recalls Noela, who also arrived in Australia in 2004. ""My social worker was his social worker, and they used him to translate Swahili."" 
 
 The two fell in love. They set up home in the Kings Park suburb of the city. Noela had five children from a previous relationship and went on to have three more with Kalala. 
 
 ""I knew he was a violent man,"" admits Noela. ""But I didn't believe he can kill me. I loved this man with all my heart! 
 
 ""I give him, beautiful and handsome, two boys and one girl. So I don't know why he choose to kill me.""

 As the gang's leader ended the call to Kalala, Noela was coming round. 
 
 ""I said to myself, I was already dead. Nothing I can do can save me. 
 
 ""But he looks at me and then he says, 'We're not going to kill you. We don't kill women and children.' 
 
 ""He told me I'd been stupid because my husband paid them the deposit in November. And when I went to Africa it was January. He asked me, 'How stupid can you be, from November, you can't see that something is wrong?'"" 
 
 He might have been a hit-man with principles, but the gang's leader still took the opportunity to extort more money from Kalala. He called him back and informed him that the fee for the murder had increased. He wanted a further 3,400 Australian dollars (£1,700) to finish the job. 
 
 Back at the hotel, Noela's brother was getting worried about her disappearance. He called Kalala in Australia to ask for $545 to pay the police to open an investigation - Kalala feigned concern and duly wired the money. 
 
 After two days in captivity, Noela was freed. 
 
 ""'We give you 80 hours to leave this country,'"" Noela says the gang told her. ""'Your husband is serious. Maybe we can spare your life, but other people, they're not going to do the same thing. If God helps you, you'll get to Australia.'"" 
 
 Before leaving Noela by the side of a road, the gang handed her the evidence they hoped would incriminate Kalala - a memory card containing recorded phone conversations of him discussing the murder and receipts for the Western Union money transfers.

 ""We just want you to go back, to tell other stupid women like you what happened,"" the gang told Noela as they parted. ""You must learn something: you people get a chance to go overseas for a better life. But the money you are earning, the money the government gives to you, you use it for killing each other!"" 
 
 Noela immediately began planning her return to Australia. She called the pastor of her church in Melbourne, Dassano Harruno Nantogmah, and requested his help. 
 
 ""'It was in the middle of the night. I says, 'It's me, I'm still alive, don't tell anybody.' He says, 'Noela, I don't believe it. Balenga can't kill someone!' And I said, 'Pastor, believe me!'"" 
 
 His voice always comes to me in the night - 'Kill her, kill her' Noela Rukundo 
 
 Three days later, on the evening of 22 February 2015, Noela was back in Melbourne. 
 
 By now, Kalala had informed the community that his wife had died in a tragic accident. He had spent the day hosting a steady stream of well-wishers, many of whom donated money. 
 
 ""It was around 7.30pm,"" Noela says. ""He was in front of the house. People had been inside mourning with him and he was escorting a group of them into a car."" 
 
 It was as they drove away that Noela sprang her surprise. 
 
 ""I was stood just looking at him. He was scared, he didn't believe it. Then he starts walking towards me, slowly, like he was walking on broken glass. 
 
 ""He kept talking to himself and when he reached me, he touched me on the shoulder. He jumped. 
 
 ""He did it again. He jumped. Then he said, 'Noela, is it you?'… Then he start screaming, 'I'm sorry for everything.'"" 
 
 Noela called the police who ordered Kalala off the premises and later obtained a court order against him. Days later, the police instructed Noela to call Kalala. Kalala made a full confession to his wife, captured on tape, begging for her forgiveness and revealing why he had ordered the murder. 
 
 ""He say he wanted to kill me because he was jealous,"" says Noela. ""He think that I wanted to leave him for another man."" 
 
 She rejects the accusation. 
 
 In a police interview, Kalala denied any involvement in the plot. ""The pretence,"" wrote the judge at his trial in December, ""lasted for hours."" But when confronted with the recording of his telephone conversation with Noela and the evidence she brought back from Burundi he started to cry. 
 
 Kalala was still unable to offer any explanation for his actions, suggesting only that ""sometimes [the] devil can come into someone to do something but after they do it, they start thinking, 'Why I did that thing?'"" 
 
 On 11 December last year, in court in Melbourne, after pleading guilty to incitement to murder, Kalala was sentenced to nine years in prison. 
 
 ""His voice always comes in the night - 'Kill her, kill her,'"" says Noela of the nightmares that now plague her. ""Every night, I see what was happening in those two days with the kidnappers."" 
 
 Ostracised by many in Melbourne's African community, some of whom blame her for Kalala's conviction, Noela sees a difficult future for her and her eight children. 
 
 ""But I will stand up like a strong woman,"" she says. 
 
 ""My situation, my past life? That is gone. I'm starting a new life now.""

 The Congolese forklift operator from Kings Park, who arrived in Australia in 2004 as a refugee, paid almost $7000 to the kidnappers but they eventually freed his de facto and the mother of his three children, Noela Rukundo, because they did not kill women.

 Link Balenga Kalala paid $7000 for his partner to be kidnapped and murdered. 
 
 On her release, the kidnappers gave Ms Rukundo two receipts from Western Union for the $7000 ""blood money"". Kalala had used a redraw facility on the couple's home loan to get the money. 
 
 When Ms Rukundo returned home to Melbourne and confronted her husband in their front yard, he was shocked she was still alive. 
 
 He had been telling friends in his local African community in Melbourne's west how his wife had died in a tragic accident in Burundi, and they had rallied around him to offer significant financial support to help him and the children. 
 
 Ms Rukundo told him, ""Surprise! I'm still alive. You are a wicked man. Why did you want me to be killed? What about your small children (aged five, 10 and 11)? Who was going to look after them?""

 Police were called but Kalala initially denied any wrongdoing. 
 
 Crown prosecutor Douglas Trapnell, QC, told the Supreme Court that police secretly recorded a phone conversation between Kalala and his de facto on February 28, 2015, in which he begged her to forgive him and confirmed he had arranged for her to be murdered. 
 
 He believed she had been having an affair and wanted to punish her for being unfaithful. 
 
 ""Sometimes Devil can come into someone, to do something, but after they do it they start thinking, 'Why I did that thing?', later,"" he told her. 
 
 Outlining the details of the case after Kalala had pleaded guilty to one charge of incitement to murder, Mr Trapnell said Ms Rukundo had flown to Burundi on January 21, 2015, to attend her stepmother's funeral and visit relatives. 
 
 Ms Rukundo was staying at a hotel in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, during her trip and was in regular contact with Kalala. Kalala had stayed at home to look after the couple's three children, as well as Ms Rukundo's five children from previous relationships. 
 
 Kalala called Ms Rukundo at about 8pm local time on February 17 and after talking about the hot weather, he told her to go outside to get some fresh air. 
 
 Ms Rukundo walked outside and was suddenly approached by a man armed with a gun. 
 
 ""This male threatened her with the firearm, told her to remain quiet and forced her into a vehicle,"" the prosecutor said. ""Two other unknown males were in the vehicle. The offenders covered Ms Rukundo's face and drove away."" 
 
 Ms Rukundo was driven to a secret location where a fourth man told her Kalala had paid for her to be killed, but the kidnappers did not wish to kill a woman. 
 
 One of the kidnappers called Kalala on February 18 and told him in Swahili how they had completed the ""big job"" for him. 
 
 The kidnapper told Kalala: ""We've killed your wife and you are the one winning."" 
 
 Kalala expressed his gratitude and said, ""We are like family."" 
 
 Ms Rukundo was released on February 19 and her kidnappers handed her a mobile phone memory card containing the recorded telephone conversations they had had with Kalala over her planned murder and the receipts from her partner's payment. 
 
 After her release, Ms Rukundo sought help from the Kenyan and Belgian embassies to return to Australia and arrived in Melbourne on February 22 before going straight from the airport to confront Kalala. 
 
 Chief Justice Marilyn Warren remanded Kalala for sentencing at a later date.","– Noela Rukundo had been with her husband, Balenga Kalala, for 11 years when, last year, she flew from their home in Melbourne, Australia, to her native Burundi for her stepmother's funeral. While there, Kalala ordered gang members to have her killed. They abducted her and told her what they had been hired to do; Rukundo even heard her husband's voice on speakerphone telling them to kill her, the Australian Broadcasting Company reports. The gang members decided not to murder her because they knew her brother and they didn't believe in killing women, but they kept Kalala's money and told him the job was done. She was able to get back home, where, on Feb. 22, 2015, she walked up to Kalala after her own funeral; he'd told everyone she died while in Burundi. ""Is it a ghost?"" the scared man, who has since been sentenced to nine years for incitement to murder, per the ABC, asked. Rukundo tells the BBC her husband touched her shoulder to make sure she was real, then began screaming. He apologized, but she called police—and, though Kalala first denied he'd had anything to do with Rukundo's ordeal, she ultimately got him to confess while police secretly recorded one of their phone calls, the Age reports. His explanation to her? He thought she was going to leave him for someone else. ""Sometimes Devil can come into someone, to do something, but after they do it they start thinking, ‘Why I did that thing?’ later,"" he reportedly said.

 Molins said the Algerian had made ""farfetched"" comments, claiming that he had become afraid of holding so many weapons and had injured himself when trying to throw them in the river Seine, which flows through Paris.

168,"(CNN) -- The winter storm system that walloped the Midwest moved east Friday night, bringing with it not just snow but powerful winds -- all of which made travel perilous and last-minute Christmas shopping more complicated across several states. 
 
 Earlier this week, blizzard-like conditions left many locales white less than a week before the holiday. Many communities in central Iowa, for instance, got about a foot of snow, and the city of Madison, Wisconsin, got 15.2 inches Wednesday and Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. 
 
 This much snow generally isn't expected as the system moves east, hitting Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. But that doesn't mean there haven't been -- and won't still be -- plenty of headaches. 
 
 Snow is hardly foreign to these areas. But the addition of strong winds, especially in mountainous areas and along the Great Lakes, makes staying on snow-slickened roads even harder. 
 
 ""It's scary,"" Esther Boyer told CNN affiliate WDTN, soon after her car slid into a ditch Friday in western Ohio. ""I guess I was just driving too fast, and you should slow down a lot sooner."" 
 
 The lone blizzard warning, in effect Friday night through 6 p.m. Saturday, was for parts of northern West Virginia and north-central Maryland. The National Weather Service predicts 8 to 12 inches of snow and sustained winds of up to 35 mph, with gusts blowing up to 60 mph. 
 
 ""Strong winds will cause blowing and drifting of snow with blizzard conditions expected at times with visibilities of one quarter mile or less (and) wind chill temperatures in the single digits ... also possible,"" the agency's forecast said. ""Downed trees and power lines could result from the strongest gusts on Saturday."" 
 
 More populated areas -- many of which, such as Buffalo, Cleveland and Erie, Pennsylvania, were seeing snow around 9 p.m. Friday -- are also expected to be hit hard. 
 
 The latter two cities are among those facing a winter storm warning through 7 p.m. Saturday. The weather service's forecast calls for 5 to 7 inches of snow, with 10 inches possible in spots, plus regular winds approaching 30 mph and up to 45-mph gusts by Lake Erie. 
 
 A similar warning applies to western Pennsylvania, where 5 to 9 inches of light to moderate snow -- some of it ""heavier, lake-enhanced snow"" -- and gusts as strong as 40 mph are expected. 
 
 Even more snow, between 10 to 18 inches, is forecast farther south in Pennsylvania and in northern Maryland, with 50-mph gusts possible. 
 
 ""A winter storm warning means that snow will make travel dangerous,"" the weather service said. ""If you must venture out at all, use extreme caution."" 
 
 These advisories follow severe weather farther west that caused major problems earlier this week. 
 
 While the city itself was largely spared of snow, Chicago's two airports -- O'Hare and Midway -- were clogged with travelers due to flight cancellations. 
 
 Blinding snow is blamed for a 30-car pileup on Interstate 35 near Fort Dodge, Iowa, that killed two people, said Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright. It was one of close to 100 weather-related accidents reported around the state by Thursday morning, according to Bright.

 The storm, part of a system that began in the Rockies earlier in the week, led airlines to cancel more than 1,000 flights and caused whiteout conditions that left roads dangerous to drive on. It was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow. 
 
 While some people went to work on digging themselves out even as the storm continued Thursday, others had less control: They were stuck waiting for word of new flight times. 
 
 Most of the canceled flights were in Chicago, where aviation officials said more than 350 flights were called off at O'Hare International Airport and more than 150 at Midway International Airport. 
 
 Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. 
 
 Erin Henderson is among the people hoping to get out of O'Hare Friday morning. The 20-year-old college student was trying to return home to Kansas City after five months of studying abroad in Italy when she arrived in Chicago early Thursday evening to learn the last leg of her flight had been canceled. 
 
 Exhausted and teary-eyed, Henderson said she planned to get some sleep in a nearby hotel before trying to catch a flight to St Louis early Friday. She said her father planned to drive across Missouri to get her. 
 
 ""It was the closest I can get,"" Henderson said. 
 
 In Madison, Wis., more than 19 inches of snow fell, prompting the University of Wisconsin at Madison to cancel Thursday's finals. Senior Elle Knutson, 21, said she spent most of the day in her apartment chatting with friends on the Internet and staring out her window at the snow. 
 
 ""At first it was kind of nice, but I'm going a little stir-crazy,"" Knutson said Thursday night. 
 
 The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa, through Albert Lea, Minn. Iowa and Wisconsin activated National Guard troops to help rescue stranded drivers. 
 
 In Iowa, two people were killed and seven injured in a 25-vehicle pileup. Drivers were blinded by blowing snow and didn't see vehicles that had slowed or stopped on Interstate 35 about 60 miles north of Des Moines, state police said. A chain reaction of crashes involving semitrailers and passenger cars closed down a section of the highway. 
 
 Three other states also had traffic deaths that were blamed on the storm. There were at least two deaths in each Nebraska and Wisconsin, and one in Kansas. 
 
 In southeastern Utah, a woman who tried to walk for help after her car became stuck in snow died Tuesday night. 
 
 On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs in Alabama. 
 
 The flight cancellations were getting a lot of attention because the storm came just a few days before Christmas. But Daniel Baker, CEO of flight tracking service FlightAware.com, called it ""a relatively minor event in the overall scheme of things."" 
 
 By comparison, airlines canceled more than 13,000 flights over a two-day period during a February 2011 snowstorm that hit the Midwest. And more than 20,000 flights were canceled during Superstorm Sandy.

 A major snowstorm that was sweeping across the Midwest and beyond, left at least eight people dead, clogged highways and forced hundreds of flight delays and cancellations at airports already bracing for the holiday rush. 
 
 The storm was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow.

 Blizzard warnings were in effect in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, according to the National Weather Service. The Weather Channel reported that parts of 17 states are under winter weather advisories -- as far west as Washington state and as far east as Maine. 
 
 The storm brought much-needed precipitation for drought-plagued regions but was bad news for holiday travelers. Most of the nation's big airlines responded to the storm's threat by enacting flexible rebooking policies for passengers scheduled to fly into the storm's path. 
 
 The storm led airlines to cancel about 1,000 flights ahead of the Christmas holiday — relatively few compared to past big storms, though the number was climbing. 
 
 More than 600 flights were canceled at Chicago's two airports, O'Hare and Midway. O'Hare is a major hub for both United and American, meaning the disruption could ripple out and affect fliers at other airports.

 United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. 
 
 American Airlines cancelled flights scheduled to depart after 8 p.m. CT on Thursday. 
 
 The snowstorm walloped Iowa, where almost a foot of snow has fallen in Des Moines. State police said a 25-vehicle pileup killed at least two people, and across Iowa 30,900 customers were without power Thursday, including more than 25,000 in the Des Moines area. 
 
 The storm dropped as much as 13 inches of snow on portions of central Iowa, paralyzed travel, knocked out power to scores of people and closed schools, government offices and businesses across the state. 
 
 ""It's just awful out there,"" Capt. Mike Winter of the Iowa State Patrol said. ""People need to just stay home."" 
 
 The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa through Albert Lea, Minnesota. 
 
 Most major roads across Iowa remained closed either by official order or impassible due to snow and ice buildup late Thursday. 
 
 The Iowa State Patrol said at least 88 crashes occurred on highways and interstate systems Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon. There were also at least 164 emergency calls from the public and 161 motorist assists. 
 
 On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs Alabama. 
 
 In southeastern Wisconsin, where a blizzard warning was in effect, sheriff's officials said slick conditions led to at least two fatalities late Wednesday when a driver lost control of his car in Rock County, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago. 
 
 The weather service was forecasting ""thundersnow"" in Milwaukee and the surrounding areas, where snow could fall at the rate of 2-3 inches an hour. 
 
 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency, which put the state emergency government, National Guard, State Patrol and other agencies on high alert. 
 
 At least two people in Nebraska died in crashes blamed on poor driving conditions, the State Patrol said. In many areas, drivers were being told to stay off the roads because of whiteout conditions. Most of I-80 in the state was closed. Nebraska's biggest school districts canceled classes, as did many districts across the region. 
 
 In Utah, Washington County sheriff's detective Nate Abbott says the woman and a man were driving when their car got stuck in rural Washington County on Tuesday night during the storm that hit the Rocky Mountain region. 
 
 He says the pair started walking for help, but the woman couldn't go any farther and sought shelter while the man continued on. Search-and-rescue teams later found her body. 
 
 Although the Plains and Midwest could do without the travel headaches, precipitation should be welcome. 
 
 More than 93% of the high Plains region and 54% of the Midwest are enduring drought conditions, according to Thursday's U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal website that tracks drought. 
 
 Out west, the leading edge of a powerful storm system arrived in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. Rain is expected across Northern California from late Thursday through the weekend, with heavy snow possible in the Sierra Nevada range as the system moves east. 
 
 Four to seven feet of snow is forecast to fall above 7,000 feet, prompting the U.S. Forest Service to issue an avalanche warning for Mount Shasta.

169,"The publication of Albert Einstein’s private diaries detailing his tour of Asia in the 1920s reveals the theoretical physicist and humanitarian icon’s racist attitudes to the people he met on his travels, particularly the Chinese. 
 
 Written between October 1922 and March 1923, the diaries see the scientist musing on his travels, science, philosophy and art. In China, the man who famously once described racism as “a disease of white people” describes the “industrious, filthy, obtuse people” he observes. He notes how the “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” After earlier writing of the “abundance of offspring” and the “fecundity” of the Chinese, he goes on to say: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.” 
 
 Ze’ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, said: “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular. 
 
 “They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.”

 Rosenkranz has edited and translated The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, which have just been published for the first time as a standalone volume by Princeton University Press, including facsimiles of the diary pages. The diaries have only previously been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, with small supplementary translations into English. A spokesperson for Princeton University Press said: “This is the first time Einstein’s travel diary will be made available to anyone who isn’t a serious Einstein scholar.” 
 
 Further passages in the diaries, which are thought to have been written for Einstein’s stepdaughters in Berlin while he and his wife were travelling in Asia, Spain and Palestine, and as an aide memoire, see him writing of the Chinese that “even those reduced to working like horses never give the impression of conscious suffering. A peculiar herd-like nation [ … ] often more like automatons than people.” He later adds, in Rosenkranz’s words, “a healthy dose of extreme misogyny” to his xenophobia with the observation: “I noticed how little difference there is between men and women; I don’t understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring”. 
 
 In Colombo in Ceylon, Einstein writes of how the locals “live in great filth and considerable stench at ground level” adding that they “do little, and need little. The simple economic cycle of life.” 
 
 Einstein’s perceptions of the Japanese he meets are, in contrast, more positive: “Japanese unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing,” he writes. “Pure souls as nowhere else among people. One has to love and admire this country.” But Rosenkranz points out that he also concludes that the “intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones – natural disposition?” 
 
 “Einstein’s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist – in these instances, other peoples are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism. The disquieting comment that the Chinese may ‘supplant all other races’ is also most revealing in this regard,” writes Rosenkranz. 
 
 “Here, Einstein perceives a foreign ‘race’ as a threat, which … is one of the characteristics of a racist ideology. Yet the remark that must strike the modern reader as most offensive is his feigning not to understand how Chinese men can find their women sufficiently attractive to have offspring with them. In light of these instances, we must conclude that Einstein did make quite a few racist and dehumanising comments in the diary, some of which were extremely unpleasant.” 
 
 Rosenkranz told the Guardian that although views like Einstein’s were prevalent at the time, they were not universal. “That’s usually the reaction I get – ‘we have to understand, he was of the zeitgeist, part of the time’ – but I think I tried here and there to give a broader context. There were other views out there, more tolerant views,” he said. 
 
 In his introduction, Rosenkranz writes how it is important to explore how a humanist icon such as Einstein – whose image was once used for a UNHCR campaign with the slogan “A bundle of belongings isn’t the only thing a refugee brings to his new country. Einstein was a refugee” – could have written xenophobic comments about the peoples he encountered. 
 
 “The answer to this question seems very relevant in today’s world, in which the hatred of the other is so rampant in so many places around the world,” he writes. “It seems that even Einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognising himself in the face of the other.” ||||| Albert Einstein is not just revered as the scientist behind the theory of relativity but also as a humanitarian icon. However, excerpts of the physicist’s private diaries, which detail his travels around Spain, Palestine, Japan, China, and Singapore in the early 1920s, will significantly diminish his stature as the latter. 
 
 The Nobel Prize winner and civil rights advocate is remembered for his stance against discrimination, both in his native Germany and in the United States. In a speech at Lincoln University in 1946—the first US institution to grant degrees to African-Americans—he famously stated that racism was a “disease of white people.” 
 
 And yet, The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein reveal that his impressions of people he met were, in fact, racist. The journals—which were reportedly not intended for public consumption—have been translated from German and published by Princeton University Press, which the publisher says is “the first time Einstein’s travel diary will be made available to anyone who isn’t a serious Einstein scholar.” 
 
 Quotes from the volume make for unsettling reading. He describes “industrious, filthy, obtuse people” he met on his travels, and is particularly racist towards the Chinese, writing that “it would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.” 
 
 The senior editor of the published diaries, Ze’ev Rosenkranz, told the Guardian that Einstein’s observations, in no uncertain terms, underpin many of the racist ideas about the inferiority of races that persist today. 
 
 “Einstein’s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist—in these instances, other people are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism. The disquieting comment that the Chinese may ‘supplant all other races’ is also most revealing in this regard.” ||||| Albert Einstein’s racist attitudes towards Chinese people have been revealed following the publication of travel diaries he kept during a visit to Asia in the 1920s. 
 
 The previously unseen journals have been published by Princeton University Press, documenting the scientist’s five-and-a-half month travels between 1922 and 1923 to China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan, as well as Palestine and Spain. 
 
 The publisher describes the diaries as detailing Einstein’s “quirky, succinct, and at times irreverent” musings on science, philosophy, art and politics, adding the handwritten journals also reveal his “stereotyping of members of various nations and raise questions about his attitudes on race.” 
 
 In one excerpt, seen by The Guardian, Einstein describes the Chinese as “industrious, filthy, obtuse people,” later calling them a “peculiar herd-like nation… often more like automatons than people.” 
 
 ""It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary,” he adds. 
 
 In another entry, Einstein described how “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” 
 
 The book, The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein: The Far East, Palestine, and Spain, 1922–1923, was edited by Ze’ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology.

 Speaking to The Guardian, Rosenkranz admits that some of the passenges written by Einstein are “pretty unpleasant—what he says about the Chinese in particular.” 
 
 “They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon,"" he adds. ""I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements.They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.” 
 
 Einstein became an American citizen in 1940 after deciding he could not to return to his native Germany following the rise of the Nazi party and Adolf Hitler. The Nobel Prize-winning physicist famously described racism as a “disease of white people” during a speech at Pennsylvania’s Lincoln University in 1946. 
 
 In a Q and A with the Einstein Papers project to promote the book, Rosenkranz said that writing about a famous historical figure's personal life can provide “fascinating insights” about their personalities. 
 
 “The intention is not salacious but rather a genuine attempt to understand what makes such celebrities tick,” he adds. “This is particularly pertinent in Einstein's case, where there is such a great discrepancy between the public image and the actual historical individual. ”","– In a 1946 speech, Albert Einstein described racism as a ""disease of white people."" He apparently had it, as revealed in the genius's travel diaries, published entirely in English for the first time, per Quartz. Describing travels through China, Singapore, Japan, Palestine, and Spain between 1922 and 1923, per Newsweek, Einstein's writing shows an apparent obsession with the word ""obtuse"" and an overall unfavorable attitude toward Chinese people. He describes them as ""industrious, filthy, obtuse people"" with an ""abundance"" of ""obtuse"" offspring, reports the Guardian. Commenting on ""little difference"" between Chinese men and women, he goes on to wonder ""what kind of fatal attraction"" females possess that ""enthrals the corresponding men.""

 President Obama invited Karzai to visit Washington on May 12, but Gibbs said that subsequent ""troubling and untruthful remarks"" by the Afghan president have raised questions about the value of such a meeting. 
 
 The government will evaluate any further Karzai remarks to determine whether the meeting should take place, Gibbs said. 
 
 Karzai was re-elected president last year in voting that was marred by irregularities and that required a runoff. 
 
 On Friday, Karzai irritated the Obama administration when he blamed the irregularities on foreigners who want a ""puppet government"" in Afghanistan. 
 
 He further aggravated Washington, his biggest backer, on Sunday when he told a gathering of tribal leaders that the U.S.-led alliance will not move against Taliban fighters in Kandahar ""until you say we can."" 
 
 ""I can't speak to why he said those things,"" Gibbs said. ""They're troubling. They are confusing. They've been investigated and found to be untruthful."" ||||| « Previous | Main | Next » 
 
 White House Refuses to Say If Karzai is U.S. Ally 
 
 White House press secretary Robert Gibbs today continued his criticism of the comments by Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- and when pressed, Gibbs refused to say if Karzai was an ally of the U.S. 
 
 Speaking to Afghan lawmakers over the weekend, Karzai suggested he might have to join the Taliban himself if the United States does not stop “meddling.” Gibbs called Karzai's most recent comments ""troubling,"" ""confusing,"" and ""untruthful."" 
 
 So ABC News asked: ""Is Karzai our ally?"" 
 
 Gibbs' response: ""Karzai is the democratically elected leader of Afghanistan."" 
 
 ""That’s not what I asked,"" ABC News noted. ""Is he our ally?"" 
 
 Said Gibbs: ""There are times in which the actions that he takes are constructive to governance. I would say that the remarks he’s made I can’t imagine that anyone in this country found them anything other than troubling. 
 
 ""So our position on this, Jake, is that when the Afghan leaders take steps to improve governance and root out corruption, then the president will say kind words,"" Gibbs said. ""When leaders need to hear stern language from this administration about the consequences of not acting, we’ll do that as well.""

 ""We did find out they did do a CT scan. The brain right now is a little swollen,"" said Joe Tavares, Kristen's father. 
 
 The mother of two young children went in to have her wisdom teeth removed on Monday and didn't wake up. Her dad happened to be on Oahu today for his own medical appointment. 
 
 ""It's a lot of stress on everybody right now,"" said Joe Tavares. 
 
 Dr. John Stover does a lot of procedures, everything from cosmetic to plastic surgery in addition to the oral surgery. His medical and dental licenses are in good standing. 
 
 However we discovered Dr. Stover has had four previous complaints with the state since 2010. Two complaints for ""failure to comply with laws governing professional conduct"" were resolved without enough evidence. Two other complaints from 2012 and 2013 are still ongoing. 
 
 He has also been sued for medical malpractice, however that case was dismissed. 
 
 Sources say Dr. Stover requested the use of full anesthesia for his dental practice in 2005, however that was denied. In 2007 he was granted the permit to use ""intravenous-conscious or moderate-conscious sedation."" 
 
 On his medical license he is allowed to use full anesthesia. Since oral surgery, including wisdom teeth extraction, is considered a medical procedure he would be allowed to use full anesthesia if necessary. 
 
 The section regarding anesthesia on his website says it is in development. 
 
 Today we spoke with the 17 year old girl who had her wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Stover right before Kristen Tavares. 
 
 ""I just saw them stick something in my arm and I don't remember what happened after that,"" said the patient who requested we not use her name. ""It's a scary thought because, to know that I went through the same procedure as she did, that it could have been me that couldn't have woken up, it's just really freaky."" 
 
 Tavares was alone in the dentist's office and Dr. Stover hasn't returned our calls so it's unclear what exactly happened. 
 
 Experts say problems often start when breathing stops. 
 
 ""Statistically it's usually an airway issue,"" said Daniel L. Orr II, DDS, Professor and Director, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Anesthesiology at UNLV. ""Perhaps a foreign body drops into the airway like a tooth, or a piece of gauze or perhaps the patient might vomit and get fluid up their airway and then down into their lungs. That's why we have them don't eat or drink before a general anesthetic or any anesthetic."" 
 
 Today the Tavares family is focused on recovery rather than blame. 
 
 ""Right now all we are doing is praying and hoping for the best,"" said Joe Tavares. 
 
 Tavares' family says they weren't given a timeline. Right now it's a waiting game on her recovery.

 A 23-year-old mother of two small children from the Big Island went into a coma and then on life support at Maui Memorial Medical Center following a visit to a Hilo dentist’s office on Monday. 
 
 Kristen Tavares reportedly went into cardiac arrest while undergoing a procedure to remove four wisdom teeth at the office of John Stover, a self-described cosmetic surgeon who state records show is licensed in Hawaii as both a medical doctor and a dentist. 
 
 State records available online show that Stover has been the target of three medical complaints with the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, two of which are pending. The other one, from 2012, alleges that Stover failed to comply with both licensing rules and laws governing professional conduct; the department’s Regulated Industries Complaints Office, however, didn’t find sufficient evidence and no action was taken, according to state records.","– A Hawaii woman went in for routine dental work on Monday but ... didn't wake up.

 Saudi activist Loujain Hathloul as she drove toward the Saudi border in December 2014. (Loujain Hathloul/AP) 
 
 She was jailed for 10 weeks for driving. But Saudi officials will let her run. 
 
 In a surprise reversal Wednesday, Saudi Arabia lifted its election block on activist-slash-candidate Loujain Hathloul, who gained fame last year by live-streaming her defiance of the kingdom’s ban driving for women. 
 
 The decision clears the way for Hathloul’s name to be on Saturday’s ballot in Riyadh as part of nationwide races for municipal council seats – the first elections in the ultraconservative kingdom to allow women to compete and vote. More than 900 women are among the nearly 7,000 candidates. 
 
 Until late Wednesday, Hathloul was blackballed along with some other prominent women activists – including two human rights campaigners. For weeks, Hathloul had pushed back, seeking some leverage to get officials to reconsider the ban. 
 
 She gave interviews to anyone who would listen. She used connections within the ruling system to lobby for a review of the ban. 
 
 “Basically, I annoyed them,” she said. “I guess it worked. It’s amazing news.” 
 
 Saudi officials have given no public explanations at the rollback -- just as they made no formal disclosures on the reasons for keeping some candidates off the election lists. 
 
 But what likely tipped the scales was a relentless social media blitz by Hathloul’s supporters. Saudi rulers have long conceded ground to online critics – giving them ample room to grouse, network and muse. Crackdowns come when it crosses over into what authorities perceive as challenges to the state or status quo – meaning the ruling family and the powerful religious establishment that has a hand in all key decisions. 
 
 [If you keep saying Saudi Arabia is like ISIS, you might get sued] 
 
 This week, however, all of Saudi officialdom is looking to make a good impression with the world’s media shifting its attention to the elections. It's unclear whether the ban will remain in place for the two other women rights activists. 
 
 “After I was banned, I wanted to make sure I wasn’t ignored,” said Hathloul. “This means, of course, making some noise.” 
 
 She’s no stranger to that. In late 2014, Hathloul got in a car in the United Arab Emirates and drove toward Saudi Arabia with a video camera and her UAE driver’s license. Part of the trip was live-streamed onto the Web. 
 
 She was arrested by Saudi border officials and spent 73 days in jail, making her for a time among the best-known Saudi activists. 
 
 A year earlier, her husband-to-be, a well-known Saudi satirist named Farhad Albutairi, helped produce one of his memorable videos: “No Woman, No Drive” to the tune of the Bob Marley classic “No Woman, No Cry.” 
 
 Hathloul said her initial motivation to run for a council seat was simply to boost the number of women taking part. After the ban, she now wonders if she could pull off a win. 
 
 “The goal has changed,” she said. “I want to make a point. It’s a personal thing now. The municipal councils have nothing to do with the driving ban. The councils are just about fixing up the community. The driving ban is another fight. It's definitely not forgotten.” ||||| A female activist who was jailed for 10 weeks for violating Saudi Arabia’s ban on women driving is running for office after a surprise U-turn by the government. 
 
 Loujain al-Hathloul made international headlines last year, when she filmed herself driving from the United Arab Emirates to the Saudi Arabian border in protest against the restrictions on women drivers. 
 
 Police forced her to wait in the car overnight after confiscating her passport. She and a friend who drove supplies to her from Dubai, Maysaa al-Amoudi, were arrest after being ordered to cross the border in their vehicles. 
 
 They were referred to a Saudi terrorism court because of their posts on social media and jailed for 10 weeks and have not stopped their campaign to overturn rules forbidding women from driving and stipulating that they must be accompanied by male chaperones. 
 
 Ms al-Hathloul announced her intention to run for a seat on the local council in Riyadh earlier this year but was swiftly blacklisted among several other women by Saudi authorities. 
 
 But the move was reversed on Wednesday following an appeal, clearing the way for her name to be on Saturday’s ballot in the city. 
 
 Ms al-Hathloul told the Washington Post she lobbied against the ban and conducted media interviews and a social media campaign to put pressure on the government.

 “Basically, I annoyed them,” she said. “I guess it worked. It’s amazing news… The municipal councils have nothing to do with the driving ban. 
 
 “The councils are just about fixing up the community. The driving ban is another fight.” 
 
 Her husband, a Saudi satirist named Fahad Albutairi, helped produce a viral video called “No Woman, No Drive” taking a light-hearted look at the law to the tune of a famous Bob Marley song.

 Waco police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton said an uninvited group appeared for Sunday's meeting of a loose confederation of biker gangs at a restaurant. 
 
 One man was injured when a vehicle rolled over his foot. That caused a dispute that continued inside the restaurant, where fighting and then shooting began, before the melee spilled back outside, Swanton said. 
 
 Authorities offered few details. It was not clear which gang was responsible for running over the biker's foot or which gang the aggrieved biker belonged to. 
 
 When the shootout was over, nine people were dead and 18 wounded. 
 
 Police have said five biker gangs from across Texas had gathered in part to settle differences over turf. 
 
 Jimmy Graves, who described himself as an ambassador for the gang known as the Bandidos, disputed that claim, saying the groups had planned to discuss laws protecting motorcycle riders and other topics such as trademarks for club logos. 
 
 But he acknowledged that differences with other groups, such as the Cossacks, have been ""simmering and brewing."" 
 
 Another biker named Johnny Snyder said he was at the restaurant for a quarterly meeting to talk about legislative issues. 
 
 Snyder, a long-haul trucker, declined to describe what he saw inside the restaurant, saying he was only concerned with ""not getting shot."" 
 
 He is vice president of the Boozefighters Motorcycle Club in Waco, a group that Snyder says hosts charity events and family gatherings and is not a criminal gang. 
 
 About 50 weapons were confiscated, mostly knives and firearms, and Swanton said more than 100 weapons may be found once authorities are done analyzing the crime scene at the Twin Peaks restaurant, which is part of a national chain that features waitresses in revealing uniforms. 
 
 Preliminary autopsy results showed all nine of the dead were killed by gunshots. Many were hit in the head, neck, chest or torso. Most of the men were in their 40s, but they ranged in age from 27 to 65, according to reports released by a McLennan County justice of the peace. 
 
 Police have acknowledged firing on armed bikers, but it was unclear how many of the dead were shot by gang members and how many were shot by officers. 
 
 Of the injured, seven remain hospitalized. Swanton, who has been virtually the sole source of law enforcement information on the fight, described their conditions as stable. 
 
 He said the investigation is being hampered by witnesses who ""are not being honest with us."" 
 
 Police are concerned that the brawl will invite retaliation and more violence, Swanton said. 
 
 ""We would encourage them to try to be a little peaceful and let the bloodshed stop,"" he said. 
 
 About 170 bikers have been charged with engaging in organized crime. Swanton said more arrests are likely. 
 
 Katie Rhoten, whose husband, Theron Rhoten, was taken into custody, said he told her by phone from jail that he and two other members of a motorcycle club called Vise Grip had just pulled up to the restaurant. 
 
 ""They got off their bikes, and bullets were ricocheting all around them, so they ducked and ran for cover,"" she said in an interview. 
 
 When her husband, a mechanic from Austin, and the others went back to retrieve their motorcycles, they were detained by police. 
 
 ""They were told they were being held for questioning and released, and they sat in the parking lot for three, four, five hours."" 
 
 Then, she said, police ""changed their mind and arrested everybody on the scene."" 
 
 Officers took into custody all sorts of ""nonviolent, noncriminal people. I mean, they got the Bikers for Christ guys in there."" 
 
 In a memo dated May 1, the Texas Department of Public Safety cautioned about increasing violence between the Bandidos and the Cossacks, Dallas TV station WFAA reported Monday. 
 
 The department's Joint Information Center bulletin said the tension could stem from Cossacks refusing to pay Bandidos dues for operating in Texas and for wearing a patch on their vest that claimed Texas as their turf without the Bandidos' approval. 
 
 ""Traditionally, the Bandidos have been the dominant motorcycle club in Texas, and no other club is allowed to wear the Texas bar without their consent,"" the bulletin said, according to WFAA. 
 
 The bulletin said the FBI had received information that the Bandidos had discussed ""going to war with Cossacks."" It also outlined several recent incidents between the two groups, including one instance in March when about 10 Cossacks forced a Bandido to pull over along Interstate 35 near Waco and attacked him with ""chains, batons and metal pipes before stealing his motorcycle,"" WFAA reported. 
 
 That same day, a group of Bandidos confronted a Cossack member fueling up at a truck stop in Palo Pinto County, west of Fort Worth, the bulletin said. When the Cossack member refused to remove the Texas patch from his vest, the Bandidos hit him in the head with a hammer and stole it. 
 
 The Department of Public Safety declined to release the bulletin to The Associated Press. 
 
 There are other documented instances of violence between the groups. 
 
 Last March, two members of the Bandidos were indicted in connection with the stabbing of two Cossacks at an Abilene steakhouse. 
 
 And in December, three Bandidos were arrested for a shooting at a Fort Worth motorcycle bar that left one dead and two others wounded. Fort Worth police said the victims were known members of a criminal motorcycle gang. 
 
 The Bandidos ""constitute a growing criminal threat,"" the Justice Department said in a report on outlaw motorcycle gangs. The report said the Bandidos are involved in transporting and distributing cocaine and marijuana and in the production and distribution of methamphetamine.

174,"Daniela Ralph from Ohio is celebrating during the first day of the 4/20 weekend in Civic Center Park on Saturday. ( Hyoung Chang, The Denver Post ) 
 
 Beefy, black-clad security officers — donning bulletproof vests and perched on a scaffolding — peered across Civic Center park through military-style binoculars Saturday as crowds began to grow for the first day of Denver's 4/20 rally. 
 
 Teams of security officers performed ""soft"" body patdowns and backpack searches before allowing people through any of the several entry gates. An officer only half-jokingly said he was checking for guns, knives and high explosives. 
 
 The watch tower and patdowns are just a few of the enhanced security measures for this year's 4/20 event that were noticeably absent from the 2013 gathering, marred by the shooting of two people in the leg, as well as a stampede toward the stage. Also, a third person was grazed by a bullet in the shooting. 
 
 ""It's presidential-style security,"" chief organizer Miguel Lopez boasted about this weekend. 
 
 He was more sheepish when he spoke of last year's security breaches, when a crowd tumbled through a barricade and trampled one another while ascending the stage. 
 
 This year, Lopez hired three security companies to patrol the two-day event. Glendale Mayor Mike Dunafon, who is running for governor as an independent, also hired a captain and a lieutenant from his department to help. He paid for it himself. One of the security teams had 40 security guards carrying guns and handcuffs. 
 
 ""We're armed and everything,"" said Jesse Peña, owner of Special Agent Security Service. ""If we see a crime happen, we do an arrest and then just get a police officer.""

 Police issued citations to a couple of the private security guards for lacking the appropriate license, said Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson. 
 
 Part of the reason for enhanced security are projections that because of legal marijuana, the crowds of people from across the country are likely to at least double last year's numbers. Lopez was expecting 80,000 visitors Sunday. 
 
 The Denver Police Department — which said it had cited or arrested 25 people, 17 for public marijuana smoking, on Saturday — invited state and federal law enforcement officers to tour its command center at police headquarters a block away. The communications center has about 50 TV screens that can flip back and forth to 138 HALO and 38 traffic cameras. 
 
 Pat Phelan, commander of the department's special-operations unit, said the cameras will ensure rapid deployment of a beefed-up downtown police presence Saturday and Sunday. 
 
 ""We don't expect to see a problem, but we're prepared if there is,"" Cmdr. Matt Murray said Saturday. 
 
 Avid marijuana inhaler Guy Orvis, 62, of Denver, who rode to the festival in a wheelchair rigged out like a lounge chair, said the extra security makes a lot of sense. 
 
 ""It puts everybody on notice to keep it on the down low. I'm not about violence or anything,"" he said. 
 
 He denied that the smoke — with a particular scent — pumping out of a cannister at the back of his wheelchair was cannabis-infused. But a small crowd of people followed him around the park sniffing deeply and giggling. ||||| DENVER (AP) — Once the province of activists and stoners, the traditional pot holiday of April 20 has gone mainstream in the first state in the nation to legalize recreational marijuana.

 Tens of thousands gathered for a weekend of Colorado cannabis-themed festivals and entertainment, from a marijuana industry expo called the Cannabis Cup at a trade center north of downtown, to 4/20-themed concerts at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater — acts include Slightly Stoopid and Snoop Dogg — to a massive festival in the shadow of the state capitol where clouds of cannabis smoke are expected to waft at 4:20 p.m. MDT Sunday. 
 
 The festival in Denver's Civic Center Park is the most visible sign of the transformation. It started as a defiant gathering of marijuana activists, but this year the event has an official city permit, is organized by an events management company and featured booths selling funnel cakes and Greek food next to kiosks hawking hemp lollipops and glass pipes. 
 
 Gavin Beldt, one of the organizers, said in a statement that the event is now a ""celebration of legal status for its use in Colorado and our launch of an exciting new experience for those attending. "" 
 
 On Saturday, the first day of the two-day festival, only a few people lingered on the steps of a Roman-style amphitheater where marijuana activists spoke angrily about bans on the drug in other states. Thousands instead lingered on the park's broad lawns, listening to hip-hop music blasting from the sound stage and enjoying the fresh, albeit marijuana-scented, air. 
 
 ""It's a lot mellower this year,"" said Cody Andrews, 29, of Denver. ""It's more of a venue now. More vendor-y."" 
 
 Last year's event was marred by an unsolved shooting that wounded three. This year a fence rings the park. Security guards in protective gear roam the grounds, and all entrants are being checked for weapons. 
 
 Earlier this year, there was tension when some organizers wanted to officially sanction a 4:20 p.m. Sunday smokeout, but the city noted that public consumption of marijuana is still illegal in Colorado. By Saturday night, Denver police said they had issued at least 17 citations for public pot smoking. 
 
 Still, participants expect to light up on Sunday, which happens to also be Easter Sunday. Plenty weren't waiting until 4/20 proper. On Saturday, Jairin Genung, 25, of Aurora, sat on the grass with friends, including one who was carefully rolling a thick joint. 
 
 ""We're going to light up no matter what,"" Genung said. ""If you can't smoke at the 4/20 rally, it just doesn't make sense."" 
 
 The whole scene was wonderfully surreal for Bud Long, 49, from Kalamazoo, Mich., who recalled taking part in his first 4/20 protest in 1984. 
 
 ""Nationwide, it'll be decriminalized,"" he predicted, ""and we'll be doing this in every state.""

 Weed and a tale of two cities 
 
 Though the date has long been observed in Colorado, this is the first celebration since recreational sales of marijuana became legal here on New Year's Day. (Recreational use became legal in late 2012.) 
 
 Replete with the Denver ""420 Rally"" in Civic Center Park, the High Times Cannabis Cup -- an expo and a competition sponsored by the magazine -- and a 420 concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre headlined by Snoop Dogg, the weekend has drawn the trappings one might expect. Dreadlocks. Tie-dye. T-shirts brandishing phrases like ""Cheech & Chong for President."" 
 
 Those predictable, or stereotypical, images, however, only tell part of the story. 
 
 They don't speak for the white-haired Mississippi man who looked like he'd walked out of a law firm on casual Friday. They don't reflect what drew a Crohn's disease patient from Missouri. Nor do they represent three older Texas women, one with her nails perfectly manicured in hot pink and her hair done just so, who advocate on behalf of seniors and are working to reform marijuana laws. 
 
 ""We're not trying to force people to smoke pot,"" said Dawn Brooks, 62, of Austin, the one with the bright nails. ""Cannabis is merely a plant. That's all it is. And more and more seniors are coming out of the closet."" 
 
 This is a weekend that draws people of various backgrounds and with different needs and desires. 
 
 That said, for many of those who turned out Saturday, the vast majority it seemed from out-of-state, it was all about the smoking. And for some of them, it was in a frenzied way -- a mad rush to try everything because they couldn't take any of it home. 
 
 Kate, a 30-year-old from Kansas City, Missouri, was waiting with her boyfriend, Scott, for a free bus ride to the Cannabis Cup expo at Denver Mart. 
 
 ""It's like his Super Bowl,"" said Kate, who, like many people we spoke to, didn't want her last name used. ""He's been giddy about it for weeks. ... Super stoked is an understatement."" 
 
 Bus to Show, a nonprofit that works to reduce intoxicated driving, partnered with High Times to offer transportation this weekend. It set up a downtown location for pickups and drop-offs outside Cheba Hut, a marijuana-themed sub shop. 
 
 Besides the free shuttles to and from the expo, the organization sold out a $20-a-day hop-on, hop-off shuttle tour of what it called The Cannabis Freedom Trail. The CannaBUS, as the tour shuttles are called, have been shepherding as many as 200 people a day to various cannabis dispensaries around town. 
 
 On one tour we joined, smoke wafted out windows. Strangers shared pipes and exchanged samples of weed and wax, a concentrated form of marijuana. Canisters of buds bearing names like ""tangerine haze"" and ""strawberry cough,"" were passed around to smell. Nutella pancakes came up in conversations at least three times. 
 
 Wearing a neon green wig and green Power Ranger mini-dress, Teri Starbird, 50, who lives outside Wichita, Kansas, lit up some ""Bruce Banner."" It is one of the contenders in this year's Cannabis Cup competition. 
 
 ""Oh, that's very smooth,"" she said, passing the pipe to her friend. ""But I'll tell you what, there are some mad scientists in this town. Some of this stuff makes you plain stupid."" 
 
 While other groups actually visited dispensaries on the tour, no one in this crew bothered to get off the bus. Two guys from South Jersey sat dazed, staring out their windows. 
 
 ""I'm too f**king stoned to get out,"" said a 22-year-old from New Mexico, who donned a Captain America baseball cap and heroically bounded over bus seats to take a hit of what others were smoking. 
 
 Back at the sandwich shop, the final stop on the tour, he and the others had no choice but to stumble off the bus. 
 
 ""Chaz"" shows off his marijuana-themed hat during the 420 Rally at Civic Center Park in Denver. 
 
 Inside Cheba Hut, where 12-inch subs are called ""blunts,"" drinks are listed as ""cotton mouth cures"" and desserts and chips fall under ""munchies,"" a woman from Brooklyn, New York, stared up at the menu board -- her eyes as wide as her smile. 
 
 ""Oh, my God, that bread's crazy,"" she said loudly to no one. ""Oh, my God, they have Kool-Aid here! What?"" 
 
 Outside, bus driver Jody Stonebraker called us on board for the free ride to the expo. She offered lighters and bottles of water to her passengers as she drove them to Denver Mart, where tens of thousands gathered for the High Times Cannabis Cup. With bus windows open to keep her sober, she moved us on. 
 
 A guy from San Francisco struggled to roll a joint; when the bus stopped short, his weed went flying. A man from Florida looked around at the peaceful, smiling faces of his fellow passengers and wanted to know where else people were this happy. And a conversation across the aisle between two people began and ended like this: 
 
 ""What was your favorite?"" 
 
 ""Green."" 
 
 ""What?"" 
 
 Stonebraker, 54, said she's met people this weekend from all over the country, even the world -- including Germany, Japan and Mexico. She can't stop singing the praises of her cannabis-loving passengers. 
 
 ""It's been so fun, and I'm getting paid for this,"" she said. ""I tended bar for 16 years, and they were all jerks. Every other person, you wanted to shoot. You guys are awesome!""

 That sort of comparison to drinkers came up time and again. People who waited three hours to get into Denver Mart boasted that there were no fights, screaming or pushing. 
 
 A couple from Kansas City, Missouri, was among those who waited for hours to get in, but Sam, 58, and Joyce, 53, couldn't have looked less put out. They were draped in Mardi Gras beads. He wore a jester's hat; she a crown made of plastic marijuana leaves. They were simply thrilled. 
 
 ""Nobody's tripping. Nobody's acting like you're from Mars,"" Joyce said. ""There's freedom to smoke. You don't have to hide in a basement or under a blanket."" 
 
 The couple, married for 32 years, raised children successfully. Sam spent 35 years working his tail off in the commercial roofing business. 
 
 ""So don't tell me it makes me lazy,"" he said. 
 
 In hallways outside the exhibition hall, people sat on the floor, tossing back small bags of Cheetos and Doritos. A man was hunched over in a corner, taking a nap. Another guy greeted people just inside, offering patriotic-looking stickers that resembled those handed out on Election Day -- except these said ""I Smoked."" 
 
 A stroll past the booths in the packed hall offered a head-spinning glimpse into the big business that is cannabis. 
 
 There were hydrocarbon extraction machines, easy at-home growing systems, and high-powered leaf trimmers. There were academies offering certification courses, products to detoxify the body, and tips and tools to make edibles. There were cannabis-themed clothing companies, glass pipes available in all shapes -- including that of Mr. Potato Head -- and people sitting beneath lights and in front of cameras for a segment of The Plant Channel. 
 
 There was even an agency called Hemp Temps, to meet the staffing needs of the growing industry. 
 
 Behind the building, in a fenced-in outdoor area where 21-and-over wristbands were checked before entry, the smoke was thick. 
 
 Attendees crowded couches beneath tents, sampling wares. A grown man, dressed as an Oompa-Loompa, walked by as another guy inhaled smoke from a three-foot-long bong. An emergency medical team tended to an older man who passed out, his head bleeding from when it hit the pavement after he smoked a dab, or high-grade hash oil.

 History of marijuana in America 40 photos History of marijuana in America 40 photos Public perceptions about pot have come a long way, from the dire warnings of ""Reefer Madness"" to growing acceptance of medical marijuana and the legalization of recreational use. Hide Caption 1 of 40 History of marijuana in America 40 photos Harry Anslinger was named commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics when it was established in 1930. While arguing for marijuana prohibition, he played on Americans' fear of crime and foreigners. He spun tales of people driven to insanity or murder after ingesting the drug and spoke of the 2 to 3 tons of grass being produced in Mexico. ""This, the Mexicans make into cigarettes, which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white high school students,"" Anslinger told Congress.

 The young woman who gave it to him cried, her hand trembling as she held a cigarette. 
 
 While some pulled out cell phones to take pictures of the man on the ground, others flocked to the shaken woman. 
 
 ""It's not your fault. It's not your fault,"" they said. ""He chose to take a dab."" 
 
 Amid this scare, and across town, there were reminders of the good that many say cannabis does when people are educated and use it responsibly. 
 
 At The Giving Tree of Denver, a dispensary, one of the managers prepared to close for the day. Dina Compassion marveled about the people she'd met so far this weekend. 
 
 They'd come from all over the United States. They were people suffering from PTSD, seizures and arthritis. They were cancer survivors. They were parents worried about their sick children. They were residents of other states who are thinking of moving to Colorado so they can ""manage pain in a safe way and not be carted off to jail,"" she said. 
 
 Compassion, 29, understands the benefits as much as anyone. After a serious car accident left her with nerve damage along the entire right side of her body, nothing seemed to help her regain feeling and movement -- until she tried cannabis. 
 
 ""It was a huge game changer,"" she said. ""I'm now planning a rock climbing trip for this summer."" 
 
 What she sees in her dispensary, what she sees in the crowds of people who've descended upon Denver this weekend, is a growing sense of community, a feeling that's expanding nationwide.

175,"Reuters Health - Parents who delay or skip childhood vaccinations even when kids have no medical reason to avoid their shots are contributing to U.S. outbreaks of measles and pertussis, a research review suggests. 
 
 A vial of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and an information sheet is seen at Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts February 26, 2015. REUTERS/Brian Snyder 
 
 More than half of 1,416 measles cases reported in the U.S. since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000 were for people with no history of measles vaccination, the analysis found. 
 
 Among more than 10,000 pertussis patients with known vaccination status, 24 to 45 percent of people in the five largest statewide epidemics since 1977 were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated, the analysis also found. 
 
 “If there are a high number of susceptible or unvaccinated individuals in the community the risk of getting infected – even for vaccinated children – goes up,” said senior study author Dr. Saad Omer, a pediatrics and epidemiology researcher at Emory University in Atlanta. 
 
 That’s because few vaccines are 100 percent effective, Omer added by email. 
 
 With pertussis, or whooping cough, up to 2 percent of people who receive all five recommended vaccine doses on time may still get this bacterial infection of the lungs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 
 For measles, roughly 3 percent of people who receive both recommended doses of the vaccine may still get the virus, according to the CDC. 
 
 These numbers are a best case scenario, assuming that only people with medical reasons – like certain cancer treatments, rare allergies to vaccine ingredients, or diseases that compromise the immune system – forgo inoculations. 
 
 But the CDC reports that fewer than 1 percent of kids need to skip vaccines for medical reasons, based on data from Mississippi and West Virginia, states that only grant exemptions under these circumstances. 
 
 Instead, Omer and colleagues found that the majority of measles and pertussis cases in the outbreaks they analyzed were due to people intentionally skipping vaccinations. 
 
 Among 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated people who were eligible to receive their shots, researchers report in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
 
 Most of these unvaccinated people – 405 of them – had nonmedical reasons for skipping vaccinations such as religious or philosophical objections, the analysis found. 
 
 For the subset of pertussis reports from outbreaks with detailed data on unvaccinated individuals, 59 to 93 percent of cases were for people who intentionally skipped their inoculations, the analysis also found. 
 
 Several pertussis cases also cropped up in highly vaccinated communities, suggesting waning immunity against the disease, the researchers note. 
 
 Limitations of the study include a focus on measles and pertussis in the context of vaccine exemption rates, which may have underestimated the disease risk associated with skipping vaccines, the authors point out. 
 
 Nonmedical exemptions also don’t explain all of the resurgence in measles and pertussis in recent years, Dr. Matthew Davis, a pediatrics researcher and deputy director of the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, noted in an editorial. 
 
 “It is very difficult to put a specific number on how much vaccine refusals reduce a community’s protection against disease,” Davis said by email. 
 
 “What this latest comprehensive review illustrates is that individuals who refuse vaccines not only put themselves at risk for disease,” Davis added. “It turns out that they also put others at risk too – even people who have been vaccinated before, but whose protection from those vaccinations may not be as strong as it used to be.” 
 
 SOURCE: bit.ly/1Rj5JhT JAMA, online March 15, 2016. ||||| Importance Parents hesitant to vaccinate their children may delay routine immunizations or seek exemptions from state vaccine mandates. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Improved understanding of the association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed. 
 
 Objective To review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine delay, refusal, or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 vaccine-preventable diseases with recent US outbreaks. 
 
 Evidence Review Search of PubMed through November 30, 2015, for reports of US measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the United States (after January 1, 2000), endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in US pertussis incidence (after January 1, 1977), and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of vaccine delay or exemption. 
 
 Findings We identified 18 published measles studies (9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak reports), which described 1416 measles cases (individual age range, 2 weeks-84 years; 178 cases younger than 12 months) and more than half (56.8%) had no history of measles vaccination. Of the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being vaccine eligible and 405 (70.6%) of these had nonmedical exemptions (eg, exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons, as opposed to medical contraindications; 41.8% of total). Among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks, which included 10 609 individuals for whom vaccination status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years), the 5 largest statewide epidemics had substantial proportions (range, 24%-45%) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. However, several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations, indicating waning immunity. Nine reports (describing 12 outbreaks) provided detailed vaccination data on unimmunized cases; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59% through 93% of unvaccinated individuals were intentionally unvaccinated. 
 
 Conclusions and Relevance A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some populations.","– Wondering what's behind recent outbreaks of measles and whooping cough in the US? Perhaps not surprisingly, a new study published in JAMA finds that people who don't vaccinate—for non-medical reasons—contribute to the problem, Reuters reports. Since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, there have been 1,416 cases of the disease reported, and the study finds that more than half of those cases were in people who hadn't been vaccinated for measles. Detailed vaccination data was available for 970 of the measles cases, and 405 of them involved people who skipped vaccinations without a medical reason to do so. Researchers also looked at more than 10,000 cases of whooping cough in patients with known vaccination status and found similar, though somewhat less dramatic, results. In the pertussis cases, when looking at the five biggest statewide epidemics since 1977, 24% to 45% of the people affected were completely or partially unvaccinated. And in looking at the pertussis cases for which detailed vaccine data was available, 59% to 93% of cases were in people who were intentionally unvaccinated (as opposed to unvaccinated for medical reasons.) “If there are a high number of susceptible or unvaccinated individuals in the community the risk of getting infected—even for vaccinated children—goes up,"" says the study's senior author, because most vaccines are not 100% effective. Up to 2% of people who are fully vaccinated for pertussis and 3% of people who are fully vaccinated for measles are still at risk of getting the disease. Non-medical vaccine exemptions don't fully explain the resurgence of measles and whooping cough (researchers also found evidence of waning immunity against pertussis, for example), but another researcher says the study finds that ""individuals who refuse vaccines not only put themselves at risk for disease,"" but others too.","<pad> More than half of 1,416 measles cases reported in the U.S. since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000 were for people with no history of measles vaccination, the analysis found.</s>",0.18652849485570083,0.055172411776218865,0.1658031062546646

 Gov. John Hickenlooper also credited security procedures adopted after the 1999 massacre at nearby Columbine High School for helping put a quick end to the Arapahoe High School shooting by Karl Pierson, an 18-year-old student who shot Claire Davis at point-blank range before killing himself. 
 
 ""We all have to keep Claire in our thoughts and prayers,"" he told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Davis is hospitalized at Littleton Adventist Hospital. 
 
 Davis is in critical condition and stable, but she is in a coma, her family said in a statement issued on the hospital's Facebook page Sunday. 
 
 ""The first responders got Claire to the right place, at the right time,"" the family said. They also praised the care she was receiving and expressed thanks for the outpouring of prayers and support. 
 
 About 500 classmates held a candlelight vigil Saturday for Davis, who was sitting with a friend near the school library when she was shot in the head. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson has said investigators think she was shot at random by Pierson, who had gone into the school looking for a teacher with whom he had a dispute. 
 
 Pierson may have been nursing a grudge against the teacher _ a librarian and head of the school debate team _ since September. Pierson was on the team and had been disciplined by the librarian for reasons yet to be disclosed, the sheriff said. He said Pierson threatened that teacher in September and came to the school Friday intending to harm him and inflict numerous other casualties. 
 
 Pierson excelled at speech and debate and was passionate about the team, friends said. They described him as a smart student who apparently didn't shirk from confrontations in class. 
 
 ""He's a funny kid. He's smart. He's in the Eagle Scouts, a very intelligent kid. Did not like being wrong,"" said August Clary, who was a friend of Pierson. ""If you're arguing with him, it's going to be, that's a feat if you win an argument against him."" 
 
 ""He would not be afraid to tell someone how he feels,"" said Zach Runberg, 18, a senior in Pierson's English class. 
 
 Pierson legally bought a shotgun on Dec. 6 at a local store, and he purchased ammunition the morning of the shootings. He managed to ignite a Molotov cocktail inside the school library before he killed himself as a fast-acting school security officer, a deputy sheriff, closed in, Robinson said. 
 
 That officer's aggressive response prevented more casualties, Robinson said. It's a tactic adopted nationwide after Columbine, in which first responders cordoned off the school before pursuing two student gunmen inside. The two killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. 
 
 ""It's nice to see how well the system worked. It's a remarkable improvement from before. This could have been much, much worse,"" Hickenlooper said. 
 
 After the Aurora, Colo., theater shootings and the Newtown, Conn., school shootings, Colorado's Democrat-led legislature this year implemented gun control measures that limited the size of ammunition magazines and instituted universal background checks. Colorado also appropriated more than $20 million for mental health hotlines and local crisis centers. 
 
 The measures were intended to address violence associated with so-called assault rifles, not shotguns that are widely owned for hunting and sport. 
 
 Hickenlooper acknowledged the latest shooting raised again questions about guns and violence. But he noted that Pierson ""didn't seem to exhibit any signs of mental illness,"" and he cautioned that the investigation was in its early stages. 
 
 ""Everyone in Colorado is asking the same questions,"" the governor said. ""On the one hand there is a deeply held conviction for the freedoms laid out in the Second Amendment, but also a very, very strong conviction about the safety of children and the safety of the community."" 
 
 Friday's shooting, he said, ""defies any explanation, and you know we are searching for some pattern.""

 Associated Press writer P. Solomon Banda contributed to this report. ||||| Students at Arapahoe High School should have been studying for finals Monday, powering through their last week of classes before Christmas break. 
 
 Instead, authorities continue to walk the school's hallways, piecing together the 80 seconds that terrified a community and left Claire Davis in a coma, fighting for her life. 
 
 Davis remained in critical condition Sunday evening, according to a statement from her family, who praised first responders and asked the community to continue thinking of and praying for the 17-year-old. 
 
 Claire Davis (Provided by Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office) 
 
 The senior was shot point-blank in the head Friday after she found herself in the path of Karl Pierson, who had fired several random rounds in the hallway before he shot Davis. Pierson, an 18-year-old senior, stormed into the school at about 12:30 p.m., carrying a pump-action shotgun, a bandolier of ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails. 
 
 Seconds later, Pierson turned the gun on himself. Officers found his body in a corner of the library.

 Pierson bought the shotgun days before, part of a plot to avenge a grudge he had against the school's librarian and debate coach, Tracy Murphy. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson told The Post on Sunday that investigators have spoken with Murphy extensively and are working to understand the relationship between the two. 
 
 ""We're beginning to better define that, but at this point in time it's not something we're going to talk about,"" Robinson said. 
 
 Robinson and Gov. John Hickenlooper have credited the swift response by a deputy sheriff working as the school's resource officer during the shooting. 
 
 ""This could have been much, much worse,"" Hickenlooper told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" 
 
 Hickenlooper also visited Davis and her family Sunday. 
 
 ""We all have to keep Claire in our thoughts and prayers,"" he said. 
 
 More than 1,000 of Davis' classmates and other community members gathered at the high school's track Sunday to pray for and support Davis. The crowd, huddled together in black and gold, came to offer prayers, give hugs and try to understand why. 
 
 ""It helps to see everyone's faces, to give them hugs,"" 14-year-old freshman Nick Atencio said. ""It still has all of us reeling. It's important that we all come together."" 
 
 Students stood in groups, and when words failed, hugs were used instead. Parents also came together, holding back tears as they described the short, terrifying text messages their children sent them from inside dark, quiet classrooms. 
 
 For many parents, the messages that were sent to reassure them — ""I'm OK,"" ""We're hiding and waiting,"" ""I love you"" — turned into rattling uncertainty. 
 
 ""It's going to be hard when we have to go back in there,"" Atencio said, staring at the entrance Pierson used Friday. ""I don't know what to expect. But it's a step we're all going to have to take together."" 
 
 Balloons and well-wishes for shooting victim Claire Davis, 17, are attached to a fence along Dry Creek Road near Arapahoe High School on Sunday. 
 
 School officials are working to set up times when students may come and collect their belongings. 
 
 But the trauma of Friday's shooting will reverberate long past when students return to school and beyond the school's walls, said Dr. David Schonfeld, director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement in Philadelphia. Schonfeld traveled to Colorado to work with students after the 2006 shooting at Platte Canyon High School, during which 16-year-old Emily Keyes was killed, and the shootings at the Aurora movie theater, where a gunman killed 12 people and injured 70 others in July 2012. 
 
 Less than an hour's drive to the movie theater and just miles from Columbine High School, where two students killed 12 students and one teacher in 1999, the shooting at Arapahoe High School is likely to spark memories of trauma for those affected by past events. The emotional toll also may cause overwhelming feelings of grief for members of the community, Schonfeld said. 
 
 Students and staff members who were at the school Friday will experience a range of emotions, Schonfeld said. Many may begin to place blame on themselves, either for failing to stop the shooting or predict it. 
 
 ""Whenever anything bad happens, people feel badly. But they also wonder what they did that was bad,"" Schonfeld said. ""A lot of this comes from the sense that people would rather accept blame for what happened than to realize it's completely out of their control."" 
 
 The Littleton Public School District has made counseling available for students. 
 
 On Sunday, students worked to comfort each other, including Davis. 
 
 Students hung a Christmas stocking for Davis and left notes at the tribute forming along the school's south fence. Their message — and hope — could be seen a block away. 
 
 ""Pray for Claire.""

 The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| NBC News Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson holds a picture of Claire Davis the 17-year-old student that was shot during a briefing Saturday, Dec. 14, 2013, at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo. 
 
 The 17-year-old girl shot point-blank in the head at a Colorado high school — who is being described as ""one of the nicest people"" — is in a coma and in critical condition, her family said Sunday. 
 
 Claire Esther Davis, a senior at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo., was wounded Friday in an 80-second attack by student gunman Karl Halverson Pierson, 18, who walked in the building packing a shotgun and a grudge over being benched on the debate team, police said. 
 
 The victim's family had previously said she suffered severe head trauma, but provided more details on her condition Sunday and thanked emergency workers who rushed her to the hospital. 
 
 ""Claire remains in critical condition. She is stable, but is in a coma,"" they said in a statement released through Littleton Adventist Hospital. 
 
 ""The first responders got Claire to the right place, at the right time, and the doctors and hospital staff are doing a wonderful job taking care of her. 
 
 ""We appreciate your continued good thoughts and prayers, and will provide updates as her condition improves."" 
 
 Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said Claire was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and that the motive for the shooting was retaliation against a staff member. 
 
 Karl Pierson had grown angry and made threatening remarks before he shot a student and himself in a Colorado high school. NBC's Ron Mott reports. 
 
 Debate team captain Joe Redmond said Pierson had grown angrier and angrier in recent weeks, and the target of his ire was debate coach and school librarian Tracy Murphy. 
 
 ""Speech and debate was his life and the fact that he wasn't there crushed him a little bit and made him really tense and angry,"" Redmond told NBC News. 
 
 ""Karl and Murphy did not get along and whatever it was escalated to a death threat. 
 
 ""I did try to help him and didn't get to him,"" Redmond added. ""No one was able to get to him. At the end of the day, that’s what happened."" 
 
 Pierson showed up at school at midday Friday with a pump-action shotgun, ammunition strapped to his chest, a machete and Molotov cocktails — and headed for the library. 
 
 Alerted to the threat, Murphy left the building, which police praised as a tactical move to lure Pierson outside. 
 
 Pierson fired one round down a hallway and then shot Claire, who just happened to be sitting nearby with a friend. He killed himself as a security officer closed in on him, police said. 
 
 ""His intent was evil and his evil intent was to harm multiple individuals,"" the sheriff said. 
 
 Redmond said he was trying to reconcile the cold-blooded crime with the teenager he knew. 
 
 ""It's indefensible what he did,"" he said. 
 
 ""The Karl that I knew was a good person but obviously the Karl who came into the school on Friday was not."" 
 
 Murphy was not hurt. A statement from the Littleton Public Schools he had ""asked asked that we share his and his family's concern for all of the victims of this tragedy."" 
 
 Meanwhile, Arapahoe students are praying for Claire, who was described as outgoing, athletic and an excellent student. She loves horses and recently placed second in an equestrian competition, The Denver Post reported, 
 
 A neighbor told the newspaper Claire is also the best babysitter in the community. 
 
 ""She took care of our 5-year-old,"" said one man. ""She was well-loved. I believe she wanted to go into nursing — I know she had already been accepted to a number of colleges already."" 
 
 Fellow student Avery Griggs, a sophomore, said she is ""one of the nicest people I've met at Arapahoe."" 
 
 ""She is amazing and so sweet,"" Avery told the Post. 
 
 Friends and well-wishers posted prayers on Twitter, and some students collected money to help pay for her medical expenses. 
 
 ""I feel like it's going to make us a stronger senior class and school as a whole,"" Chris Davis, an Arapahoe senior who helped organize the fundraising effort.

178,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's main opposition coalition will not join a national dialogue on Monday called by President Mohamed Mursi because the proposal was not genuine and the group will only attend future talks if a list of conditions are met, members said. 
 
 Mursi invited his allies and rivals to talks at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Monday to try to resolve a political crisis and end violence on the streets that erupted during anti-government protests. Five days of unrest has led to 50 deaths. 
 
 The National Salvation Front, which rejected a similar call for dialogue last year during another spasm of unrest, saw the Islamist leader's call as ""cosmetic and not substantive"", said leading member of the coalition Mohamed ElBaradei. 
 
 ""We will not go to the dialogue today,"" ElBaradei told a news conference after the Front's members met in Cairo to discuss the invitation. 
 
 ""We will send a message to the Egyptian people and the president of the republic about what we think are the essentials for dialogue. If he agrees to them, we are ready for dialogue."" 
 
 The coalition's conditions included a demand that Mursi accept responsibility for the bloodshed and agree to form a government of national salvation, echoing previously unmet demands by the opposition. 
 
 ""We have accepted dialogue (in the past) and went to the president in his office and spoke to him,"" said leftist firebrand politician Hamdeen Sabahy. ""We did not refuse dialogue. But the result was he issued an oppressive decree."" 
 
 Opposition politicians were enraged late last year when Mursi issued a decree awarding himself extra powers that the president's allies said were essential to help push Egypt's transition forward. Rivals saw it as a blatant power grab. 
 
 Opposition politicians were particularly angered that they had not been given any indication of Mursi's plans for such a sweeping move in their individual talks with him shortly before the decree was issued. 
 
 After that decree, Mursi fast-tracked an Islamist-tinged constitution through a referendum, further enraging his opponents who accused him of reneging on his pledged to be a president for all Egyptians.

 Welcome to Middle East Live. 
 
 Here's a roundup of the latest developments: 
 
 Egypt 
 
 • President Mohamed Morsi has announced a state of emergency in three cities along Egypt's Suez Canal, following four days of civil unrest that have left at least 40 dead and over 500 injured. Port Said, Suez, and Ismailiya – the cities most affected by the violence – will be subject to a 30-day curfew lasting from 9pm to 6am every night, Morsi said in a surprise televised speech. Speaking to the Guardian, a spokesman for the opposition expressed frustration at the announcement, blaming the president's policies and inaction for the violence, and arguing that the state of emergency was too little, too late. 
 
 • Morsi also invited his opponents for a national dialogue meeting on Monday aimed at quelling the unrest. His officer said it was inviting leading politicians such as former presidential candidates Hamdeen Sabahy and Amr Moussa. 
 
 • The opposition has threatened to back further protests unless Morsi meets five new demands including reforms to the constitution and the formation of a new salvation government, Ahram Online reports. The National Salvation Front stressed that if their “legitimate” demands were not met in the coming days, the front would call on Egyptians to peacefully protest next Friday to topple the “invalid” constitution and to readopt temporarily the 1971 constitution. 
 
 • Has Egypt become ungovernable? asks the latest Arabist podcast. Journalist Ursula Lindsey says there is now no respect for the country's institutions, including the courts, as many turn to violence to influence decisions. 
 
 • At least 25 women have been sexually assaulted during the recent unrest in Cairo's Tahrir Square, according to local women's rights campaigners. In a typical attack, crowds of men quickly surround isolated women, groping them and attempting to remove their clothes. Some women have been stripped naked and one was raped, the campaigners said. 
 
 Syria 
 
 • Barack Obama has defended his decision not to intervene in Syria by suggesting that to do so would provoke further violence. Speaking to New Republic magazine, the US president said: ""In a situation like Syria, I have to ask: can we make a difference in that situation? Could it trigger even worse violence or the use of chemical weapons? What offers the best prospect of a stable post-Assad regime? And how do I weigh tens of thousands who've been killed in Syria versus the tens of thousands who are currently being killed in the Congo?"" In a separate interview with CBS he added: ""We do nobody a service when we leap before we look, where we ... take on things without having thought through all the consequences of it ... sometimes that we don't just shoot from the hip."" 
 
 • The Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, has said Bashar al-Assad's chances of retaining power in Syria are getting ""smaller and smaller"" every day, according to the transcript of an interview with CNN. ""I think that with every day, every week and every month the chances of his preservation are getting smaller and smaller,"" Medvedev was quoted as saying. 
 
 Israel and the Palestinian territories 
 
 • At least five unarmed young Palestinians, including a 21-year-old woman, have been shot dead by Israeli soldiers in 13 days since the start of the year, prompting mounting concern about the unwarranted use of live fire. A sixth was killed on his 17th birthday last month, and a seventh death this month is disputed by the Israeli military. The commander of the Israeli Defence Forces in the West Bank, Brigadier-General Hagai Mordechai, has ordered all commanders to reiterate to all soldiers the rules of engagement, a military spokesman told the Guardian. 
 
 Iran 
 
 • Security officials have raided at least four newspapers and arrested several journalists in what appears to be concerted action aimed at intimidating the media in advance of the presidential elections in June. Sources in Tehran said reformist newspapers Etemaad, Shargh, Bahar and Arman were targeted by a group of plainclothes officials who ransacked offices, filmed staff, confiscated documents and held several journalists. ||||| PORT SAID, Egypt — The police fired indiscriminately into the streets outside their besieged station, a group of protesters arrived with a crate of gasoline bombs, and others cheered a masked man on a motorcycle who arrived with a Kalashnikov. 
 
 The growing chaos along the vital canal zone showed little sign of abating on Monday as President Mohamed Morsi called out the army to try to regain control of three cities along the Suez Canal whose growing lawlessness is testing the integrity of the Egyptian state. 
 
 In Port Said, street battles reached a bloody new peak with a death toll over three days of at least 45, with at least five more protesters killed by bullet wounds, hospital officials said. 
 
 President Morsi had already declared a monthlong state of emergency here and in the other canal towns of Suez and Ismailia, applying a law that virtually eliminates due process protections against abuse by the police. Angry crowds burned tires and hurled rocks at the police. And the police, with little training and less credibility, hunkered down behind barrages of tear gas, birdshot and occasional bullets. ||||| Police have fired tear-gas at protesters in downtown Cairo, just hours after President Mohamed Morsi declared a state of emegency and a curfew in three Suez Canal cities. 
 
 Monday was the fifth consecutive day of street violence in Egypt. There were reports that one person was killed; he was not taking part in the protests, but was hit by a stray gunshot. 
 
 Protests began last week to mark the second anniversary of the revolution that toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak; nearly 50 people have been killed so far. 
 
 The cabinet, meanwhile, approved a draft law which would allow Morsi to deploy the army on the streets to ""participate with the police in preserving security and protecting vital establishments."" The law still must be ratified by the upper house of parliament; it would last until after the next legislative elections, tentatively scheduled for April. 
 
 Morsi delivered a televised address on Sunday night and announced the emergency measures in Port Said, Ismailia and Suez. A curfew will take effect on Monday from 9:00pm local time (19:00 GMT) to 6:00am (04:00 GMT); he warned that more action would be taken to stem the violence. 
 
 ""I have said I am against any emergency measures but I have said that if I must stop bloodshed and protect the people then I will act,"" he said. 
 
 He also called for dialogue with leading politicians starting on Monday to resolve the situation. 
 
 Port Said deaths 
 
 Seven people were shot dead and hundreds were injured in Port Said on Sunday during the funerals of at least 30 people killed during clashes in the city on the previous day. 
 
 ""Down, down Morsi, down down the regime that killed and tortured us!"" people in Port Said chanted as the coffins of those killed on Saturday were carried through the streets. 
 
 In Port Said, Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh said military helicopters that had been overhead during the funeral could also be heard during Morsi's speech. 
 
 ""I dont see how these decisions will instil any confidence in the people,"" Rageh said, referring to the president's decision to impose a state of emergency. 
 
 She said that immediate reaction in Port Said was one of mockery and scepticism with many asking why the three canal cities had been singled out. 
 
 ""The people [in Port Said] feel that there was a complete state of collapse especially after riots today, particularly with tear gas being fired into the funerals,"" she said. 
 
 Protesters defiant 
 
 Several hundred people protested in Ismailia, Suez and Port Said after the announcement. 
 
 Activists in the three cities pledged to defy the curfew in protest at the decision. 
 
 On Sunday night, Morsi’s office issued a statement inviting political supporters and opponents for a national dialogue on Monday at 6:00pm (16:00 GMT) at the presidential palace in Cairo. 
 
 The spokesman for Egypt's main opposition coalition said after Morsi's speech that the move was ""expected"" and said he wanted more details about an invitation for dialogue with top politicians. 
 
 ""Of course we feel the president is missing the real problem on the ground which is his own policies,"" Dawoud told the Reuters news agency. 
 
 ""His call to implement emergency law was an expected move given what is going on, namely thuggery and criminal actions."" 
 
 Hamdeen Sabbahi, a leftist politician and opposition leader, said that he would not attend any negotiations ""unless the bloodshed stops and the people's demands are met"". 
 
 Mohamed ElBaradei, a leader of the NSF, said in a statement on Twitter that the dialogue was ""a waste of time"". 
 
 Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch in Cairo said a state of emergency reintroduced laws that gave police sweeping powers of arrest ""purely because [people] look suspicious"". 
 
 ""It is a classic knee-jerk reaction to think the emergency law will help bring security,"" she said. ""It gives so much discretion to the Ministry of Interior that it ends up causing more abuse which in turn causes more anger.""","– Despite President Mohamed Morsi declaring a state of emergency yesterday, protests are raging in Cairo and other parts of Egypt for a fifth consecutive day today, the New York Times reports. Marchers in Port Said, one of three provinces where Morsi declared a curfew, said they no longer recognize his authority and called on everyone to ignore the curfew. Opposition groups have called for more protests throughout Egypt today to mark the two-year anniversary of the ""Day of Rage,"" a brutal day of clashes during the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. Protests began last week to mark the two-year anniversary of the uprising, then grew over the weekend after 21 people involved in a soccer riot were sentenced to death. In addition to the state of emergency, one of the most hated Mubarak-era laws still in effect, al-Jazeera reports that Egypt's Cabinet has given the army the right to arrest civilians and act alongside police; the upper house of parliament must still ratify the draft law. Morsi has invited opposition leaders to a ""national dialogue"" tonight, and initial reports indicated they would participate. But now the Guardian reports that the National Salvation Front, the country's opposition coalition, has rejected the plan.

179,"Meriam Ibrahim’s case sparked international outrage after she was sentenced to death for “apostasy” and imprisoned while heavily pregnant with her second child. 
 
 When the 27-year-old went into labour she was refused access to a hospital, instead placed on a table with her legs still shackled. 
 
 Speaking for the first time about the ordeal on 27 May, she told CNN: “I was only thinking about my children and how I was going to give birth. I was most scared of giving birth in prison. 
 
 “I gave birth chained,” she said. “Not cuffs but chains on my legs. I couldn't even open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table.” 
 
 In this file image from an undated video Meriam Ibrahim, sitting next to her 18-month-old son Martin, holds her newborn baby girl as an NGO visits her in a room at a prison in Khartoum Ms Ibrahim said that doctors had told her the circumstances of her birth and treatment in prison meant her daughter had been left physically disabled, with potentially long-lasting consequences. 
 
 “Something has happened to the baby,” she said. “I don't know in the future whether she'll need support to walk or not.” 
 
 Ms Ibrahim remains in limbo at the US embassy in Sudan, after the authorities stopped her leaving the country over charges travel documents provided to her, her husband and two children were “forged”. 
 
 She told CNN: “How can my paperwork be wrong? My paperwork came from the embassy. It's 100 per cent correct and it was approved by the South Sudan ambassador and the American ambassador.” 
 
 While in prison, Ms Ibrahim said she was abused and harassed by guards and other inmates over her faith, and visited by a series of different sheikhs trying to persuade her to convert. Meriam Ibrahim was later detained trying to flee Sudan 
 
 Despite being brought up a Christian, a court in Sudan determined that she was actually a Muslim because her father was a Muslim. It therefore ruled it illegal for her to marry her Christian husband Daniel Wani under Sudanese laws. 
 
 Meriam Ibrahim with her husband Daniel Wani US officials say diplomats are now trying to arrange for Ms Ibrahim and her family to depart from Sudan. 
 
 Mr Wani, who holds American citizenship as well as being a citizen of South Sudan, said authorities accused his wife of forging the documents as a pretext to justify her detention “without an arrest warrant”. 
 
 “Does it make sense that we try to fly all the way to the United States with forged passports?” he said. They were arrested and detained for two days at Khartoum airport where the family was departing the country, a day after Sudan's Cassation Court overturned a death sentence against Ms Ibrahim and ordered her release. ||||| (CNN) -- What a week it's been for Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, the Sudanese Christian woman who initially faced a death sentence after refusing to renounce her faith. 
 
 She thought she was finally free Monday after a higher court ordered her release. A day later, she was back in police custody. 
 
 Now she faces a new charge, accused of falsifying travel documents, and has taken refuge in a safe house in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, amid concerns for her security. 
 
 In a phone interview with CNN, Ibrahim spoke of the ordeal of giving birth while in prison, her fears for her family and how she is facing a future full of unknowns. 
 
 Asked how she felt in prison, refused access to a hospital as the birth of her child neared, Ibrahim said, ""I was only thinking about my children and how I was going to give birth. I was mostly scared of giving birth in prison."" 
 
 The 27-year-old had reason to be alarmed. 
 
 ""I gave birth chained. Not cuffs but chains on my legs. I couldn't open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table. I wasn't attached to the table,"" she said. 
 
 Doctors fear that the circumstances of the baby's birth may have lasting consequences. 
 
 ""I don't know in the future whether she'll need support to walk or not,"" said Ibrahim. 
 
 She her husband, American Daniel Wani, were freed from custody Thursday after having been detained two days earlier upon arriving at the airport in Khartoum. They were trying to fly with their baby and toddler son to the United States. 
 
 Now they are waiting to see what happens in light of the latest allegations against Ibrahim, of traveling with falsified documents and giving false information. 
 
 ""I'm currently in a safe place. It's definitely safe but not comfortable,"" Ibrahim said. 
 
 Sudanese Christian woman is in U.S. Embassy in Sudan 
 
 Persecuted as a 'nonbeliever' 
 
 Ibrahim's ordeal started when one of her relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. 
 
 A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan. She was also charged with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. 
 
 Convicted while about eight months pregnant, she gave birth about two weeks later in a women's hospital in Khartoum. 
 
 She insists she has never been a Muslim -- and says she was persecuted as a Christian while in prison. 
 
 ""I've always been Christian. I couldn't have been Muslim with the things they say and the way they treat me -- with a different sheikh coming to speak to me every other time and women in prison saying all sorts of things, like 'don't eat the nonbeliever's food' and calling me a Christian,"" she said. ""There was all this talk and even the officers in the prison would join (in)."" 
 
 A string of people, from politicians to humanitarian workers to lawmakers, came to visit while she was locked up with promises to help, she said, but none offered any real assistance. Eventually, following weeks of international controversy over her conviction for apostasy and adultery, it was overturned. 
 
 Ibrahim: My paperwork was '100% correct' 
 
 Now, the Sudanese authorities have accused Ibrahim of trying to leave without the correct paperwork. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. 
 
 But she is adamant that she ""never forged any papers"" and was entitled to travel on the documents she had. 
 
 ""How can my paperwork be wrong? My paperwork came from the embassy. It's 100% correct and it was approved by the South Sudan ambassador and the American ambassador,"" she said. 
 
 ""The South Sudanese embassy took responsibility and released the papers. It's in my right to use the papers and have a South Sudanese passport because my husband is a South Sudanese citizen. He has an American passport and South Sudanese passport."" 
 
 Ibrahim had also been given a U.S. visa. 
 
 She described as ""terrorizing"" the way that Sudanese police officers took her and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, from the VIP departures hall as they waited to check in for their flight. 
 
 ""We were scared and wondering what was wrong. They locked us in that room for four to five hours and the whole time we were trying to figure out what the problem was,"" she said. 
 
 She claims that the charges were filed in court before the police even investigated the claims against her and her husband. When they finally figured out what the alleged offense was, she was shocked, Ibrahim said. 
 
 ""I can't even decide what I should do right now. I want to travel but at the same time I don't want to travel. But the state I'm in right now means that I'm forced to. There's a new problem every day about me leaving."" 
 
 Asked if the authorities were trying to make life difficult for her, Ibrahim replied, ""I don't know what their problem is."" 
 
 Faith in her husband 
 
 Ibrahim simply hopes that she can leave, together with her husband and their children. 
 
 ""That's exactly what I want. Not anything more,"" she said. 
 
 But despite her experiences so far, she insists that she is not scared. She will put her faith in her husband, Ibrahim said, and count on him to protect the family. 
 
 ""If anything happens to us, he's responsible for us in the face of everyone else. This is protection and better for us. I'll go wherever he takes us, it's not a problem.""

 Why marrying for love should never mean death ||||| Ibrahim said she gave birth chained to the floor of her cell and could not open her legs 
 
 Meriam Ibrahim, the Christian Sudanese woman who was sentenced to death for apostasy, has said the baby daughter she gave birth to while shackled to the floor of her prison cell could be disabled. 
 
 Talking for the first time since she was released from prison last week – only to be detained as she and her family attempted to leave the country – Ibrahim, 27, said she gave birth in chains and could not open her legs. Asked if she was scared something would happen to the baby during the delivery, she replied: ""Something has happened to the baby … I don't know in the future whether she'll need support to walk or not."" 
 
 Describing how she felt when she was sentenced to death, Ibrahim said: ""I was only thinking about my children and how I was going to give birth. I was really scared of giving birth in prison."" 
 
 Ibrahim spoke by phone to CNN from what she described as a safe place – the US embassy in Khartoum – following her detention at the city's airport two days after her convictions for apostasy and adultery were quashed and she was released from prison. 
 
 ""To be honest, I'm really miserable. I left prison to bring together my children and settle down … and now there are protests against me in the streets,"" she said. 
 
 Ibrahim, her husband, Daniel Wani, who is a US citizen, and their two children were waiting to check in for a flight when they were stopped by 10 to 15 security officers, she said. 
 
 ""We were scared and wondering what was wrong. They locked us in that room for four to five hours and the whole time we were trying to figure out what the problem was,"" she said. 
 
 When the officials, who told Ibrahim they were from the National Intelligence and Security Service, questioned the couple, ""we realised that the problem was our travel documents"". 
 
 Ibrahim was accused of possessing forged travel documents, although South Sudan said it had issued the papers. 
 
 ""It's my right to use the papers and have a South Sudanese passport because my husband is a South Sudanese citizen. He has an American passport and South Sudanese passport,"" she said. ""I never forged any papers. I was given the papers by the South Sudanese embassy because I deserve it. It's my right to have papers like these because my husband is South Sudanese."" 
 
 She appeared unclear about her intentions. ""I can't even decide what I should do right now. I want to travel but at the same time I don't want to travel … There's a new problem every day about me leaving."" 
 
 Her lawyer, Elshareef Mohammed, earlier said the family were boarding a plane to the US when they were detained. 
 
 Ibrahim, the daughter of a Muslim man and a Christian woman, was convicted of apostasy despite insisting to the court that she had been brought up as a Christian since her father left the family when she was six. Her marriage to Wani was declared invalid and she was convicted of adultery and sentenced to 100 lashes. 
 
 Her convictions, sentences and detention in Omdurman's women's prison while heavily pregnant and with her toddler son incarcerated alongside her caused international outrage. More than a million people backed an Amnesty International campaign to get her released. 
 
 ""I've always been Christian,"" she told CNN. ""I couldn't have been Muslim and not go back, with all the things they said and the way they treat me – with a different sheikh coming to speak to me every other time and women in prison saying all sorts of things like 'don't eat the nonbeliever's food' and calling me a Christian.

180,"A systematic sampling of the complete arthropod fauna in the interior of homes and an understanding of the role that interior microhabitats play in determining the assemblage of arthropod communities are the first steps toward revealing ecological dynamics in a vastly understudied system ( Baz & Monserrat, 1999 ; Dunn et al., 2013 ). What are the most prevalent arthropod groups found in houses and how common are they among homes and rooms? Here we explored the composition of overall arthropod diversity, including both pest and non-pest species, in human dwellings. Through surveying 50 free-standing houses located in the North Carolina Piedmont region, we identified and characterized the overall diversity of arthropods found within these homes. 
 
 Research on indoor arthropod communities has focused almost exclusively on pests, with a particular emphasis on those of medical and economic importance such as cockroaches, termites, bed bugs, fleas, and mosquitoes ( Committee on Urban Pest Management et al., 1980 ; Robinson, 2005 ). Unlike the species that threaten or bother us, very little is known about the myriad other arthropod species, many of them inconspicuous (and even unnoticed), that live with humans. The true interactions between these other species and humans—be it beneficial, neutral, or negative—remain largely unknown, as does their prevalence and distribution. In fact, a comprehensive survey of arthropod life in contemporary human houses has never before been carried out. 
 
 In contrast to the simple dwellings early humans used, modern western houses are perceived of as being an environment largely devoid of animal life. However, arthropods thrive in homes, as evidenced by today’s multi-billion dollar pest control industry. Houses today host many of the same pest groups found in archeological sites (see ‘Results’), yet today’s arthropod communities also reflect aspects of society’s modernization. For example, with the advent of indoor plumbing, dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) are less prevalent indoors (as shown in this study), but drain-dwelling moth flies (Psychodidae) are likely more so. Also, as human society became more globalized through travel and trade, arthropod species that are closely associated with humans and their homes, such as the house fly ( Musca domestica L.; Legner & McCoy, 1966 ), German cockroach ( Blattella germanica L.), and fruit fly (or vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster Meigen; Keller, 2007 ) obtained worldwide distributions and, in some cases, even lack wild populations (e.g., the German cockroach; Roth, 1985 ; Booth et al., 2010 ). The influence of human society and our changing domiciles on the evolution of specific arthropod lineages is evident. 
 
 Insects, spiders and their relatives have been living and evolving with humans for all of our history. It has been proposed that many arthropod species that are now associated with human houses were originally cave dwellers (e.g., bed bugs: Cimicidae) ( Balvín et al., 2012 ). Evidence of arthropod vectors in caves inhabited by prehistoric people ca. 26,000 years ago suggests that pestiferous arthropods, such as blood-feeding kissing bugs (Reduviidae: Triatominae), lived alongside our ancestors ( Araújo et al., 2009 ). Among the first examples of cave art is a depiction of a camel cricket (Rhaphidophoridae) ( Chopard, 1928 ; Belles, 1997 ). 
 
 For as long as humans have lived in fixed habitations there have been other organisms that dwell alongside us. We share our living spaces with a variety of invited and uninvited guests spanning the tree of life, from large vertebrates (e.g., pets and livestock) to microorganisms ( Martin et al., 2015 ). The most diverse and abundant group of multicellular life found in homes, as well as on Earth more generally, is represented by arthropods. 
 
 We classified rooms into 6 categories based on their similarities of features and use: attics, basements (including finished and unfinished basements, and crawl spaces), bathrooms (including bathrooms and laundry rooms), bedrooms (including bedrooms, offices, and libraries), common rooms (including living rooms, dining rooms, and attached hallways), and kitchens (including kitchens and pantries); rooms not conforming to one of the categories were classified as “other” and were excluded from Table 1 . We estimated diversity of families based on the complete list of families acquired over each sampled house using the Chao2 Estimator with 1,000 randomization runs in EstimateS ( Colwell, 2013 ). We compared total dust mite abundance in each sample with the floor type on which it was collected. Some samples were collected on carpet, while others were on bare surfaces. Because the data were not normally distributed, we analyzed the differences between samples with different floor types using a Kruskal–Wallis test. All analyses were done in R 3.1.2 ( R Core Team, 2015 ). 
 
 We identified all specimens to family level except when specimens were badly damaged or required additional methods for identification (e.g., slide mounting of mites and other taxa). We further determined genera and species when possible, but many specimens could not be identified to such a level for several reasons including, but not limited to, being damaged, being an unidentifiable sex (e.g., female Sciaridae) or an unidentifiable life stage (e.g., larvae), or being a group that is understudied or lacking good diagnostic keys. As such, our approach produced a very conservative list of morphotaxa for each room in the house and hereafter we call these morphospecies; this type of characterization has been found to be effective in comparing species richness and turnover between sites ( Oliver & Beattie, 2002 ). The taxonomic identity of morphospecies was not compared between rooms within homes due to limitations on time, space (storage of voucher specimens) and diagnostic expertise, thus the true number of morphospecies per house and among all houses was not definitively determined. Thus, a conservative (or assumed minimum) estimate of morphospecies richness per house was created by taking the maximum number of morphospecies from the room containing the highest number of morphospecies, for each family, and summing the total. This is in contrast to a maximum estimate of morphospecies richness which was the total sum of all morphospecies from all rooms within a house; this maximum corresponds to the case in which no two rooms held the same morphospecies. We assume the true diversity falls between our minimum and maximum estimates. All voucher specimens are housed in vials of ethanol in the laboratory of RRD (Department of Biological Sciences, NCSU) for use in further ecological, genetic, and microbiological studies. Specimens will be deposited in the insect museum at NCSU (Department of Entomology) when permanently housed. 
 
 We sampled dust mites from the middle of the master bedroom floor, regardless of floor type, in a 0.5 m 2 area. To collect mites, we used a vacuum that was adapted to use specimen cups modified with a screen bottom composed of mesh with 0.0055 inch (0.1397 mm) openings, small enough to allow air to pass through but not mites. We stored all samples in 95% ethanol until they were sorted and quantified. Because of time and specimen handling constraints, only five individuals from five randomly-selected samples were identified. 
 
 We (trained entomologists) performed a visual inspection of each room and collected specimens by hand using forceps, aspirators and entomological nets. Only visible surfaces, including those accessible under and behind furniture, around baseboards, ceilings, and on shelves and other surfaces were sampled. We collected all arthropods or putative arthropods, including those from spider webs; both living and dead arthropods were collected in this manner into vials containing 95% ethanol. We did not collect all specimens of a given arthropod species. We designated each distinct room or area and labeled its vial with the room name (as best identified), floor type, and number of windows and doors to the outside of the house; doors between rooms were not quantified. We identified floor types as wood (including laminates, hardwoods, and other wood-like surfaces), linoleum (tiles or otherwise), tile (stone, concrete, or otherwise; not including linoleum) or carpet. The presence of small or large rugs on other surfaces was noted as well. Typical room categories included kitchens, bedrooms (sometimes specified as offices/dens because of their lack of running water, but not receiving the same amount of traffic as common areas), bathrooms, laundry/utility rooms (denoted when a washer and dryer were present), and common areas. Common areas consisted of large open areas that were not easily categorized, usually including dining rooms, living rooms, front rooms, hallways, etc. Closets were sampled and included with the room in which they opened. When a room was present on a floor other than the first/main floor, house level was recorded (e.g., “2nd Floor Bathroom”). All rooms inside the house were sampled in the manner described above except for attics and crawl spaces, which were sampled less thoroughly: only the entrance of each was sampled within a 2 m radius. The limited sampling method for these areas was deemed necessary for the safety of those collecting the specimens (i.e., to avoid high summer temperatures in attics and confined areas in crawl spaces). Screened porches, decks, garages, detached sheds/structures, and closets accessible only from the outside were not sampled. 
 
 We solicited volunteers owning or renting free-standing homes in Raleigh and neighboring areas of North Carolina, USA. The study area is located in the Piedmont of the state and characterized by red clay soils and deciduous/pine forests (with meadows and aquatic/semi-aquatic systems interspersed) among various urban and suburban development ( Fig. 1 ). We randomly selected 50 homes/volunteers to visit from among participants who filled out an online questionnaire about the characteristics of their household and behavior of its residents. All homes included in the study were within a 30 mile radius of Raleigh’s center (35.7719°N, 78.6389°W). Each home was visited once between May and October 2012. Upon arrival, volunteers were informed of the procedures and process for sampling arthropods and asked to sign a consent form ( Supplemental Information 1 ). 
 
 Arthropods were found on every level of the home and in all room types. Only 5 rooms (non-attics) had no arthropod specimens collected (four bathrooms, one bedroom). Six arthropod orders dominated houses, comprising 81% of the diversity in an average room: Diptera (true flies, 23%), Coleoptera (beetles, 19%), Araneae (spiders, 16%), Hymenoptera (predominantly ants, 15%), Psocodea (book lice, 4%), and Hemiptera (true bugs, 4%) ( Fig. 5 ). Eight additional orders made up another 15% of the diversity (Blattodea, Collembola, Lepidoptera, Isopoda, Zygentoma, Polydesmida, Orthoptera, and Acari), while all remaining orders comprised a total of 4% of the overall diversity ( Fig. 5 ). The percentage of rooms in which an arthropod was collected varied among taxa, as did their presence in rooms of different types ( Table 1 ). 
 
 Typical household pests were found in a minority of the homes, such as German cockroaches ( Blattella germanica : 6% of houses), subterranean termites (Rhinotermitidae: 28% of houses), and fleas (Pulicidae: 10% of houses); bed bugs ( Cimex lectularius Linnaeus) were not found during the study. Larger cockroaches (Blattidae), such as smoky brown ( Periplaneta fuliginosa (Serville)) and American cockroaches ( Periplaneta americana (Linnaeus)) were found in the majority of houses (74%). However, the American cockroach (which is the only of the two considered a true pest) was only recovered from three homes; smoky brown cockroaches made up the vast majority of large cockroaches collected. All pest species were less common than other more inconspicuous arthropods such as pillbugs (Armadillidiidae, 78%) and springtails (Entomobryidae, 78%). 
 
 While overall diversity was high, 12 frequently found families were identified in at least 80% of homes ( Fig. 4 ). Only four families were identified from 100% of houses sampled: cobweb spiders (Theridiidae), carpet beetles (Dermestidae), gall midge flies (Cecidomyiidae) and ants (Formicidae). Book lice (Liposcelididae) and dark-winged fungus gnats (Sciaridae) were found in 98% and 96% of homes, respectively. Nearly half of all families (five of 12) found in over 80% of homes were true flies (Diptera): fungus gnats (Sciaridae); mosquitoes (Culicidae); scuttle flies (Phoridae); non-biting midges (Chironomidae); and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae). 
 
 Twelve (12) families were represented in at least 80% of homes. For each family we present the common name and percentage of homes it was found in, followed in parentheses by the scientific family name and species level identification when possible. (A) cobweb spiders, 100% (Theridiidae; shown here Parasteatoda tepidariorum (Koch)); (B) carpet beetles, 100%, (Dermestidae; shown here Anthrenus larvae); (C) gall midges, 100% (Cecidomyiidae); (D) ants, 100% (Formicidae; shown here Monomorium minimum (Buckley)); (E) book lice, 98% (Liposcelididae); (F) dark-winged fungus gnats, 96% (Sciaridae); (G) cellar spiders, 84% (Pholcidae; shown here Pholcus sp.); (H) weevils, 82% (Curculionidae; shown here Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky)); (I) mosquitoes, 82% (Culicidae; shown here Aedes albopictus (Skuse)); (J) scuttle flies, 82% (Phoridae; shown here Dohrniphora incisuralis (Loew)); (K) leafhoppers, 82% (Cicadellidae; shown here Sibovia sp.); (L) non-biting midges, 80% (Chironomidae).

 The number of species collected by house is represented by the middle bar. The bottom limit is the minimum/conservative estimate of morphospecies by house which was calculated by taking the maximum number of morphospecies from the room containing the highest number of morphospecies, for each family, and summing the total The upper limit is the maximum possible of morphospecies within a house, with the assumption that each set of morphospecies within each room were unique from other rooms. Houses furthest to the left are the smallest in terms of square footage, and those furthest to the right are the largest. Houses ranged in size from 840 to 4,833 square feet. 
 
 We collected 24–128 families from each house, resulting in an average of 61.84 (s.d. = 23.24) distinct arthropod families per house and a total gamma diversity (across houses) of 304 families ( Fig. 2 ). One hundred and forty-nine (149) families were rare, collected from fewer than 10% of homes, 66 of which were found in just a single home. The number of families collected in a home was correlated with house size ( r 2 = 0.3, p = < 0.001). Conservative species estimates by home ranged from 32 to 211, with an average of 93.14 (s.d. = 42.34) morphospecies per house ( Fig. 3 ). Considering that our conservative species estimate assumes that rooms with the greatest number of morphospecies by family included all species from other rooms (which is almost certainly untrue), this number is likely much lower than the true number of species per house ( Fig. 3 ). 
 
 Houses in the study ranged from 840 to 4,833 square feet in area (mean = 2,072; median = 1,720) and were from seven to 94 years old (mean = 41.35; median = 30.5). During the course of sampling 554 rooms in the 50 homes, over 10,000 specimens were collected and identified. These specimens represented all four subphyla (Chelicerata, Myriapoda, “Crustacea,” and Hexapoda), as well as six classes, 34 orders and 304 families of arthropods ( Table 1 and Table S1 ). While we cannot determine the exact number of morphospecies that were collected, there were at least 579 morphospecies based on our most conservative estimates (calculated by summing the maximum number of morphospecies for each family ever found in a single room). 
 
 Discussion 
 
 As household pests and disease vectors, the indoor arthropods in our daily lives have had a substantial impact on human society both historically and today. Although extensive research has been done on a small number of arthropod pest species, the data presented herein represent the first comprehensive survey of the arthropod diversity collected from urban and suburban houses. In the absence of similar studies that could provide baseline data for comparison, our results are surprising both in terms of the prevalence of arthropods (virtually every room was occupied) and in terms of their diversity. 
 
 The diversity of arthropods found indoors extends far beyond commonly recognized species. We found that an individual house may have hundreds of arthropod species within it, with each house on average containing 62 families and a minimum estimate of 93 morphospecies. The true diversity among these 50 homes is undoubtedly much higher due to limitations of the minimum estimate (it assumes no species turnover between rooms), the presence of cryptic species and our sampling method that excluded areas behind walls, under heavy furniture, and in drawers and cabinets, all of which undoubtedly serve as potential refuges for additional arthropods. While sampling 50 homes did lead to a decrease in the estimated diversity of families, clearly there are still many other families and morphospecies that are yet to be recovered and characterized from homes (Fig. 2). 
 
 We found that four groups of arthropods dominate the average room: flies (23%), beetles (19%), spiders (16%) and hymenoptera (predominantly ants, 15%) (Fig. 5). Overall, there are more types of flies associated with human homes than any other group of animals. Some flies have evolved close associations with humans, while others (Chironomidae and Cecidomyiidae) may arrive in houses as part of ‘air plankton’; their presence indoors is more a reflection of their abundance outdoors than of the ecology inside homes. Despite their prevalence, flies represent only a small proportion of taxon-focused studies in the urban landscape (McIntyre, 2000). Recent studies have revealed new information on flies in urban landscapes, including 30 new scuttle fly species identified from urban Los Angeles (California, USA), indicating that the true diversity of these flies, and likely many other small fly groups, in human-developed areas is underestimated (Grimaldi et al., 2015; Hartop, Brown & Disney, 2015). 
 
 Book lice (Psocodea: Liposcelididae), were found to be among the most ubiquitous indoor arthropods (found in 49 of 50 houses). Book lice are close relatives of parasitic lice and have a long evolutionary history of living, among other places, in close association with birds, mammals and their nests (including those of primates; Grimaldi & Engel, 2005). As stored grain pests, fungus feeders, and scavengers, book lice thrive in indoor environments. Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel, for example, is a globally-distributed, anthropophilic species whose widespread success and resistance to control measures is in part due to its parthenogenesis, ability to disperse through air, wide diversity of diet, and resistance to starvation (Diaz-Montano et al., 2014). Book lice have become more common in houses in the United Kingdom over time (recovered from 14% of houses sampled in 1987 versus 30% in 1997; Turner & Bishop, 1998) and are more prevalent in areas of high humidity in houses in Spain (such as kitchens and bathrooms; Baz & Monserrat, 1999). However, perhaps due to North Carolina’s humid climate or our sampling methods, we found book lice distributed throughout houses. 
 
 Dust mites were found in the majority of homes (76%). Previous studies have found dust mites in 30–100% of sampled homes across the US (Arlian et al., 1992). Human association with dust mites may have been established with the origins of dense human settlements; dust mites likely shifted from the nests of synanthropic birds or rodents to human houses (Klimov & O’Connor, 2013). To control dust mite populations, it is often recommended to remove carpets because they provide protection, thermoinsulation, higher humidity, and trap the food on which these mites feed (Colloff, 1998). As expected, we found much higher dust mite abundance on carpeted surfaces, consistent with previous research. Yet, paradoxically, the house that had the single highest abundance of dust mites within our study had a wood floor. Humidity levels and vacuuming frequency, although unknown for this house, may explain the discrepancy. Characteristics of different wood floors, such as age and quality of build, could also affect mite abundance since gaps between boards can provide habitat for mite populations. 
 
 Because previous studies of indoor arthropods have largely focused on pest groups of economic and human health importance (e.g., Runstrom & Bennett, 1990; Colloff, 1998; How & Lee, 2010; Crissman et al., 2010), we expected common pests to be among the most frequently found groups of arthropods in the homes. In fact, we found a relative dearth of typical household pests. The only exception to this was the prevalence of the smoky brown cockroach, a species that is not truly considered pestiferous because it does not generally develop pest-level populations in homes due to its need for high humidity and moisture (Robinson, 2005). It may be that we collected more specimens of this species due to their intolerance and ultimate death within the homes. While the lack of many pest species could be an artifact of the sampling design (sampling for species occurrence rather than abundance, as well as sampling in free-standing homes rather than other forms of human habitation such as apartments, townhouses, etc.), it appears that the vast majority of arthropods that live among us cause no direct harm. Unfortunately, many insects and arthropods we collected are considered pests based solely on their presence in the home (i.e., nuisance invaders; Hahn & Ascerno, 1991; Cranshaw, 2011), despite having no direct impact on people or their possessions. 
 
 Many arthropods we identified from houses were unexpected—either in terms of the frequency with which they were found or because they are rarely found outdoors, much less indoors. Gall midges (Cecidomyiidae), although found in every house sampled, were not even mentioned among the over 2,000 species listed in a recent compilation of urban insects and arachnids (Robinson, 2005). Leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), as plant feeders, are not associated with the indoor biome (Robinson, 2005), yet were among the groups most frequently found in houses. Moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), on the other hand, were collected infrequently, making up only 2% of the average diversity in a room; this is disproportionate to their known overall diversity (the order comprising over 10% of described insect species; Heppner, 2008). Although ants (Formicidae) were expected and found in 100% of houses, further identification at the genus and species level revealed taxa that are not typically thought to occur in homes. Camel crickets (Rhaphidophoridae) are known basement dwellers in the Southeastern US, but our sampling confirmed previous reports that an invasive species, Diestrammena asynamora (Adelung) predominates over native species (Ceuthophilus spp.) (Epps et al., 2014). Other unexpected finds were ant-loving crickets (Myrmecophilidae), the smallest orthopterans (Whitman, 2008), which were found in homes with ant infestations; beetles from the relatively rare suborder Archostemata (families Cupedidae and Micromalthidae); and a larval beaded lacewing (Berothidae), a rarely seen neuropteran known to live within termite nests where they paralyze termites with an airborne chemical before feeding on them (Johnson & Hagen, 1981). 
 
 Of the arthropods we found that live out a portion of their life cycle in human houses, there is a broad diversity of trophic levels and life histories represented. Apart from a few herbivorous arthropods associated with houseplants or those inadvertently living indoors (for example, brought in on cut plants), most taxa sampled from houses were either scavengers, predators, or parasitoids. Carpet beetles (Dermestidae) were found feeding on dog kibble, dead insects and nail clippings. Other scavengers, like silverfish (found in 68% of homes) and book lice were also common. Carrion-feeding flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) were found during the study emerging from a rodent killed by a house cat. Spiders (including spitting spiders, Scytodidae, that spit venom up to a centimeter to ensnare prey; Foelix, 2011) and centipedes (especially Scutigeridae) were the primary predators sampled. Minute parasitoid wasps (especially Eulophidae and Platygastridae s.l.) that potentially parasitize other household arthropods were also common inhabitants. For instance, one species of Eulophidae, Aprostocetus (Tetrastichodes) hagenowii (Ratzeburg) (Table S1), a known parasitoid of blattid cockroach egg cases (oothecae), was commonly collected in homes as were its hosts. Considering the range and abundance of life histories found in our study, the trophic dynamics of the indoor ecosystem is an area in need of future study. 
 
 The rich arthropod diversity we identified from houses reflects a gradient of association with human habitations, from synanthropic arthropods that appear strongly adapted to human houses (cobweb spiders, carpet beetles, book lice), to others that seek shelter and resources only on occasion (ants, ground beetles, hunting spiders, smoky brown cockroaches), to many groups that simply become trapped in houses to their own detriment (leafhoppers, gall midges, click beetles). Most of the arthropod groups we identified do not have life histories that are known to be closely associated with the indoors. Many arthropods may find themselves indoors as a result of the ‘Malaise trap effect’: houses, like Malaise and other flight intercept traps, are effective at capturing local arthropods that may be travelling through the environment or are attracted to houses by artificial light, food, and shelter. These arthropods may be active in a house for a short period of time, where interactions between them and the house’s residents may occur, but eventually they must either find an exit or succumb to mortality. The idea that homes are traps or filters of local, outdoor arthropod fauna implies the importance of further investigating the dynamics between the greater landscape and the indoor environment. 
 
 Biodiversity in urban landscapes is richer than was once thought (McKinney, 2008; Fattorini, 2011; Fattorini, 2014), and we find here that the indoor, manufactured environment also supports more diversity than anticipated. These findings represent a new understanding of the makeup of the indoor arthropod community and their distribution within houses. Arthropods within our homes are both diverse and prevalent, and are a mix of closely synanthropic species and a great diversity of species that wander indoors by accident. Many species we found were unexpected, unnoticed by residents until they were collected, and play no pestiferous role in human houses. Yet, further research on the ecological dynamics of the indoor biome is needed to understand the potential economic and health implications of the species that live and have evolved in such close proximity to us. ||||| Matt Bertone 
 
 If only they paid rent. There are on average 100 species of creepy-crawly in every house, according to the first comprehensive census of house-dwelling arthropods. 
 
 Some are part of an intricate ecosystem that relies on crumbs and nail clippings for food. Others are accidental visitors trapped in this strange and dangerous world, unbeknownst to most homeowners.

 The survey found 579 species, mainly insects, spiders, beetles, mites, flies and ants, in 50 detached houses in the leafy suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina. “The residents were really surprised and often horrified that we found so much, so we had to calm them down by saying it was normal,” says Matt Bertone of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who led the survey. 
 
 He says the results dispel ideas that modern homes are sterile deserts, showing instead that they teem with unseen life. “The biggest surprise was finding at least one species in almost every room, with only five of the 554 rooms drawing a blank,” says Bertone. Some have adapted to live in human homes permanently, such as cobweb spiders and booklice. 
 
 Bertone says that the species the team spotted most frequently are known to be abundant worldwide, but the exact proportions of creatures found in this suburb may differ from those in inner-city tower blocks or rural houses. 
 
 Home ecosystem 
 
 The arthropods were found anywhere from carpets and floorboard cracks to shelves and skirting boards. 
 
 The good news is that most are unlikely to harm you or your house. In fact, many pest species, such as bed bugs or German cockroaches, were absent from most of the houses. 
 
 The only creatures found in every home were ants, carpet beetles, cobweb spiders and gall midges. “They rely on things we produce or have in our homes,” says Bertone. 
 
 Taken together, these regulars form a neat ecosystem, with spiders and centipedes as apex predators, hunting smaller fry such as carpet beetles and other spiders. 
 
 The carpet beetles and book lice do much of the clearing up, scavenging dead insects, moulds and algae, as well as polishing off food crumbs and detritus from our own bodies, including nail clippings, hair and dead skin. Some carpet beetles live on and consume spiders’ webs. 
 
 Personal jungle 
 
 Other species, such as house flies, stray in temporarily, maybe for food or warmth in harsh weather. Still others come in by accident and are usually trapped and doomed once indoors. 
 
 “The indoor environment has proved to be full of unexpected biological diversity and houses are our own personal jungles,” says Anne Madden of the University of Colorado at Boulder. “We clearly have much to learn about the potential food webs in our homes.” 
 
 “Understanding the life that permeates our dwellings is essential to establishing the influence of our indoor life on our health,” says Jack Gilbert of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. “Insects have their own bacteria and move them round a house, so by understanding their biodiversity, we can better explain the distribution of microbes around our homes.” 
 
 Another recent survey of 1200 households across the United States found that household dust holds an average of 9000 different species of bacteria and fungi.

Some new research suggests you need to step that number up by a factor of 10. Or more. But don't panic: Insects and their relatives are living peacefully in your home. They aren't bothering you. Well, except psychologically, now that you know hundreds of them are there. 
 
 Entomologists have been saying for years it's not possible to have a completely bug-proof home; now there are numbers to back that up. Scientists carefully collected all the arthropods (insects, spiders, mites, and crustaceans, among others) they found in 50 homes in North Carolina. In every single home they examined, they found extra residents. Of 554 rooms in those homes, all but five (less than 1 percent) had some crunchy squatters. If you think your house is spotless and bug-free, you are wrong. When you move into an empty house, it’s not really empty. You have roommates. 
 
 Over 400 people volunteered to have entomologists search their homes for bugs after a public call for participation. Because really, how often do you get to have a group of PhDs crawl around your house on their hands and knees for free? 
 
 The research group chose a representative selection of homes, big and small, from 7 to almost 100 years old. They limited themselves to visible surfaces under and behind furniture, baseboards, ceilings, and shelves. I asked researcher Matt Bertone what it was like to knock on a someone's door, introduce yourself, and then spend hours crawling around their floor with a headlamp and tweezers. He said it wasn’t awkward until the end (well, more awkward than what you’d expect if a complete stranger looked under your couch and bed). 
 
 Before leaving, the collection team reviewed what they found with the homeowners. It was a bit of a shock for some. “I think they thought we would only find a few things, and we would come back with hundreds of specimens,” said Bertone. His team collected and identified more than 10,000 specimens during the course of the study. On average, more than 93 different species lived in each home. And that is an extremely conservative estimate. 
 
 Bertone et al 2016 
 
 All the houses examined contained flies, beetles, spiders, and ants. Almost all of the houses (98 percent) contained booklice, harmless tiny insects you’ve probably never heard of. Booklice eat mold and mildew, commonly found in starchy paste of books and wallpaper. 
 
 Don’t start pricing flamethrowers on Amazon just yet. “It's very benign,"" says Michelle Trautwein, co-author on the study. ""We all have these quiet roommates that really don't have a lot of negative impact on our lives.” Most of the arthropods found were described by the researchers as “air plankton""; they were accidental entrants into the home that got trapped and died there. 
 
 For example, the group found gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) in every home, even though their entire life cycle takes place outdoors. There is nothing for them to eat in a human home. Gall flies are also representative of many arthropods found in one other way: They are best seen with a microscope. A big gall fly is about 2 mm long.

 “So much of what we find in houses is incredibly tiny, and even if you're looking for it, you wouldn't be able to find it,” said Trautwein. Someone who isn’t a specialist might never see them unless they know what to look for. “I’d be crawling around and I'd see fecal specs and I go, 'Okay, there's a spider under there,'"" says Bertone. ""People don't know what those are. They see those little spots, but they have no idea that it's spider poop.” 
 
 Now that you are suspicious about every speck you might see in your house, here’s what the researchers didn’t find: not a single brown recluse spider or bed bug. They didn’t find very many fleas. Most of the arthropods they found were harmless, minute, accidental visitors lured in from the outdoors to a quiet death from starvation, dehydration, or cobweb spiders. 
 
 The number of bugs in our houses makes more sense when you consider that human-built spaces encompass an area as large as some natural biomes globally. But we know far more about the animals outside our houses than in them. “The finding that ‘non-pest’ species made up the majority, ... and the sheer number and prevalence of arthropod groups found highlights [our] current lack of knowledge,” says University of Liverpool biologist Crystal Frost. 
 
 Many of the insects identified in the study weren’t able to be identified to species—and some of them will probably turn out to be new species. Our homes aren't the Galapagos Islands, but they are unique environments that organisms may specialize in. We know that some fungi are found only in bathrooms and washing machines, and the same is quite likely of a few insects and spiders from this study. Carpet beetles, clothes moths, and cobweb spiders have limited abilities to disperse on their own, but we move them from place to place with our belongings. 
 
 This research is being continued across several continents, with hopes of finding patterns in our arthropod bunkmates. Their preliminary data is clear—you’ve got bugs in your house. All of you. 
 
 Keep Calm and Arthropod On 
 
 You probably weren’t freaking out about the hundreds (probably thousands) of tiny animals in your home before you read this, so why not strive to reclaim that Zen state of blissful ignorance? Even better, embrace the amazing diversity all around you. Wildlife doesn’t stop at your doorstep. It comes inside with you and lives on you. 
 
 Our homes are places of extreme environments and change. Showers go from dry to torrents of scalding water in an instant; sinks are deluged with minty alcoholic mouthwash, caustic cleaners, and hair from our grooming rituals. Humidity and temperature in ductwork change abruptly as air conditioning or heating kicks on. Anything that manages to live in this environment should get at least a little grudging admiration. 
 
 This research is just the latest in a series of papers beginning to investigate the urban environment around you. Most of the info is profoundly disturbing to people who want their homes to be immaculate. Microbial communities on our pillow cases and toilet seats are remarkably similar. Follicle mites are having sex in your facial pores right now. In the last 50 years, American basements were quietly taken over by a foreign species of camel cricket. No one noticed. It's exploration of a whole new frontier, a new environment in which we can all be participants in the science.

 Spiders, flies, beetles, ants, and book lice are among the critters detected in a new study, the first to evaluate arthropod diversity in U.S. homes. 
 
 Arthropods—a huge group that includes insects, spiders, and their relatives—have been living and evolving alongside people for millennia. (See ""Why Did Thousands of Venomous Spiders Swarm a House?"") 
 
 “Nobody had done a comprehensive inventory like this before, and we found far more diversity than most people would expect,"" says study leader Matt Bertone, an entomologist at North Carolina State University. 
 
 “That old wives’ tale that you’re never more than ten feet [three meters] away from a spider? If you’re in your home, that might be true,” Bertone says: His team found spiders in all of the homes surveyed. 
 
 Home is Where the Bugs Are 
 
 For the study, Bertone and colleagues visited 50 free-standing houses in and around Raleigh, North Carolina. 
 
 “We had two or three entomologists searching the houses, crawling on our hands and knees with flashlights and collecting anything we could find into vials,” says Bertone. The researchers collected their samples, both living and dead, using forceps, aspirators—a type of vacuum—and nets.

 Bertone and his colleagues gathered over 10,000 specimens, representing over 300 families of arthropods, and conservatively, 579 species. Each house was home to anywhere between 32 and 211 arthropod species, according to the study, published January 19 in the journal Peer J. 
 
 In addition to the sheer number of species, the researchers were surprised at how many bugs they found in the homes. Out of more than 550 rooms sampled, only five were totally bugless. (See ""7 Bug and Spider Myths Squashed."") 
 
 Although some of the species have adapted to live happily alongside humans, such as book lice, others, such as leafhoppers and gall midges, are accidental visitors. These bugs simply wander in from the outdoors and can become trapped and die, the study authors say. 
 
 Peaceful Cohabitators 
 
 There are probably even more bugs in our homes, since the researchers only collected arthropods from visible surfaces, excluding areas such as behind walls, under heavy furniture, and in drawers and cabinets, Bertone says. 
 
 But he emphasizes that we shouldn't be afraid of the bugs in our midst—the vast majority are not harmful. Typical household pests, such as German cockroaches, termites, and fleas, were only present in a few homes, the survey found. And those ubiquitous spiders found in every home are very benign—not to mention they eat pests. (Related: ""What Should You Do If You Find a Spider in Your House?"") 
 
 “My take-home message to the homeowners was that these things are living among you but they’re not dangerous and you won’t see them unless you really look for them,” says Bertone. “They are peacefully cohabitating with us.” 
 
 Jason Cryan, an entomologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, says he's ""not bothered by the fact that they are finding so much arthropod diversity in our homes."" 
 
 “In many cases this diversity goes unseen and unheard,” says Cryan, who was not involved in the study. 
 
 “I hope people will appreciate this natural diversity and realize that this life among us is not a health or a cleanliness concern.”","– You thought Asian camel crickets were bad. A new report in journal Peer J finds hundreds of bugs likely lurk in your home, including spiders, beetles, ants, and book lice. Scientists got down on their hands and knees and combed 50 houses in the suburbs of Raleigh, NC, picking up any bugs they found, to determine the diversity of arthropods indoors. They ""found far more diversity than most people would expect,"" study leader Matt Bertone tells National Geographic. More specifically, they gathered 10,000 bugs from 579 species. If that doesn't freak you out, this probably will: Each home housed 100 species on average, per New Scientist, though one revealed 211 species. And less than 1% of rooms were bug-free. ""That old wives' tale that you're never more than 10 feet away from a spider? If you're in your home, that might be true,"" Bertone says. Every home contained ants, carpet beetles, cobweb spiders, and gall midges, which ""rely on things we produce or have in our homes,"" says Bertone. About 98% held book lice, which eat mold and mildew, reports Wired. There were even some bugs scientists suspect might be new species.

181,"Obama spokesman: That Romney birth certificate joke is “gutterball politics” 
 
 posted at 4:17 pm on August 24, 2012 by Allahpundit 
 
 In case you’re wondering what it takes to offend a campaign whose allies have accused Romney of tax evasion based on anonymous “sources” and blamed him for leaving a steelworker’s wife to die from cancer uninsured, here you go. Turns out Obama, whose major contribution to deficit reduction this past year was the fiscal joke known as the “Buffett Rule,” is running a serious, substantive campaign while Romney, who just took up the sword of entitlement reform by picking Paul Ryan, is all about smears and distractions. The things you learn on MSNBC. 
 
 Two points. One: I don’t get why Romney would step on his own message to make a birth certificate joke. He’s spent the past week neck-deep in culture-war quicksand thanks to Todd Akin and is looking at another week of it once the Democratic convention opens. He could have used today to talk about unemployment or his energy policy or whatever, but instead he chose to throw the press some chum with this. (One of his aides told BuzzFeed that the line wasn’t in Romney’s prepared remarks but was delivered off-the-cuff. I’ll bet.) The point, I guess, is to prove that he’s capable of being politically incorrect by tweaking the media on a subject that makes them hyperventilate like almost nothing else, but anyone who cares much about that was voting for him already. It’s hard enough for Romney to break through the media’s wall of nonsense to reach voters. Why hand them another brick? 
 
 Two: This is the perfect ending to a week marked by criticism from Jake Tapper and, more tepidly, Chuck Todd that the media isn’t doing its job. From the moment this sentence escaped Romney’s lips, it was a metaphysical certainty that it would dominate political coverage for the rest of the day, with MSNBC’s pants-wetting expected to last well into the evening. No one expected otherwise even though everyone understands that few votes, if any, will shift because of this. When I started reading blogs years ago, it was relatively rare for reporters to admit that the media is biased or prone to trivial treatment of momentous events; whenever a reporter or editor actually ‘fessed up — the example that sticks in my mind was Daniel Okrent acknowledging the patently obvious fact that the NYT is a liberal newspaper — it was big news, a moral victory for conservatives who demanded that the press own up to its prejudices. These days, my sense is that they’re more willing to own up (they have to be since there are so many more critics online cataloging them) but that they’ve started to use their candor almost as an excuse to be as trivial as they want. Sure, they’ll spend three days navel-gazing about Romney’s dumb joke, but as long as Todd or Bob Schieffer or some other big name TV journalist sighs afterward and admits that it’s silly to spend three days on this, well, then that’s proof that they have “integrity” after all. Three cheers for progress. 
 
 Two clips for you here, one of Obama’s flack checking the various talking-point boxes and the other, via the Examiner, of MSNBC being very MSNBC-ish.

 (CBS News) In an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Scott Pelley on Friday, Mitt Romney played down the remarks he made about President Obama's origins, arguing that they amounted to a joke and not a ""swipe"" at the president. 
 
 ""No, no, not a swipe,"" Romney said. ""I've said throughout the campaign and before, there's no question about where he was born. He was born in the U.S. This was fun about us, and coming home. And humor, you know -- we've got to have a little humor in a campaign."" 
 
 Romney was on the campaign trail in his home state of Michigan Friday when he made a crack at the ""birther"" suspicions that ultimately drove Mr. Obama to release his long-form birth certificate to prove he was born in the United States. 
 
 ""I love being home in this place where Ann and I were raised, where both of us were born. Ann was born in Henry Ford Hospital. I was born in Harper Hospital,"" Romney said in Commerce, Michigan earlier Friday. ""No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised."" 
 
 Romney told Pelley that taking the stage in Michigan Friday was an emotional moment for him and his wife Ann. 
 
 ""You just felt, you know, you felt sort of everything that happened to us here - how we grew up, how we met here, the sacrifices that our families made - coming to Michigan, you know, it all sort of just washed over me as we got up on that stage,"" he said. ""It was a very emotional feeling. It's a feeling of coming home."" 
 
 While Romney's remarks may have amounted to an off-the-cuff joke, they elicited a swift and harsh response from the Obama campaign. 
 
 ""Throughout this campaign, Governor Romney has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them,"" Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt emailed reporters. ""It's one thing to give the stage in Tampa to Donald Trump, [Arizona] Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio, and [Kansas Secretary of State] Kris Kobach. But Governor Romney's decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement should give pause to any rational voter across America."" 
 
 The Obama campaign also capitalized on the incident with a fundraising pitch to supporters. In an email with the subject line, ""A new low for Mitt Romney,"" campaign manager Jim Messina asked supporters to ""take a moment or two to think about [Romney's remark], what he's actually saying, and what it says about Mitt Romney. Then make a donation of $5 or more to re-elect Barack Obama today."" 
 
 The joke, in fact, was a departure from the way Romney has typically handled the ""birther"" issue. 
 
 ""I think the citizenship test has been passed. I believe the president was born in the United States. There are real reasons to get this guy out of office,"" Romney said in April 2011. Romney this year defended his alliance with Donald Trump, an outspoken ""birther,"" but Romney made clear he disagreed with Trump on the issue. 
 
 When Pelley asked Romney if he agrees Mr. Obama is the ""legitimate president of the United States,"" Romney responded, ""I've said that probably 30 times by now, and 31 certainly won't hurt."" 
 
 More from Pelley's interview with Romney will air Friday and Monday, August 27 on the CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley. Additional excerpts will air during CBS News' primetime coverage of the Republican National Convention, Tuesday, August 28 through Thursday, August 30, beginning at 10 p.m. ET each night. ||||| COMMERCE, Mich. — In a speech to thousands of supporters at a family orchard outside Detroit Friday afternoon, Mitt Romney tried a joke as he touted his family roots in the state — and got himself in trouble in the process. 
 
 After he and Mrs. Romney both took turns talking about how excited they were to be “home” in Michigan, Romney said, ““Nobody ever has to see my birth certificate. They know this is the place where I was born and raised.” 
 
 The line, which prompted laughter and then cheers from the roughly 5,000 people gathered here, was an apparent reference to the long-debunked conspiracy theory that President Obama was born in Africa, and therefore not Constitutionally qualified to be president. 
 
 But the Romney campaign quickly pushed back against questions about whether Romney was invoking “birtherism.” 
 
 “The governor has always said, and has repeatedly said, he believes the president was born here in the United States,” said adviser Kevin Madden. “He was only referencing that Michigan, where he is campaigning today, is the state where he himself was born and raised.” 
 
 A campaign aide told BuzzFeed, on condition of anonymity, that Romney did not plan the birth certificate joke in advance, and that it was an “off-the-cuff reference to him being a homegrown guy of Michigan” that was wrongly interpreted by the press. 
 
 Still, a spokesman for the Obama campaign seized on the opportunity to decry Romney for extremism. 
 
 “Throughout this campaign, Governor Romney has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them,” said spokesman Ben LaBolt. “It’s one thing to give the stage in Tampa to Donald Trump, Sheriff Arpaio, and Kris Kobach. But Governor Romney’s decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement should give pause to any rational voter across America.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the reaction from the crowd of Republicans here was largely enthusiastic, with some laughing it off as a politically incorrect joke, and others treating it as a welcome attack on what they believe to be the coverup of the president’s birthplace. 
 
 Asked what he made of Romney’s line, Jim Barzakov, a retiree from Berryville, MI, expressed frustration with reporters’ fixation on the issue. 
 
 “What is it with this birth certificate? It’s every question I get from you guys!” he said. “You must be all liberals! What kind of a question is that?” 
 
 He then said the meaning of the line was simple: “It says Romney has his birth certificate; Obama can’t find his.” Asked about the certificate the White House released last year, Barzakov dismissed it as a “photoshop certificate.” 
 
 Therese Cayline, who works at a real estate management company in Waterford, MI, said she doesn’t consider herself a “birther” — but raised several of the talking points espoused by skeptics of the president’s birth certificate. 
 
 “[Romney] was born and raised in Michigan and as far as Obama goes, his grandma was there at his birth and his grandma has never been outside Kenya,” Cayline said. “So I find it ironic that he won’t show the real birth certificate.” 
 
 But Laura Barnett, 22, from Wesfield, MI, said the birth certificate line was just a joke, not to be taken too seriously. 
 
 “I think people, if they want to make it controversial, they can,” Barnett said. “But I think Romney was just being a little funny. I know the racism is serious and it’s very controversial like I said but I think there’s always room for some humor.”","– Mitt Romney's joke at a rally today that ""no one's ever asked to see my birth certificate"" is living on.

This represents a significant increase from the previous reward offer of $10 million announced in October 2011. 
 
 Protecting the homeland and the American people is our top counterterrorism priority, and just as we have intensified our efforts against ISIL, we are increasing the means available to us to gain information on their leadership and bring them to justice. In June 2014, ISIL, also known as Da’esh, seized control of portions of Syria and Iraq, self-declared a so-called Islamic caliphate, and named al-Baghdadi as caliph. In recent years, ISIL has gained the allegiance of jihadist groups and radicalized individuals around the world, and has inspired attacks in the United States. 
 
 Under al-Baghdadi, ISIL has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the Middle East, including the brutal murder of numerous civilian hostages from Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The group also has conducted chemical weapons attacks in Iraq and Syria in defiance of the longstanding global norm against the use of these appalling weapons, and has enabled or directed terrorist attacks beyond the borders of its self-declared caliphate. 
 
 In 2011, the Department of State designated Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224. Al-Baghdadi was also added to the United Nations Security Council ISIL (Da’esh) and al-Qaida Sanctions Committee in 2011. Al-Baghdadi was the leader of al-Qa’ida in Iraq (AQI), which subsequently morphed into ISIL.

 Vladimir Putin on Tuesday meets with Germany's chancellor for the first time in two years. Their relationship was strained after Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Putin then speaks to President Trump. 
 
 DAVID GREENE, HOST: 
 
 No Western leader knows Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, better than German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And their relationship has been difficult. You think about Ukraine. You think about the sanctions on Russia. You think about the conflict in Syria. Well, today, Putin will greet Merkel in the resort town of Sochi. That's a resort town he loves. It is where the 2014 Winter Olympics were held. And this is Merkel's first visit to Russia in two years. NPR's Lucian Kim is in Moscow and joins us. Good morning, Lucian. 
 
 LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning, David. 
 
 GREENE: So why this Putin-Merkel meeting and why now? 
 
 KIM: Well, I think you could actually ask why has it taken so long? Yeah, Merkel has really reduced her contacts with Putin to a minimum. She's really been focused on finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine which has largely disappeared from the headlines. Her official reason for coming now to Russia is to prepare for the G20, the Group of 20 major economies summit in Germany in July. But, of course, the timing is really important. 
 
 The European Union today is looking probably more vulnerable than it has ever. And Putin is looking like the most stable leader in the region. So I think it's kind of a recognition that you need to talk to Russia if you want to solve any problems. 
 
 GREENE: That is amazing to have arrived at that point where European countries feel like Putin is the most stable potential ally. So that's really what Merkel's trying to get from Putin, some sort of promise that he's going to work with Europe in a progressive way, in a productive way? 
 
 KIM: Well, maybe not as an ally, but, I mean, he's not going away. He's been, you know, in power since 2000. The only other leader is Merkel that's been around that long. But I think it's - it's, as I said, it was more - it's more of a recognition that you're going to have to deal with him if you're going to reach a resolution in Ukraine or in Syria. He has become the indispensable leader. And I think that's why Merkel is also - is going and is ready to talk to him. 
 
 GREENE: How do Russians view this meeting? Do they want Putin to get closer to leaders like Merkel in the West? 
 
 KIM: Well, I think for Russians it's very important or for Putin it's very important to be seen as someone who is a major player. So by speaking to Merkel, that obviously helps him. And he's really been on a roll. He just spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Abe last week. And tomorrow, he's going to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Sochi, as well. So I think this - the international buzz around him definitely helps him because it shows that Russia is a player that the rest of the world cannot ignore. 
 
 GREENE: Well, and speaking of that, I mean, he has - Putin also has a phone call with President Donald Trump later today. How does that all fit into his diplomacy? 
 
 KIM: Well, that's really key. I mean, what's interesting is that it's coming after the Merkel phone call. And, you know... 
 
 GREENE: The meeting, yeah. 
 
 KIM: ...A lot of the - exactly. And a lot of the same issues are - affect the U.S.-Russian relations. That's Ukraine, Syria, terrorism. And under Obama, Merkel handled a lot of the European relations. So it's going to be interesting if Trump will also farm out, you know, dealing with Putin to Merkel. 
 
 GREENE: OK, speaking to NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow about some diplomacy that Vladimir Putin is taking part in today, including a phone call with Donald Trump. Lucian, thanks so much. 
 
 KIM: Thank you.

 MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump will speak by phone on Tuesday, RIA news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. 
 
 Trump will speak with Putin on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. EDT, the White House said on Monday night. 
 
 A senior Trump administration official said the two leaders would likely discuss the civil war in Syria, where Moscow backs the government of Bashar al-Assad and the United States supports rebels trying to overthrow him. ||||| U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spoken together by telephone for the third time since Trump took office in January. 
 
 The scheduled phone conversation on May 2 was the first between the two leaders since the United States carried out a missile strike against a Syrian air base in retaliation for what Western countries charged was a chemical-weapons attack against civilians by Syrian government forces. 
 
 A White House statement described the conversation as ""a very good one"" -- including discussions on the war in Syria, ""working together to eradicate terrorism throughout the Middle East,"" and ""how best to resolve the very dangerous situation in North Korea."" 
 
 The White House also announced that Washington will send a representative to Syria peace talks scheduled in Astana, Kazakhstan, on May 3 and 4. 
 
 A Kremlin statement said the emphasis of their phone conversation was on coordinating Russian and U.S. actions in the fight against terrorism. 
 
 It said the two agreed to increase dialogue between U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in an attempt to bring a resolution to the war in Syria. 
 
 Moscow also said Trump and Putin both expressed support for the idea of organizing their first face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the July 7-8 summit of the Group of 20 (G20) in Hamburg, Germany. 
 
 On North Korea, the Kremlin said Putin called upon Trump to show restraint and make an effort to reduce tensions that have been raised in the aftermath of North Korea's nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile tests. 
 
 Several hours before their phone conversation, Putin met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Russian Black Sea port of Sochi for talks focusing on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, as well as on strained bilateral relations. 
 
 Both leaders said after their May 2 meeting that it is essential for all parties to fulfill their commitments under the Minsk process to regulate the conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists. 
 
 ""Today we once again reiterated the necessity of the strict observation of the Minsk agreements by the parties to the conflict [in eastern Ukraine],"" Putin told journalists. 
 
 Merkel said Moscow and Berlin ""are of differing opinions about the cause of the conflict."" She said it was essential for Kyiv to regain complete control of its border, including the portion between the separatist-controlled areas and Russia. 
 
 Putin and Merkel also discussed the six-year-old civil war in Syria. Putin repeated Russia's calls for an ""impartial investigation"" into the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria's Idlib Province last month that left about 80 people dead. 
 
 Putin also said Russia was counting on the United States to help find ""efficient solutions"" to the conflict in Syria. 
 
 Merkel said she spoke to Putin about domestic developments in Russia, including the arrests of demonstrators at recent anticorruption rallies and media reports about the persecution of homosexual men in the Russian North Caucasus region of Chechnya. 
 
 ""The possibility of the right to demonstrate is a part of civil society,"" Merkel said. 
 
 She also urged Putin to ""use his influence"" to put an end to the abuse of homosexuals in Chechnya. 
 
 Russia's Novaya Gazeta reported in April that at least 100 gay men had been abducted by security forces in Chechnya and at least three had been killed. 
 
 Putin defended the actions of Russian police, saying they acted within the framework of the law and showed ""far more restraint than their colleagues in other European countries."" 
 
 Putin also categorically rejected allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. presidential election in November or was playing any role in Germany's domestic politics. 
 
 The Russia leader said it was ""unthinkable"" that Russia would interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries. He dismissed the reports of interference in the U.S. election as ""rumors."" Putin added that Moscow would not tolerate outside interference in its own domestic affairs. 
 
 In January, the U.S. intelligence community issued an assessment charging that Putin ""ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election."" Security agencies in Germany, France, and other countries have also alleged Russian efforts to influence their electoral processes. 
 
 For her part, Merkel said she was confident Germany could handle any disinformation campaigns and would take ""decisive measures"" in the event of interference. She also noted that ""hybrid warfare plays a role in Russia's military doctrine."" 
 
 The two leaders also discussed preparations for the G20) summit in Hamburg on July 7-8. The G20 is now the chief format for Russia to meet the other world powers after its exclusion from the Group of Eight (G8), which is now the G7. 
 
 In addition to his talks with Merkel, Putin is scheduled to talk by telephone with U.S. President Donald Trump later on May 2. 
 
 Merkel's one-day trip was her second visit to Russia since Moscow seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014. 
 
 Russia and Germany have scaled back ties and Merkel has strongly backed EU sanctions on Moscow for seizing Crimea and for its involvement in the war that has killed more than 9,900 people in eastern Ukraine since 2014. 
 
 A key mediator in the conflict, which pits Russia-backed separatists against Ukrainian government forces, Merkel is a major proponent of keeping the sanctions on Moscow in place until a stalled peace plan is fulfilled. 
 
 Merkel has attended several meetings with Putin, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and France's Francois Hollande aimed at implementing the Minsk II agreement, which she and Hollande brokered in February 2015. 
 
 The most recent such meeting was held in October and the four leaders spoke by phone in April, agreeing to step up implementation of the peace deal.

184,"You may have heard of “Movember”, a moustache growing charity event held during November each year that raises funds and awareness for prostate cancer and other men’s health issues, such as depression. The event was conceived in 1999 by a group of Australian men from Adelaide. 
 
 While the event is a great way for men and people who can grow moustaches to get involved in raising money for an important cause, it has heretofore been lacking in opportunities for women who have trouble growing moustaches to get involved (or at least opportunities that didn’t involve sleeping with moustached men for the cause) 
 
 Thus, inspired by an article on the popularity of the unibrow in Tajikistan sent in by reader Jess (thanks, Jess!), I hereby declare that the current month shall heretofore be known as….DECEMBROW. 
 
 Decembrow is, of course, all about the brow. Specifically, the unibrow.

 Challenging cultural norms about women’s facial hair while raising money for a good cause? Now that’s just the kind of thing that gets me in the holiday spirit. ||||| This holiday season, Feministing.com, an “online community for feminists,” is encouraging women to opt out of eyebrow waxing appointments in favor of looking like “Frida,” the girlfriend of Marxist Diego Rivera. 
 
 In response to “Movember,” a charity effort to raise awareness and money for prostate and testicular cancer during the month of November by having men grow moustaches, Feministing.com is calling for women to grow unibrows during December, which they are trying to dub “Decembrow.” 
 
 “While women in the U.S. generally rock two groomed brows, I say let’s be inspired by Movember and take this opportunity to let our facial hair grow…for a cause,” the Feministing.com website says. 
 
 While Movember is specifically targeted toward raising awareness and funds for prostate and testicular cancer, Feministing.org is simply telling women to participate in Decembrow for the cause “cause of your choice.” 
 
 For those who don’t already have unibrows, Feministing.com suggests acquiring a real one using herbal remedies or merely faking one with an eyebrow pencil. 
 
 While supportive of the charity aspect of the project, Penny Nance, the CEO of Concerned Women for America, was unsure of how and why “Decembrow” will help further the feminist movement. 
 
 “While I applaud the effort to raise awareness and funds to stop prostate cancer, I find it curious that feminists would choose to embrace facial hair and mostly wonder how that is different than any other month of the year,” Nance wrote in an e-mail to The Daily Caller. 
 
 Erica Jong, an American columnist and author, expressed a mix of support and confusion with regards to the “Decembrow” movement. 
 
 “As a blonde whose eyebrows disappear into her face I can’t do the unibrow thing, but I applaud anything that galvanizes women to show the power we have and often fail to use,” Jong wrote in an e-mail to TheDC. 
 
 But Jong wasn’t sure that emphasizing a woman’s appearance is all that empowering. 
 
 “I wish we could use our power to support womens’ and childrens’ welfare rather than focusing on appearance – -but whatthehey. Let’s do it to garner attention and show that we’re still here and still want true equality rather than scraps…Whatever challenges the antifeminist divide-and-conquer strategy of the wingnuts delights and inspires me,” Jong wrote to TheDC.

The idea: Women grow unibrows (or fake the look using an eyebrow pencil) to raise awareness for the cause of their choice, the Daily Caller reports. The CEO of Concerned Women for America notes that it's ""curious that feminists would choose to embrace facial hair"" and says she wonders ""how that is different than any other month of the year.""

 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Medicines (NSAIDs) (Also Called 'NSAID', 'Motrin', 'Ibuprofen', 'Naproxen') 
 
 What do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do? 
 
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively reduce inflammation (swelling) and relieve pain. Inflammation is the body's way of protecting itself after irritation or an injury. Signs of inflammation include redness, warmth, swelling, and pain. 
 
 NSAIDs are used to treat a variety of symptoms such as pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis and tendonitis. NSAIDs are also used to treat several other conditions, such as: 
 
 Osteoarthritis 
 
 Muscle aches 
 
 Backaches 
 
 Dental pain 
 
 Pain caused by gout 
 
 Bursitis, and 
 
 Menstrual cramps 
 
 They may also be used to reduce fever or relieve minor aches caused by the common cold. 
 
 How do NSAIDs work? 
 
 NSAIDs work by blocking the production of certain body chemicals that cause inflammation. NSAIDs are effective in treating pain caused by slow, prolonged tissue damage, such as the pain from an arthritic joint. NSAIDs are also effective in treating general or localized pain, such as back pain, menstrual cramps, and headaches. 
 
 NSAIDs work like corticosteroids (also called steroids), without many of the side effects of steroids. Steroids are man-made drugs that are very similar to cortisone, a naturally-occurring hormone. Like cortisone, NSAIDs are effective in reducing pain and inflammation often associated with joint and muscle diseases and injuries. 
 
 Are NSAIDs available without a prescription? 
 
 Yes. Over-the-counter NSAIDs are available without a prescription, in much lower doses than prescription NSAIDs. Current over-the-counter NSAIDs include: 
 
 Aspirin compounds (such as Anacin ® , Ascriptin ® , Bayer ® , Bufferin ® and Excedrin ® ) 
 
 , Ascriptin , Bayer , Bufferin and Excedrin ) Ibuprofen (such as Motrin ® and Advil ® ) 
 
 and Advil ) Naproxen sodium (such as Aleve®) 
 
 Over-the-counter NSAIDs are effective in treating mild osteoarthritis and some muscle injuries. Ibuprofen and naproxen are also used to treat fever. As with any medication, always follow the directions on the label and the instructions from your healthcare provider. 
 
 How long should I use an over-the-counter NSAID? 
 
 Never use an over-the-counter NSAID continuously for more than three days for fever, and 10 days for pain, without talking to your healthcare provider. Over-the-counter NSAIDs are effective pain-relievers, but they are intended for short-term use. When taking NSAIDs for long periods of time, you should be carefully monitored by your healthcare provider so he or she can watch for harmful side effects and change your treatment, if necessary. 
 
 How long do NSAIDs take to work? 
 
 Depending on the NSAID and the condition being treated, some NSAIDs may work within a few hours, while others may take a week or two before most benefits are achieved. Generally, for acute muscle injuries, we recommend NSAIDs that work quickly; however, these may need to be taken as often as every four to six hours because of their short action time. 
 
 For osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis that need long-term treatment, we usually recommend NSAIDs that need to be taken only once or twice a day. However, it generally takes longer for these drugs to have a therapeutic (healing) effect. 
 
 When are NSAIDs prescribed? 
 
 NSAIDs are often prescribed for rheumatologic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and moderate-to- severe osteoarthritis. NSAIDs are also prescribed for moderately painful musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain. 
 
 How are NSAIDs prescribed? 
 
 NSAIDs are prescribed in different doses, depending on the condition that is being treated. These drugs may need to be taken from one to four times a day. Do NOT increase the dose without asking your health care provider first. 
 
 Your healthcare provider may prescribe higher doses of NSAIDs if you have rheumatoid arthritis, for example, because this disease often causes a significant degree of heat, swelling, and redness and stiffness in the joints. Lower doses may be prescribed for osteoarthritis and acute muscle injuries, since there is generally less swelling and frequently no warmth or redness in the joints. 
 
 No single NSAID is guaranteed to work. Your healthcare provider may prescribe several types of NSAIDs in order to find the one that works best for you. Avoid aspirin and alcoholic beverages while taking NSAIDs. 
 
 What are some prescription NSAIDs? 
 
 Below is a list of some prescription NSAIDS. Please note: this is NOT an all-inclusive list. In addition, many NSAIDs are only available as generic formulations.

 How will my healthcare provider choose an NSAID that is right for me? 
 
 In planning your treatment, your healthcare provider will take into account the effectiveness and the risks of drugs. Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an appropriate treatment program. The drugs that will be prescribed will match the seriousness of your condition. Your healthcare provider will consider the results of your medical history, physical exam, X-rays, blood tests, and the presence of other medical conditions in creating your treatment plan. 
 
 It is important to meet with your healthcare provider regularly so he or she can watch for any harmful side effects and change your treatment, if necessary. Your healthcare provider may order blood tests or other tests (including a kidney function test) from time to time to determine how effective your treatment is, and to look for any harmful side effects. 
 
 Are there specific warnings associated with NSAID use? 
 
 The Food and Drug Administration added new warnings about NSAIDs in July 2015. 
 
 NSAIDs can increase the chance of heart attack or stroke. This risk may be greater if you have heart disease or risk factors (for example, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes) for heart disease. However, the risk may also be increased in people who do not have heart disease or those risk factors. 
 
 Heart problems caused by NSAIDs can happen within the first weeks of use, and may happen more frequently with higher doses or with long-term use. 
 
 NSAIDs should not be used right before or after heart bypass surgery. 
 
 NSAIDs may increase the chance of serious stomach and bowel side effects like ulcers and bleeding. This risk may be greater in older individuals. These side effects can occur without warning signs. 
 
 What are some common side effects of NSAIDs? 
 
 Side effects may occur if you are taking large doses of NSAIDs, or if you are taking them for a long time. Some side effects are mild and go away, while others are more serious and need medical attention. 
 
 Please note: The side effects listed below are the most common. All possible side effects are not included. Always contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about your particular medication. 
 
 The most frequently reported side effects of NSAIDs are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as: 
 
 Gas 
 
 Feeling bloated 
 
 Heartburn 
 
 Stomach pain 
 
 Nausea 
 
 Vomiting 
 
 Diarrhea and/or constipation 
 
 These side effects can generally be relieved by taking the drug with adequate amounts of food. NSAIDs may also be taken with milk or antacids (such as Maalox® or Mylanta®) to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms. 
 
 If the symptoms continue, the NSAID may need to be stopped. You should contact your healthcare provider if the symptoms listed above do not stop after a few days of taking the NSAID with food, milk, or antacids. 
 
 Some other side effects of NSAIDs include: 
 
 Dizziness 
 
 Feeling lightheaded 
 
 Problems with balance 
 
 Difficulty concentrating 
 
 Mild headaches 
 
 If these symptoms continue for more than a few days, stop taking the NSAID and contact your healthcare provider for more instructions. 
 
 What side effects should I tell my healthcare provider about right away? 
 
 If you have any of the following side effects, it is important to call your healthcare provider right away. 
 
 Fluid retention (recognized by swelling of the mouth, face, lips or tongue, around the ankles, feet, lower legs, hands, and possibly around the eyes) 
 
 Ringing in the ears 
 
 Severe rash or hives or red, peeling skin 
 
 Itching 
 
 Unexplained bruising and bleeding 
 
 Unusual weight gain 
 
 Black stools – bloody or black, tarry stools 
 
 Bloody or cloudy urine 
 
 Severe stomach pain 
 
 Blood or material that looks like coffee grounds in vomit (bleeding may occur without warning symptoms like pain) 
 
 Blurred vision 
 
 Wheezing, trouble breathing, or unusual cough 
 
 Chest pain, rapid heartbeat, palpitations 
 
 Acute fatigue, flu-like symptoms 
 
 Jaundice 
 
 Photosensitivity (greater sensitivity to light) 
 
 Change in strength on one side is greater than the other, trouble speaking or thinking, change in balance 
 
 Inability to pass urine, or change in how much urine is passed 
 
 Very bad back pain 
 
 Very bad headache 
 
 Feeling very tired and weak 
 
 Can I take NSAIDs if I'm being treated for high blood pressure? 
 
 NSAIDs can raise blood pressure in some people. Some people with high blood pressure (hypertension) may have to stop taking NSAIDs, if they notice that their blood pressure increases even if they are taking their blood pressure medications and following their diet. If you are taking blood pressure medication, talk to your healthcare provider before taking NSAIDs. 
 
 Is there anyone who should not take NSAIDs? 
 
 People who have the following conditions or circumstances should not use any type of NSAID until they are first evaluated by their healthcare provider: 
 
 Children and teenagers with viral infections (with or without fever) should not receive aspirin or aspirin-containing products due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. 
 
 Those who have an upcoming surgical procedure, including dental surgery 
 
 Diabetes that is difficult to control 
 
 Known kidney disease 
 
 Known liver disease 
 
 Known allergies to medications, especially aspirin, other NSAIDs, and sulfa drugs 
 
 Nasal polyps (linked to a greater chance of NSAID allergy) 
 
 Active peptic ulcer disease (stomach ulcers or previous history of stomach ulcer bleeding) 
 
 Gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD 
 
 Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis 
 
 Bleeding problems (people who have a history of prolonged bleeding time or who bruise easily) 
 
 People who have three or more alcoholic beverages per day 
 
 High blood pressure that is difficult to control 
 
 Active congestive heart failure 
 
 Asthma that gets worse when taking aspirin 
 
 Pregnancy in the third trimester 
 
 History of stroke or heart attack 
 
 If you are 65 years of age or older 
 
 Simultaneous use with certain medications such as warfarin (Coumadin ® ), clopidogrel (Plavix), corticosteroids (for example, prednisone), phenytoin (Dilantin ® ), cyclosporine (Neoral ® , Sandimmune ® ), probenecid, lithium (Lithobid ® ) and drugs used for various disease states such as arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and vitamins and other dietary/herbal supplements 
 
 ), clopidogrel (Plavix), corticosteroids (for example, prednisone), phenytoin (Dilantin ), cyclosporine (Neoral , Sandimmune ), probenecid, lithium (Lithobid ) and drugs used for various disease states such as arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and vitamins and other dietary/herbal supplements Phenylketonuria (PKU). Some nonprescription NSAIDs are sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. 
 
 Before you start taking over-the-counter NSAIDs, have your physician or pharmacist evaluate all of your current medications to see if there would be any potential interactions. 
 
 Can NSAIDs cause allergic reactions? 
 
 Very rarely, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can cause a generalized allergic reaction known as anaphylactic shock. If this happens, it usually occurs soon after the person starts taking the NSAID. The symptoms of this reaction include: 
 
 Swollen eyes, lips, or tongue 
 
 Difficulty swallowing 
 
 Shortness of breath 
 
 Rapid heart rate 
 
 Chest pain 
 
 Decrease in sedation 
 
 If any of these symptoms occur, call 9-1-1 or have someone drive you to the nearest emergency room immediately. 
 
 Before medication is prescribed, tell your healthcare provider: 
 
 If you are allergic to any medications, foods, or other substances 
 
 If you are currently taking any other medications (including over-the-counter medications) and/or herbal or dietary supplements 
 
 If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding 
 
 If you have problems taking any medications 
 
 If you have anemia, kidney or liver disease, stomach or peptic ulcers, heart disease, high blood pressure, bleeding or clotting problems, asthma, or growth in the nose (nasal polyps) 
 
 Before you start taking any new medication, ask your healthcare provider: 
 
 What is the name of the medication? 
 
 Why do I need to take it? 
 
 How often should I take it? 
 
 What time of day should I take it? 
 
 Should I take it on an empty stomach or with meals? 
 
 Where should I store the medication? 
 
 What should I do if I forget to take a dose? 
 
 How long should I expect to take the medication? 
 
 How will I know it is working? 
 
 What side effects should I expect? 
 
 Will the medication interfere with driving, working, or other activities? 
 
 Does the medication interact with any foods, alcohol, or other medications (including over-the-counter medications, herbal and/or dietary supplements)?

 RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – For the last several years, the FDA has warned that ibuprofen, Naproxen and other NSAID-type painkillers may cause an increased risk for heart disease and stroke. 
 
 Now the FDA has strengthened its warning for these drugs and says that these agents absolutely do raise the risk for heart attack and stroke. 
 
 The FDA said it reviewed a large number of studies that supported the conclusion that the medicines caused increased risk. The studies estimated that the relative risk increased by 10 percent to 50 percent, depending on the drugs and the doses considered. 
 
 The new FDA warning covers drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDS for short. They include ibuprofen, sold under brand names like Advil or Motrin; naproxen (Aleve), as well as prescription arthritis drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex. 
 
 Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs work by inhibiting production of prostaglandins—(by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase). Prostaglandins are chemicals released by injured cells that trigger inflammation and pain. It is important to remember that Tylenol, known generically as acetaminophen, is not an NSAID and works in a different way. It is not included in this new FDA warning. Tylenol also has potential health risks and this includes liver damage and toxicity when taken in very high doses. 
 
 Prescription NSAIDs are an important treatment for the symptoms of many debilitating conditions, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis‎, gout and other rheumatological conditions. 
 
 NSAIDs are used to temporarily reduce fever and to treat minor aches and pains such as headaches, toothaches, backaches, muscular aches, tendonitis, strains, sprains and menstrual cramps. 
 
 Remember that in addition, some combination medicines that relieve various symptoms, such as multi-symptom cold products, contain NSAIDs. 
 
 According to an FDA spokesman, the “FDA is strengthening an existing warning in prescription drug labels and over-the-counter (OTC) drug facts labels to indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke, either of which can lead to death.” 
 
 The FDA has carefully reviewed the data for the last year and has found that in numerous studies it has been clear that the use of NSAIDS is associated with an increased risk for heart disease and stroke. 
 
 Some of the studies they looked at showed a clear pattern: people who took NSAIDS were more likely to have heart attacks or strokes. Many of the researchers found that the time course of the development of heart disease can be both early and late in the course of starting NSAIDS. 
 
 The FDA added a boxed warning to prescription drug labels for the increased risk for heart disease and stroke in 2005. More recent data has now prompted the FDA to update NSAID labeling. 
 
 Today we know that the risk of heart attack and stroke may occur early in treatment, even in the first weeks. People who have cardiovascular disease, particularly those who recently had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery, are at the greatest risk for cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs. This particular population is at very high risk—they are quite vulnerable and should avoid NSAIDs when possible. 
 
 The bottom line is that NSAIDs are effective treatments for pain, inflammation and fever. 
 
 Consumers can still take them but should be aware of this increased risk of heart attack or stroke, especially at higher doses. 
 
 If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor before using an NSAID. 
 
 Together, with your doctor, you must balance the benefits of NSAIDs with the possible risks. 
 
 Seek urgent medical attention and stop taking NSAIDs if you experience symptoms that might signal heart problems or stroke — chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden weakness in one part or side of the body, or sudden slurred speech. If you take these drugs, take the smallest effective dose.

 Next time you reach into the medicine cabinet seeking relief for a headache, backache or arthritis, be aware of important safety information for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
 
 FDA is strengthening an existing warning in prescription drug labels and over-the-counter (OTC) Drug Facts labels to indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke, either of which can lead to death. Those serious side effects can occur as early as the first few weeks of using an NSAID, and the risk might rise the longer people take NSAIDs. (Although aspirin is also an NSAID, this revised warning doesn’t apply to aspirin.) 
 
 The OTC drugs in this group are used for the temporary relief of pain and fever. The prescription drugs in this group are used to treat several kinds of arthritis and other painful conditions. Because many prescription and OTC medicines contain NSAIDs, consumers should avoid taking multiple remedies with the same active ingredient. 
 
 The Risks and What’s New 
 
 Prescription NSAIDs are an important treatment for the symptoms of many debilitating conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis‎, gout and other rheumatological and painful conditions. OTC NSAIDs are used to temporarily reduce fever and to treat minor aches and pains such as headaches, toothaches, backaches, muscular aches, tendonitis, strains, sprains and menstrual cramps. Common OTC NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). In addition, some combination medicines that relieve various symptoms, such as multi-symptom cold products, contain NSAIDs. 
 
 “Be careful not to take more than one product that contains an NSAID at a time,” says Karen M. Mahoney, M.D., deputy director of FDA’s Division of Nonprescription Drug Products. How will you know? Check the list of active ingredients in the Drug Facts label. 
 
 The labels for both prescription NSAIDs and OTC NSAIDs already have information on heart attack and stroke risk. In the coming months, FDA will require manufacturers of prescription NSAIDs to update their labels with more specific information about heart attack and stroke risks. FDA will also request that the manufacturers of OTC NSAIDs update the heart attack and stroke risk information in Drug Facts labels. 
 
 FDA added a boxed warning to prescription drug labels for this risk in 2005. More recent data and information are prompting FDA to update NSAID labeling. Today we know that the risk of heart attack and stroke may occur early in treatment, even in the first weeks. 
 
 “There is no period of use shown to be without risk,” says Judy Racoosin, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of FDA’s Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products. 
 
 People who have cardiovascular disease, particularly those who recently had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery, are at the greatest risk for cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs. 
 
 FDA is adding information in the drug label for people who already have had a heart attack. This vulnerable population is at an increased risk of having another heart attack or dying of heart attack-related causes if they’re treated with NSAIDs, according to studies. 
 
 But the risk is also present in people without cardiovascular disease. “Everyone may be at risk – even people without an underlying risk for cardiovascular disease,” Racoosin adds. 
 
 What Consumers Should Do 
 
 NSAIDs are effective treatments for pain, inflammation and fever. Consumers can still take them but should be aware of this increased risk of heart attack or stroke, especially at higher doses. 
 
 “As always, consumers must carefully read the Drug Facts label for all nonprescription drugs. Consumers should carefully consider whether the drug is right for them, and use the medicine only as directed. Take the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time possible,” Mahoney says. 
 
 When using prescription NSAIDs, read the consumer-friendly Medication Guide attached to your filled prescription, which provides important safety information. 
 
 If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, consult a health care provider before using an NSAID. Balance the benefits of NSAIDs with the possible risks and weigh your options. If you take low-dose aspirin for protection against heart attack and stroke, you should know that some NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and naproxen, can interfere with that protective effect. 
 
 Stop taking NSAIDs and seek medical help if you experience symptoms that might signal heart problems or stroke, such as chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden weakness in one part or side of the body, or sudden slurred speech. 
 
 Reduce your risk factors for heart disease and stroke. “Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes are significant risk factors for these conditions,” Mahoney says. “If you smoke, work on quitting. See your doctor regularly to find out if you have these other strong risk factors, and commit yourself to taking care of them and of your health.”

 back to top ||||| The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is strengthening an existing label warning that non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke. Based on our comprehensive review of new safety information, we are requiring updates to the drug labels of all prescription NSAIDs. As is the case with current prescription NSAID labels, the Drug Facts labels of over-the-counter (OTC) non-aspirin NSAIDs already contain information on heart attack and stroke risk. We will also request updates to the OTC non-aspirin NSAID Drug Facts labels. 
 
 Patients taking NSAIDs should seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, weakness in one part or side of their body, or slurred speech. 
 
 NSAIDs are widely used to treat pain and fever from many different long- and short-term medical conditions such as arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, colds, and the flu. NSAIDs are available by prescription and OTC. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and celecoxib (see Table 1 for a list of NSAIDs). 
 
 The risk of heart attack and stroke with NSAIDs, either of which can lead to death, was first described in 2005 in the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions sections of the prescription drug labels. Since then, we have reviewed a variety of new safety information on prescription and OTC NSAIDs, including observational studies,1 a large combined analysis of clinical trials,2 and other scientific publications.1 These studies were also discussed at a joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee held on February 10-11, 2014. 
 
 Based on our review and the advisory committees’ recommendations, the prescription NSAID labels will be revised to reflect the following information: 
 
 The risk of heart attack or stroke can occur as early as the first weeks of using an NSAID. The risk may increase with longer use of the NSAID. 
 
 The risk appears greater at higher doses. 
 
 It was previously thought that all NSAIDs may have a similar risk. Newer information makes it less clear that the risk for heart attack or stroke is similar for all NSAIDs; however, this newer information is not sufficient for us to determine that the risk of any particular NSAID is definitely higher or lower than that of any other particular NSAID. 
 
 NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in patients with or without heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. A large number of studies support this finding, with varying estimates of how much the risk is increased, depending on the drugs and the doses studied. 
 
 In general, patients with heart disease or risk factors for it have a greater likelihood of heart attack or stroke following NSAID use than patients without these risk factors because they have a higher risk at baseline. 
 
 Patients treated with NSAIDs following a first heart attack were more likely to die in the first year after the heart attack compared to patients who were not treated with NSAIDs after their first heart attack. 
 
 There is an increased risk of heart failure with NSAID use. 
 
 We will request similar updates to the existing heart attack and stroke risk information in the Drug Facts labels of OTC non-aspirin NSAIDs. 
 
 In addition, the format and language contained throughout the labels of prescription NSAIDs will be updated to reflect the newest information available about the NSAID class. 
 
 Patients and health care professionals should remain alert for heart-related side effects the entire time that NSAIDs are being taken. We urge you to report side effects involving NSAIDs to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the “Contact FDA” box at the bottom of the page.","– The FDA advised back in 2005 that non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, could up the risk of heart attack and stroke. But the agency is now boosting that warning, noting that drugs like ibuprofen (often sold under the Motrin IB brand), naproxen (Aleve), and celecoxib (Celebrex) may pose a risk even in small amounts and that these drugs should be used sparingly and for short periods, the New York Times reports. (Aspirin, although an NSAID, doesn't pose the same risk, the FDA notes.) Although an FDA review found that higher doses increased the risk of heart attack or stroke—and the risk may increase with length of use—""there is no period of use shown to be without risk,"" an FDA deputy director says. And while people with cardiovascular disease are more at risk for being adversely affected by NSAIDs, ""everyone may be at risk—even people without an underlying risk for cardiovascular disease,"" the FDA rep says. NSAIDs decrease production of prostaglandins, chemicals spewed out after an injury that trigger inflammation, WNCN reports. Per the FDA review, over-the-counter NSAIDs could up the risk of heart attack and stroke by about 10%, low-dose prescription meds by 20%, and higher-dose prescription NSAIDs by 50%, with ""significant variability"" in each estimate, an Emory University medical professor tells the Times. One NSAID, Vioxx, was taken off shelves in 2004 after being linked to 140,000 heart attacks over a five-year period, Bloomberg notes. The director of Northwestern University's Center for Communication and Health says that ""one of the underlying messages (is) there are no completely safe pain relievers, period."" How to cut down on potential NSAID risks, per the Harvard Health Blog: Take the lowest dose that works, limit how long you take it, and never take more than one NSAID at once.

 The City Council voted to fund nonprofit organizations to provide job training, counseling, tattoo removal and other services that aim to help people leave the gang life. The city would pay at least $4.5 million but no more than $30 million over four years. 
 
 The proposal “creates an innovative pathway for individuals served with gang injunctions to gain the job skills they need to turn their lives around,” City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. 
 
 If a court approves the settlement, the city also will stop enforcing curfew restrictions that a federal court ruled were unconstitutional and provide an expedited way for people named in injunctions to be removed from the list. 
 
 “Unconstitutional gang injunction curfews forced several thousand black and brown residents of Los Angeles indoors on a nightly basis,” Olu K. Orange, an attorney for the lawsuit plaintiffs, said in a statement. “These individuals are part of the Los Angeles community and this settlement is a step by city leaders toward showing them that their lives do matter.” 
 
 Gang injunctions were designed as a tool for fighting gang crime and violence. They give police the power to arrest reputed gang members named in the injunction for otherwise legal activities such as gathering in public, wearing gang colors or being outside in a specified gang area late at night. 
 
 Since being pioneered in Los Angeles in the 1980s, the use of the injunctions has proliferated across the nation and even overseas. Vast swaths of Southern California have been subject to such injunctions. 
 
 Advocates say the injunctions have reduced gang crime while opponents say they cast too wide a net and unfairly brand young men as gang members without due process. Courts have struck down portions of gang injunctions in Ventura and Orange counties. 
 
 The proposed Los Angeles settlement covers a lawsuit that was filed in 2011 by two men who were arrested for violating curfew restrictions in an injunction. The men denied they were gang members and charges against them eventually were dismissed. 
 
 Their lawsuit argued that the arrests violated their constitutional rights to free assembly, travel and protection from unlawful seizures. 
 
 “Gang injunctions are a form of psychological abuse on a whole generation of young people of color,” one of the men, Christian Rodriguez, said in a statement. “Because I was wrongly labeled as a gang member, I couldn’t even be outside helping my mom with the groceries at night. I got involved in this case to help others who like me, did nothing wrong but unjustly live in constant fear of doing something that might be perceived by a member of LAPD as a violation.”

 Disqus","– Los Angeles will have to pay up to $30 million to provide gang members with job training, tattoo removal, and more after settling a class-action lawsuit this week, the Los Angeles Times reports. The city was sued in 2011 for enforcing curfews—part of the city's widespread gang injunctions—despite them being declared illegal by a California appeals court in 2007. There are nearly 50 gang injunctions around Los Angeles prohibiting suspected gang members from carrying weapons, wearing certain clothes, or socializing with certain groups; 21 of those injunctions require suspected gang members to be inside by 10pm. Critics say the curfews are too broadly defined and unfairly labeled young people as gang members without proof or a trial, according to the AP. If the settlement agreement is approved by the court, the city will pay between $4.5 million and $30 million into a nonprofit it created to help those victimized by curfews. The amount depends on how many of the approximately 5,700 people covered by the curfews come forward. The Los Angeles city attorney says the nonprofit will allow gang members ""to gain the job skills they need to turn their lives around."" As part of the agreement, the city will stop enforcing the curfews. “Gang injunctions are a form of psychological abuse on a whole generation of young people of color,” the AP quotes one man arrested for violating curfew. “Because I was wrongly labeled as a gang member, I couldn’t even be outside helping my mom with the groceries at night.""","<pad> – The city agreed Wednesday to spend up to $30 million to settle a lawsuit that challenged widespread injunctions that restrict the movement of thousands of suspected gang members.

 A Facebook page affiliated with the Syrian opposition posted images on Wednesday claiming to show young Syrian children in the area of Idlib, in northern Syria. They’re holding paper signs with pictures of Pokemon characters, and calling on people to save them. 
 
 “I am in Kafr Nabl on the outskirts of Idlib, come and save me,” one sign says, echoing phrases on a handful of others. “I am in Kafr Zeta, save me,” one reads. “I am Kafr Nabouda, save me,” urges another. 
 
 https://twitter.com/syria_children/status/755896915854843905 
 
 It’s unclear who, or what group, was behind the images. But they bear the logo of the RFS, which is self-described online as the Revolutionary Forces of Syria Media Office that “reports on the Syrian revolution professionally and objectively,” according to its Twitter account. It appears to be affiliated with the Syrian opposition. The images were also circulated by other accounts affiliated with the opposition, which has been fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his regime since 2011. 
 
 “I never imagined we would like to become a game in order to gain the world’s attention,” a Twitter account called Children of Syria posted on Wednesday, with the pictures of the children. 
 
 The effort specifically sought to draw attention to the situation in the vicinity of Idlib, a rebel-held city in northeastern Syria that has been hit heavily by regime-led airstrikes. On Wednesday, the same day the images of the children holding the posters were circulated, Sky News Arabia reported that more than 50 people were killed by airstrikes in the city within the last 24 hours. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on its website that warplanes struck neighborhoods in eight raids, and helicopters dropped explosive barrels on Tuesday in two towns in the southern countryside of Idlib. 
 
 It’s just one area suffering from ongoing combat. UNICEF said it estimates 35,000 children are trapped in and around the Syrian city of Manbij, about 100 miles northeast of Idlib. “In the past six weeks, and as violence has intensified, over 2,300 people were reportedly killed in the area, among them dozens of children,” UNICEF said in a statement on Wednesday. A video that surfaced this week showed a 12-year-old boy brutally beheaded near Aleppo. 
 
 In April, a U.N. special envoy for Syria said some 400,000 people have died in the conflict since it started in 2011.

 In another Pokémon-focused initiative aimed at grabbing attention, Syrian artist Saif Aldeen Tahhan posted images last week on his Facebook account showing six images of Poké Balls pictured with symbols of what Syrians need after years of war: homes, first aid kits, school books, and life rafts for Syrian refugees. 
 
 “The world is buzzing with this game, and I told myself, why not show our pain?” Tahhan told Al Arabiya. “They are looking for the Pokémon, but the Syrian people are looking for how to live right now.” 
 
 According to Al Arabiya, Tahhan left Syria for Denmark a year and a half ago. ||||| Tweet with a location

 Pokémon Go’s augmented reality technology projects digital creatures on to the streets around a player as viewed on a smartphone. 
 
 It has proved enormously popular, sometimes dangerously so as players staring at their screens have paid little heed to the real world they are moving through. 
 
 Players in Bosnia have been urged to avoid areas littered with unexploded mines left over from the 1990s conflict, and Indonesian police detained a French man who trespassed on a military base while playing the game. 
 
 There have been a string of reports of less dramatic problems across America: one woman got stuck in a tree in a New Jersey cemetery, a Baltimore man drove into a police car, and a man in New Hampshire was robbed at knifepoint. 
 
 The game’s popularity has also provoked religious controversy, with Saudi Arabia’s top clerical body reviving a 2001 religious edict prohibiting Pokémon.","– Children in war-torn Syria are holding pictures of Pokemon in the hopes the rest of the world, currently obsessing over Pokemon Go, will take notice, the Independent reports. According to Vocativ, photos of the children started circulating online Wednesday, the same day airstrikes in the city of Idlib killed more than 50 people. In addition to pictures of Pokemon, the children's signs bear messages like ""I am here, come save me"" along with their location. Most of the children appear to be near Idlib and another city, Hama, the Guardian reports. Those cities have seen years of fighting between the Syrian government and opposition forces. “I never imagined we would like to become a game in order to gain the world’s attention,” Vocativ quotes a Twitter account called Children of Syria.

188,"Labor and business leaders have agreed in principle on the details of a new visa program for low-skilled foreign workers, clearing the last major hurdle for a bipartisan Senate proposal to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, a person involved in the negotiations said Saturday. 
 
 The agreement came late Friday after several days of negotiations between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, the country’s largest labor organization, as well as the eight senators involved in drafting the comprehensive immigration bill. 
 
 The two sides agreed on how to overcome the final sticking points, including how much the foreign workers would be paid and which industries would be exempt from the guest-worker program. Final approval came in a phone call Friday night arranged by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) with Chamber president Thomas Donohue and AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka, said the person involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 
 
 Trumka said in a statement Saturday night: “We have created a new model, a modern visa system that includes both a bureau to collect and analyze labor market data, as well as significant worker protections.” He also reiterated the AFL-CIO’s support for the overall reform effort, including the path to citizenship for undocumented migrants. 
 
 But the complexity of the matter was highlighted when one member of the business community said Saturday afternoon that the lead negotiators on the business side had not seen written details of a final agreement and cautioned that declaring the matter resolved was premature. 
 
 “Business groups are still waiting to see the details. I don’t know where it’s coming from,” the business official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. “I don’t want to blow this up at all, but to say everyone’s signed off on this is getting ahead of ourselves.” 
 
 Members of the Senate working group also declined to confirm the deal. Alex Conant, a spokesman for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), wrote on his Twitter account, “Senate negotiators are making good progress on immigration reform, but we’re not done yet.” 
 
 A spokesman for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) declined to comment Saturday. 
 
 The person who disclosed the guest-worker deal said that all eight senators had not formally signed off on the terms but said that could happen over the next few days because all had been briefed at each stage of the talks. 
 
 The guest-worker dispute was considered the final major impasse that threatened to delay the immigration bill that the Senate working group hopes to unveil in the second week of April. Senate aides, who will begin writing the hundreds of pages of legislation this week, cautioned that nothing in the deal is final until the four Democrats and four Republicans in the group have agreed to all portions of the written document. 
 
 In addition to the guest-worker program, the Senate bill will feature a 13-year path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, increases in the number of visas for highly skilled tech workers, elimination of some categories of family visas and increases in border control and workplace security, people familiar with the talks have said. 
 
 Though a number of smaller points are unresolved, Senate aides said they are hopeful that a bill can be introduced in the Judiciary Committee in time to be moved onto the Senate floor by Memorial Day. The goal would be to have a vote of the full Senate by the August recess, the aides said. The House has a proposal developed by its own bipartisan group that also could be unveiled in the next few weeks. 
 
 President Obama, who has made immigration reform the top priority of his second term, has said he hopes to sign a comprehensive bill this year. In 2007, a dispute between business and labor over a guest-worker provision helped sink a bipartisan immigration bill in the Senate. The president has not taken a position on a guest-worker program this year. 
 
 According to the person who disclosed the guest-worker deal, Schumer called White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to inform him of the deal. The administration had mostly remained out of the daily negotiations as business and labor tried to work out the deal under the Senate’s guidance. 
 
 A White House spokesman said in a statement Saturday that the president “continues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of Senators,” adding, “We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced, and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible.” 
 
 Businesses had lobbied for 400,000 new visas under the new program, but labor unions wanted far fewer because of concerns that such a system would negatively affect wages and benefits for American workers. 
 
 Under the Senate’s proposal, businesses would be allowed starting in April 2015 to hire 20,000 foreign workers for low-skilled jobs in a new “W visa” program — the number rising to 75,000 in 2019, according to people familiar with the details. 
 
 After that, the number would rise and fall each year depending on recommendations from a new “Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research,” which would analyze employment data. Those familiar with the talks said it would take many years before the visa program would approach the annual proposed cap of 200,000 foreign workers. 
 
 Meanwhile, construction industries would be limited to no more than 15,000 visas annually and would be banned from hiring any foreign guest workers for more highly skilled technical jobs such as electrician positions. 
 
 The Chamber and AFL-CIO agreed to a wage scale that would pay foreigners the greater of actual or prevailing wages. It would be based partly on a formula that takes into account actual wages paid by the employer to similarly situated U.S. workers, as well as regional and industry scales. 
 
 Companies, except in the construction industry, could hire workers beyond the annual caps if they were willing to pay significantly higher wages. 
 
 Union officials declined to comment Saturday. Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokeswoman for the Chamber, confirmed that Schumer and Donohue spoke Friday but said she did not know whether Donohue had spoken with Trumka. She declined to comment on whether a deal had been reached. 
 
 “The senators will make the decisions about any final agreements and what makes the best public policy overall,” Holmes said in an e-mail. 
 
 Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums. ||||| The accord between the influential business and labor groups all but assured that the bipartisan group of senators would introduce their broad immigration legislation in the next few weeks. Their bill, which they have been meeting about several times a week since the November election, would provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country. It would also take steps to secure the nation’s borders.

 A similar bipartisan group in the House has been meeting on and off for nearly four years, and hopes to unveil its own immigration legislation shortly. 
 
 The agreement resolved what the pay level should be for low-skilled immigrants — often employed at hotels and restaurants or on construction projects — who could be brought in during labor shortages. 
 
 Labor groups wanted to ensure that guest workers would not be paid less than the median wage in their respective industries, and the two sides compromised by agreeing that guest workers would be paid the higher of the prevailing industry wage as determined by the Labor Department or the actual employer wage.

 Under the deal, guest workers would be allowed to pursue a path to citizenship and to change jobs after they arrived in the United States. 
 
 Another sticking point, involving the specific type of jobs that would be included in the guest worker program, was also resolved. Though low-skilled construction workers will be included in the visa program, construction unions persuaded the negotiators to exclude certain types of more skilled jobs — like crane operators and electricians — from the program, officials involved in the talks said. 
 
 According to officials with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the program would start at 20,000 visas, rising to 35,000 visas in the second year, 55,000 in the third and 75,000 in the fourth. In the fifth year, the program would expand or shrink based on the unemployment rate, the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers and various other factors. The agreement calls for a maximum of 200,000 guest visas granted each year.

 One third of all visas available in any given year would go to businesses with fewer than 25 employees. No more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction occupations. 
 
 Business groups, which had long been pushing to allow in 400,000 such guest workers each year, will get what they regard as an adequate number to meet the needs of employers. 
 
 Mr. Schumer also spoke on Saturday with Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to update him on the agreement. President Obama is eager for an overhaul of the immigration system and has threatened to step in with his own plan if Congress does not move quickly with legislation of its own.

 “The president continues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators,” said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman. “We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced, and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible.” 
 
 But Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a member of the bipartisan group, sent a letter Saturday to Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urging against “excessive haste” in considering the soon-to-be-introduced legislation. The support of voters will be crucial for passing any immigration law, Mr. Rubio said in the letter, and “that support can only be earned through full and careful consideration of legislative language and an open process of amendments.” 
 
 Shortly before the conference call on Friday night between Mr. Schumer, Mr. Donohue and Mr. Trumka ended, one of the men suggested that the three of them get together soon for dinner; it had been, they all agreed, a long few weeks.","– America's top labor and business groups reached an agreement last night over the final sticking point in overhauling the country's immigration laws, the Washington Post reports.

189,"A new project seeks to kickstart a revival for the world’s largest rainforest by planting new trees — tens of millions of them. 
 
 The project, announced Friday at the “Rock in Rio” music fest in Brazil, aims to restore 73 million trees in the Brazilian Amazon by 2023. Spanning 30,000 hectares of land (about 74,000 acres), the project is the largest tropical forest restoration in the world and helps Brazil move towards its Paris Agreement target of reforesting 12 million hectares of land by 2030. 
 
 “This is a breathtakingly audacious project,” said M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International (CI), one of the partners behind the effort. “The fate of the Amazon depends on getting this right — as do the region’s 25 million residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.” 
 
 The Amazon forest is home to the richest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planet — a recent report described some 400 new species discovered in the Amazon between 2014 and 2015 alone — yet is rapidly vanishing with increasing global demand for resources. The economy, essentially focused on the exploitation of natural resources, minerals and agribusiness, has already led to about 20 percent of original forest cover to be replaced by pastures and agricultural crops, without securing the well-being of the local population. The reforestation project fills an urgent need to develop the region’s economy without destroying its forests and ensuring the well-being of its people.

 “A new chapter is being written for the Brazilian Amazon with this initiative,” said Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of CI’s Brazil office. “Protecting the Amazon is not something we should think in the future — we have to do it now.” 
 
 The project is a partnership between Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (Funbio) and Rock in Rio’s environmental arm “Amazonia Live.” 
 
 The reforestation effort is part of a broader regional initiative, the Amazonia Sustainable Landscapes Project. This project aims to increase the area of forest ecosystems, promote the connectivity of protected areas within the Amazon, and further develop local productive activities and value chains derived from the sustainable use of Amazonian biodiversity, including production of native species of seeds and seedlings. 
 
 Priority areas for the restoration effort include southern Amazonas, Rondônia, Acre, Pará and the Xingu watershed. Restoration activities will include the enrichment of existing secondary forest areas, sowing of selected native species, and, when necessary, direct planting of native species, Medeiros said.

 Further reading ||||| There are more habitable planets in our galaxy than humans living on planet Earth. But the nearest one is about 70 trillion miles away , which means that, for now, and for the foreseeable future, Earth is the only life-supporting rock hurtling through infinite space we’ll ever know. It’s really not the best idea to let it burn up–and key to keeping it cool are the massive rainforests of the Amazon. Sadly, we’ve had a hard time not cutting them down. 
 
 A new project should help prevent–or at least slow down–that hot future. If all goes to plan over the next six years, a project led by Conservation International will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history. Seventy-three million trees will sprout up across what’s known as the “arc of deforestation,” in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondônia, and throughout the Xingu watershed. The short-term plan is to restore 70,000 acres (the area of 30,000 soccer fields) that have been cleared for pastureland to their former forested glory. 
 
 
 
 “If the world is to hit the 1.2°C or 2°C [degrees of warming] target that we all agreed to in Paris, then protecting tropical forests in particular has to be a big part of that,” M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, tells Fast Company. “It’s not just the trees that matter, but what kind of trees. If you’re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most.” 
 
 He’s right: Simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to absorb up to 37% of our annual carbon emissions; replenishing degraded areas could do significantly more for the planet. 
 
 “This is not a stunt,” Sanjayan says. “It is a carefully controlled experiment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale, so that people can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically.” 
 
 Over the past 40 years, about 20% of the Amazon has been cut down or destroyed, and scientists worry that another 20% of the rainforest will be lost in the next couple of decades. So, instead of following precedent and planting saplings, which are labor and resource intensive to manage (and, depending on the selected species, may not be best-suited for the territory, resulting in less than ideal survival rates), the organizing coalition is trying something different. 
 
 
 
 Developed in Brazil only a few years ago, the new planting technique is called muvuca. “In Portuguese, it means a lot of people in a very small place,” says Rodrigo Medeiros, Conservation International’s vice president of the Brazil program and the lead on the ground. 
 
 ||||| Assuming everything goes to plan, over the next six years, the Amazon rainforest will get 73 million new trees. The mass planting is part of a project sponsored by Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, and a number of other NGOs and corporations. As John Converse Townsend at Fast Company reports, it is the largest tropical reforestation effort ever attempted. 
 
 According to a press release from Conservation International, the effort will span deforested pasture lands over a 74,000-acre region spanning several Brazilian states—with the greatest focus in Southern Amazonas, Rondônia, Acre, Pará and the Xingu watershed. The purpose of the project is, in part, to revive the 20 percent of the Amazon that has been lost to deforestation due to agriculture and pasturing during the last 40 years. But the effort is also geared toward learning how to restore tropical forests. 
 
 “This is a breathtakingly audacious project,” says M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, according to the release. “The fate of the Amazon depends on getting this right—as do the region’s 25 million residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.” 
 
 As Townsend reports, reforestation efforts are typically very costly and time consuming—requiring people to both grow and plant thousands of saplings, many of which will not survive. In this latest effort, the restorationists are trying a new method called muvuca, in which they will spread the seeds of native trees across the slash and burned land and animal pastures. The seeds come from the Xingu Seed Network, which uses a coalition of 400 collectors to gather the seeds from native trees. 
 
 “With plant-by-plant reforestation techniques, you get a typical density of about 160 plants per hectare,” Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of Conservation International’s Brazil program, tells Townsend. “With muvuca, the initial outcome is 2,500 [trees] per hectare. And after 10 years, you can reach 5,000 trees per hectare. It’s much more diverse, much more dense, and less expensive than traditional techniques.” 
 
 The muvuca experiment is the beginning of a massive effort announced by Brazil to restore 12 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Pennsylvania, as part of an effort to reach their climate change goals under the Paris Accord. Recent studies show that second growth forests—those less than 60 years old that grow after logging or land clearance—can sequester huge amounts of carbon. As Townsend reports, just stopping current deforestation could help mitigate 37 percent of current carbon emissions. Planting or restoring forests could make that number even bigger. 
 
 While the effort is impressive, it’s not the largest reforestation effort in the world. In July, 2016, 800,000 people in Uttar Pradesh, India, planted 50 million trees in just 24 hours, a publicity stunt to highlight India’s Paris Accord commitment to reforest 12 percent of its land by 2030. The world’s largest program, however, is China’s Grain-for-Green effort, a plan to restore 69.2 million acres of forest land, which is an area the size of New York and Pennsylvania combined. 
 
 All of these efforts are encouraging, but replanting is only half of the solution. Twenty-five million acres of forests are cleared each year, writes Doug Boucher, Director of Climate Research and Analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He points out that while the long-term benefits of reforestation are helpful for the climate, the decades it takes for forests to regrow means it will take a while to see benefits. This means other more immediate solutions, such as reducing industrial emissions and halting the removal of forests, are still necessary to make a dent in our changing climate.","– The Amazon rainforest's ""arc of deforestation"" could soon have 73 million new trees. In an effort to reseed 74,000 acres of the Amazon—20% of which has been destroyed in the last 40 years—Conservation International, the World Bank, Brazil's environmental ministry, and several other groups are working together to spread seeds in the Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondonia, and Xingu areas of Brazil, reports Fast Company. Reforestation normally involves saplings, which must be grown and planted. But Conservation International CEO M. Sanjayan hopes dropping seeds from 200 native species per square meter of land, in what is known as the muvuca strategy, will ""drive the costs down dramatically"" and produce a greater diversity and density of plants. ""If you're really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of [the] atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most,"" says Sanjayan, noting the move will help Brazil reach its Paris Accord target of reforesting an area the size of Pennsylvania by 2030, per Smithsonian. A release notes it's the ""largest tropical forest restoration in the world."" Up to 2,000 locals will work together to seed each hectare, with families receiving $700 per hectare. Additional seeds will also be distributed in existing forested areas. Some 90% of seeds are expected to germinate, though only the strongest will survive. A leader of the program predicts there will be 2,500 trees per hectare after six years and up to 5,000 after 10 years.

 Ertharin Cousin, head of the U.N.'s World Food Program, said that while some food aid is flowing in, fighting around major ports is stalling deliveries, while reaching the country's interior is proving difficult and donor funding is still falling short. 
 
 ""If we do not receive the additional access that is required to meet the needs of those who are affected by this ongoing conflict, if we cannot support the commercial markets by ensuring that the ports are open and providing food to ensure that those who have resources can buy the food that is necessary, and if we do not see increased donor support, we are facing the perfect storm in Yemen,"" she told reporters in Cairo. 
 
 Cousin was in Cairo following a three-day trip to Yemen. The WFP says all sides in the conflict must approve food deliveries. 
 
 U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien, who also just returned from Yemen, told the U.N. Security Council ""the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible."" 
 
 He said he was shocked by what he saw: Four out of five Yemenis are in need of humanitarian assistance, nearly 1.5 million people are internally displaced, and people were using cardboard for mattresses at a hospital where lights flickered, the blood bank had closed and there were no more examination gloves. 
 
 Yemen's conflict pits Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh against southern separatists, local and tribal militias, Sunni Islamic militants and troops loyal to President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who is in exile in Saudi Arabia. 
 
 The humanitarian situation has steadily deteriorated since the fighting picked up in March, when Saudi Arabia launched a U.S.-backed coalition air campaign against Houthi forces and their allies, which control large swaths of the country, including the capital. 
 
 Saudi Arabia views the Houthis as a proxy of its arch rival, Shiite powerhouse Iran, and an attempt to expand its influence on the Arabian Peninsula. Iran supports the Houthis politically but denies arming them. 
 
 Pro-government forces pushed the rebels out of the southern port city of Aden last month and have made gains in the surrounding provinces. But their advance stalled on Tuesday after a rebel ambush killed dozens of fighters. 
 
 Since August, the food program says it has been able to make 16 deliveries via sea to Yemen, accounting for over 123,000 metric tons of food. But difficulties remain because of the fighting, which has caused port closures. The western port city of Hodeida was hit with airstrikes Tuesday night. 
 
 ""We actually had a ship berthed in port that was not damaged but had not been given clearance to offload when that bombing attack occurred,"" Cousin said. ""We're bringing in food from Hodeida that because of the conflict we can't get to the south. 
 
 ""We have right now, a ship sitting off the port of Aden that has materials in it that we could use in the south, and we're still waiting for permission for that ship to come in,"" she said, adding that in order to access the rest of the country, all the ports must be open. 
 
 Oxfam's country director, Philippe Clerc, said only two humanitarian vessels have been able to dock and off-load at the Hodeida port in the past more than two weeks. 
 
 O'Brien, the U.N. humanitarian chief, called the airstrikes and shelling at Hodeidah a violation of international humanitarian law, saying they damaged ""the main lifelines"" for importing crucial food, medicine and fuel and could severely impact the entire country. 
 
 Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, needs to import food even in peacetime. 
 
 The WFP estimates that nearly 13 million people in Yemen lack proper access to food, with 6 million, or one in five of the country's population, in urgent need of assistance. The organization is seeking financial support for a $320 million emergency operation program it expects to launch in September. 
 
 Other organizations also registered alarm on Wednesday over the desperate situation in Yemen. 
 
 The U.N.'s humanitarian office says to 4,500 people have been killed and a further 23,000 have been wounded to date, many of them civilians. 
 
 Human Rights Watch and 22 other human rights and humanitarian organizations said that the U.N.'s Human Rights Council should create a commission of inquiry to investigate allegations of war crimes by all parties since September 2014. 
 
 In Geneva, the head of the International Red Cross said: ""Yemen after five months looks like Syria after five years.""

 Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer contributed to this report from the United Nations. ||||| The conflict in Yemen has killed nearly 400 children since the end of March, and a similar number of children have been recruited by armed groups, according to a new report by the UN children's agency. 
 
 
 
 UNICEF's report released on Wednesday, says that 398 children have been killed and 377 others have been recruited to fight since the Saudi-led coalition began air strikes in Yemen. 
 
 ""This conflict is a particular tragedy for Yemeni children,"" Julien Harneis, UNICEF Representative in Yemen, said. 
 
 ""Children are being killed by bombs or bullets and those that survive face the growing threat of disease and malnutrition. This cannot be allowed to continue,"" he added. 
 
 The UN said that as devastating as the conflict is for the lives of children, it will have terrifying consequences for their future. 
 
 On Wednesday, Amnesty International, said that all sides fighting in Yemen have left a ""trail of civilian death and destruction"" in the conflict, killing scores of innocent people in what could amount to war crimes. 
 
 The London-based rights group said the violence has been particularly deadly in the southern city of Aden and in Taiz, with dozens of children among those killed. 
 
 Yemen's conflict pits the Houthis and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh against forces including southern separatists, tribal fighters and troops backing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is in exile in Saudi Arabia. 
 
 The Saudis are leading a US-backed Arab coalition that is carrying out air strikes against Houthi fighters since March. 
 
 
 
 Civilian death toll 
 
 Overall, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday, at least 1,950 civilians have been killed in the fighting and 1,3 million others have fled their homes. 
 
 One minute Yemen 
 
 The UN and aid groups have called repeatedly for ways to get food, fuel, medicine and other supplies into Yemen, but tight restrictions imposed by the coalition on air and sea transport remain in place, while Yemen's exiled government accuses the Houthis of hijacking aid. 
 
 Yemen is the poorest country in the Arab world, and its population relies on imports for about 90 percent of its supplies. Attempts at UN-brokered humanitarian pauses to bring in aid have failed. 
 
 The new UNICEF report says about 10 million children, or half of the country's population, need urgent humanitarian assistance. 
 
 It also says more than half a million pregnant women in Yemen's hardest-hit areas are at higher risk for birth or pregnancy complications because they cannot get to medical facilities ||||| SANA’A/ADEN - Seeing first-hand the challenges facing millions of people affected by the crisis in Yemen, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director Ertharin Cousin, warned that lack of immediate and unhindered access to people who urgently need food assistance and the shortage of funding create the possibility of famine for millions, mostly women and children already hungry in this war-torn country. 
 
 The conflict exacerbates the country’s extremely fragile food security situation. WFP estimates that the number of food insecure people in Yemen is now close to 13 million, including 6 million who are severely food insecure and in urgent need of external assistance – that is one in five of the country’s population. 
 
 “Right now, the conflict-driven convergence between the lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply create the dawn of a perfect storm for the most vulnerable Yemeni people,” said Ertharin Cousin, WFP Executive Director. 
 
 “The disruption in the commercial food sector creates significant reductions in imports which causes an inflationary effect on market prices for food and other basic commodities. As a result, we are starting to see a double effect of the conflict as even the people who could previously afford to meet their food needs are today unable to buy food.” 
 
 During a three-day visit, Cousin, travelled to Sana’a, Amran and Aden. She met with displaced families taking refuge in school buildings, mothers and their young malnourished children at health centres and hospitals, as well as families at food distribution sites. She also held meetings with the authorities on both sides of the frontlines, WFP staff, UN sister agencies and NGO partners. 
 
 More than 1.2 million children are suffering from moderate acute malnutrition and over half a million children are severely malnourished. “The damage to Yemen’s next generation may become irreversible if we don’t reach children quickly with the right food at the right time. We must act now before it is too late,” said Cousin. 
 
 The recent fighting around major ports will stall the commercial and humanitarian supplies to the country mainly food and fuel. Shortages of fuel are not only impacting the food distribution system of both the humanitarian and the private sector but will have a devastating effect on access to clean water, health, electricity and other basic services. 
 
 WFP has reached 3.5 million people with food since the beginning of the conflict but the fighting makes deliveries difficult and dangerous. Many road networks in the hardest hit areas of the country are still not operational, making communities in conflict-areas inaccessible for aid workers. 
 
 A recent vulnerability assessment conducted by WFP using mobile phone technology, reaching some of the households in areas inaccessible by teams on the ground, reflected that the deteriorating food security situation is particularly affecting the internally displaced families. Many families are existing on bread, rice and tea. The most common themes mentioned by the people interviewed for the assessment are “high food prices”, “shortages”, “lack of water” and a “deteriorating” situation. 
 
 The assessment showed that emergency food security conditions currently prevail in conflict-affected governorates. This phase is one step away from famine levels. Food insecurity is most severe for the country’s 1.3 million internally displaced people. 
 
 Shortage of drinking water is a critical issue. The price of water in Sana’a had tripled since the start of the conflict because pumping systems have been hit by the lack of diesel fuel. Water is critical for families to prepare food and has an impact on people keeping livestock, which is very important for livelihoods in the country. 
 
 An emergency operation planned to start in September is expected to cost some US$320 million for a period of six months. WFP implores the entire global community to recognize the urgency of the Yemeni crisis, with a specific call to those who have made commitments to expeditiously fulfil their pledges. WFP is grateful to the donors who have financially contributed or pledged support to the Yemen response including the European Commission (ECHO), Germany, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

 Yemen's conflict has left it on the brink of famine, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) has warned. 
 
 Food shortages, lack of fresh water, and low fuel stocks have created a ""perfect storm"" for the Yemeni people, the WFP's Ertharin Cousin said. 
 
 The organisation estimates nearly 13 million people urgently require help. 
 
 The conflict has involved Houthi rebel fighters clashing with forces loyal to the Yemeni government and its allies, led by Saudi Arabia. 
 
 Ms Cousin, who was speaking after a three-day trip to Yemen. said aid agencies were unable to reach areas of need because of the ongoing violence. 
 
 Yemen Crisis Four months of fighting between Houthi rebels and government forces, and Saudi-led coalition air strikes, have left the impoverished country in chaos 80% of the population need aid 
 
 13m people face food shortages 
 
 1.4m forced from their homes 
 
 2,000 civilians killed 
 
 She warned of ""irreversible"" damage unless food could reach the estimated 1.2m children suffering malnutrition. 
 
 A recent WFP assessment of food security on the ground concluded Yemen was ""one step away"" from famine. 
 
 In the latest violence, a bomb exploded next to the governor's office in the southern city of Aden, killing four people. 
 
 Sally Nabil, BBC correspondent in Aden 
 
 Although the fighting is over, the humanitarian situation in Aden remains dire. Pro-government forces have driven out the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels but the people are in desperate need. 
 
 Many of the residential neighbourhoods have been reduced to ruins and thousands of Yemenis are still living in schools and mosques, with little access to food, water or medicine. There is no sign they are going to return home any time soon. 
 
 A lot of areas around the city are full of landmines and explosive devices. One lady told me her neighbour went back to check his house after the fighting stopped, but the moment he opened the door an explosion was triggered. She said she doesn't want to face the same fate. 
 
 As we walked around Aden, we saw some neighbourhoods overflowing with sewage water. Parents say their children are suffering from malaria, diarrhoea and skin diseases. 
 
 Hospitals are overwhelmed with war casualties who don't receive adequate medical treatment. Many die on their way to the medical facilities because ambulances are poorly equipped. Doctors say many victims need to be taken abroad because their conditions are too serious to be treated in Yemen. 
 
 Last month, government forces retook Aden from the Houthis in a major setback for the rebels. 
 
 Meanwhile, UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien, who has also just returned from Yemen, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that ""the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible"". 
 
 He also strongly criticised the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for bombing the port of Hodeida, saying it was a violation of international humanitarian law. 
 
 Image copyright EPA Image caption Gulf states intervened in Yemen in a bid to restore the exiled government's control 
 
 A WFP ship was in the port, which is on the country's west coast, when it was hit by air strikes on Tuesday night. 
 
 ""I am extremely concerned that the damage to the port of Hodeida could have a severe impact on the entire country and will deepen humanitarian needs,"" Mr O'Brien said. 
 
 The UN has raised Yemen to its highest level of humanitarian crisis, placing it alongside emergencies in South Sudan, Syria and Iraq. 
 
 Nearly 2,000 civilians are said to have died since the coalition began its bombing campaign in support of the exiled government in March. 
 
 What makes a famine? 
 
 As grim as the humanitarian situation is in Yemen, the WFP stops short of declaring a famine there in its latest update. 
 
 The UN uses the term sparingly and will only declare a famine once certain conditions are met. 
 
 They are: over 20% of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope; acute malnutrition rates exceed 30%; and the death rate exceeds two per day per 10,000 people. 
 
 Calling the situation in Yemen a famine would instantly raise awareness, but that labelling makes little difference to the Yemeni people already suffering. 
 
 The UN says a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" is under way, and has called for urgent support from donors. 
 
 Why is there fighting in Yemen? 
 
 Image copyright AFP 
 
 Northern Shia Muslim rebels known as Houthis, backed by forces loyal to Yemen's ex-president, took over parts of Yemen, including Sanaa, and forced the government into exile in March 
 
 The rebels accused the government of corruption and of planning to marginalise their heartland within a proposed federal system 
 
 Forces loyal to the government, and southern militia, are fighting back, aided by air strikes led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia 
 
 Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? 
 
 Meeting the Houthis and their enemies ||||| 21 July 2011  For many months United Nations aid agencies have warned of an impending crisis in the Horn of Africa as drought, failed harvests and fighting in some areas led to increasing food insecurity. Now conditions are so grim that the UN has turned to a word it uses sparingly and specifically – famine. 
 
 Yesterday the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) declared that a famine exists in two regions of southern Somalia, and warned that the famine could soon spread to the rest of southern Somalia. 
 
 While many countries worldwide face food security crises, with large numbers of people hungry and unable to find enough food, only rarely do the conditions meet the humanitarian community’s formal criteria for a famine. The last time it was used in Somalia, for example, was in 1991-92, despite several periods of protracted drought and other problems in the intervening years. 
 
 A famine can be declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. They are: at least 20 per cent of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope; acute malnutrition rates exceed 30 per cent; and the death rate exceeds two persons per day per 10,000 persons. 
 
 Other factors considered in these areas of Somalia include large-scale displacement, widespread destitution, disease outbreaks and social collapse. 
 
 The definition has been developed through the work of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which includes specialists from humanitarian agencies, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP), as well as leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Government aid agencies. 
 
 The gathering of data to determine whether the criteria are met is in this case in the hands of the UN-backed Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit-Somalia (FSNAU), which is administered by FAO. FSNAU then passes the information to the UN, aid agencies and the United States Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). 
 
 The declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or Member States, but serves to focus global attention on the problem. 
 
 According to WFP, famines have been declared previously in southern areas of Sudan in 2008; in Gode in the Somali region of Ethiopia in 2000; in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1996; in Somalia in 1991-1992, and Ethiopia in 1984-1985.","– Things continue to deteriorate in Yemen as the conflict between Houthi rebels and pro-government forces grinds on. But now there's a new problem in the mix: a possible famine, created by what Ertharin Cousin, the executive director of the UN's World Food Programme, calls a ""perfect storm"" of ""lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply."" In a press release, WFP estimates there are nearly 13 million of what it calls ""food insecure"" people in the war-torn country, with almost half in especially dire straits. That includes 1.2 million kids who suffer from ""moderate"" malnourishment and half a million who are severely affected. ""The damage to Yemen's next generation may become irreversible if we don't reach children quickly with the right food at the right time,"" Cousin says. ""We must act now before it is too late."" Cousin saw the crisis firsthand during a recent three-day trip around the country, where she met with displaced families, moms and malnourished kids in hospitals, and people gathered at food-distribution centers. The UN's humanitarian chief also recently returned from Yemen and told the UN Security Council yesterday that ""the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible,"" per the BBC. Semantics means the WFP can't call the situation a full-fledged famine just yet: Per the UN, a food crisis is only considered as such if one-fifth of households have limited ability to deal with ""extreme"" food shortages; acute malnutrition rates surpass 30%; and the daily death rate is more than two per every 10,000 people. Continued conflict in Yemeni ports has exacerbated the problem, the BBC notes, with a WFP ship hammered by airstrikes Tuesday night in Hodeida.

191,"Everyone, and I do mean everyone, is raving about how funny Saturday Night Live‘s ‘Black Jeopardy’ sketch was this week. If you like blacks being mocked for every stereotype under the sun, I guess you’ll find the 6 minutes a real howl worth gittin’ down wit. 
 
 The Washington Post headline read: “Forget Trump and Clinton. ‘Black Jeopardy’ is SNL’s best political sketch this year.” 
 
 ‘Black Jeopardy’ was replete with references to hot sauce, ‘Big (black) Girls,’ ‘Lives Matter’ — and of course, actor Tom Hanks playing Doug, a (racist, naturally) white Trump supporter. 
 
 The host Darnell, played by Kenan Thompson, announces that ‘Lives Matter’ would be the final category, to which the black contestants Keely and Shanice give Doug a stone-faced look. 
 
 “Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug,” chuckled Thompson. 
 
 “I’ve got a lot to say about this,” replied Hanks in a red-neck twang. 
 
 “Yeah, I’m sure you do,” quipped Thompson. “When we come back, we’ll play the national anthem and just see what the hell happens.” 
 
 Because now it’s a thing. Or should I say ‘thang’? Black professional athletes refusing to stand or taking a knee when the national anthem is played before games. 
 
 I admit I laughed when I watched the sketch, but later realized that Saturday Night Live would never have the audacity to produce a Jewish Jeopardy with categories like ‘Nazi Noodnicks,’ ‘Merchant of Venice’ or ‘Penny For Your Thoughts’––because it wouldn’t be considered funny, but rather anti-Semitic. If SNL is based on satire, why don’t we see the show mocking Jews and Jewish culture? 
 
 Yet, over and over again liberals think it’s okay to mock so-called “black culture” under the racist guise of comedy. Again, the notion being that all black people are one big, black stereotype, who vote Democrat, talk black, and hate white people. 
 
 Before ABC’s Blackish, there was Good Times, a sitcom about a black family living in a public housing project, and Sanford and Son, about black junk-yard dealer and his son. 
 
 “Black Jeopardy” has been a recent staple of SNL. This wasn’t the first installment. “Historically, the sketch has embellished black stereotypes and mocked white people’s political correctness,” wrote the Washington Post reporter Dan Zak. 
 
 Take note that Zak proudly juxtaposes the term “black stereotypes” with white people’s political correctness. What about white stereotypes? Zak, like SNL, gets away with this subtle racism because he’s a white liberal writing for a left-leaning publication. 
 
 The one stereotype missing from Black Jeopardy was any reference to blacks looting in the name of Black Lives Matter and getting away with it. Of course that would be HILARIOUS if it wasn’t such an ugly reality (Baltimore, Ferguson). When was the last time you saw riotous masses of white people, burning down their neighborhoods, and looting stores for flat screen TVs, cigarettes, hooch or toiletries?

 This is an opinion piece. The views expressed in this article are those of just the author. ||||| This SNL Black Jeopardy skit with Tom Hanks is as good as everyone says it is. And it’s not just funny either…it’s the rare SNL skit that works brilliantly as cultural commentary. Kudos to the writers on this one. 
 
 Update: Writing for Slate, Jamelle Bouie details why the Black Jeopardy sketch was so good; the title of the piece asks, “The Most Astute Analysis of American Politics in 2016?” ||||| ""Tom Hanks plays a Donald Trump supporter"" could’ve yielded some obvious (read: lazy) jokes when he hosted Saturday Night Live on October 22. Instead, the show made him play Black Jeopardy — and found a whole new way to talk about the nuances of this exhausting presidential election cycle. 
 
 The Black Jeopardy sketch has been recurring since 2014, usually throwing well-meaning but ultimately clueless white people into a game that caters to its black contestants. Past categories have included ""They Out Here Saying,"" ""If It’s Sunday,"" and ""Bruh..."" leading to repeated situations where the white — or in Drake’s case, Canadian — contestants realize they have no idea how to play the ""black"" version of the game. 
 
 So when SNL’s latest rendition of the sketch introduced Hanks as a white contestant named Doug — wearing one of Trump’s ""Make America Great Again"" hats and a T-shirt emblazoned with a bald eagle — it seemed like this odd man out was in for another huge loss. 
 
 But then middle-aged white guy Doug kinda crushed Black Jeopardy. 
 
 When faced with the answer, ""They Out Here Saying: The new iPhone wants your thumbprint ‘for your protection,’"" Doug immediately buzzed in with, ""What is, ‘I don’t think so, that’s how they get ya’?"" 
 
 ""Yes,"" host Darnell Haynes (Kenan Thompson) said, incredulous, as Doug’s fellow contestants (played by Sasheer Zamata and Leslie Jones) looked over in delighted shock. 
 
 From there, Doug continued to ace the game. After sharing his distrust of the iPhone’s thumbprint key, he also earned brownie points by insisting that Tyler Perry’s Madea movies are worth every penny because they let him ""laugh and pray in 90 minutes."" 
 
 Everything about his appearance suggested he wouldn’t or couldn’t get along with anyone else on Black Jeopardy. But as written by Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Che and SNL co-head writer Bryan Tucker, Doug turned out to be far more chill with the black contestants’ viewpoints than anyone might have expected, because it turned out they were his opinions too. 
 
 By the time the show jumped into a category called ""Skinny Women Can Do This for You,"" Doug received actual cheers when he scoffed, ""What is, 'Not a damn thing'?"" 
 
 However, despite having so much in common with the other people sharing the Black Jeopardy stage, Doug still didn’t totally trust them. 
 
 Throughout the game, he still showed signs of inherent bias, like when he skittered away from Darnell’s attempt to shake his hand as if the host were about to beat him up, and then balked when the final category — ""Lives That Matter"" — came up. 
 
 As a result, it’s been interesting to see how some have interpreted the sketch. RawStory described it as Hanks going ""full deplorable,"" while Slate tweeted it like so: 
 
 Watch Tom Hanks mock Trump supporters in SNL’s Black Jeopardy: https://t.co/GntrKxm66r pic.twitter.com/wXRF0XguSR — Slate (@Slate) October 24, 2016 
 
 But saying that this Black Jeopardy sketch was only trying to mock Trump supporters is an incredible simplification of a brilliant comedic approach. 
 
 Aside from Hanks playing Doug’s grumbling shrugs to perfection, the sketch was smart and sly in the way it managed to find the center of a Venn diagram between people that few — from Dougs to Darnells and everyone in between — rarely try to find anymore. 
 
 In under seven minutes, SNL dug into the commonalities between people who view each other as total opposites, the racially motivated anxieties of Trump’s base, and many Americans’ hesitance to cross increasingly polarized political lines in search of anything they might like on the other side. 
 
 Finding the absurdity in the Trump versus Clinton debates is easy. Portraying the many subtleties of the American electorate in a sharp, hilarious, and different way this far into the campaign cycle is hard — and like Doug on Black Jeopardy, SNL crushed it. 
 
 Updated to credit Michael Che and Bryan Tucker as the writers of this sketch. ||||| Just before midnight Saturday, Tom Hanks put on a denim shirt, a goatee and a red “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” hat, and in six minutes pulled off the best political sketch of the year — and it didn’t even feature Kate McKinnon or Alec Baldwin as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. 
 
 “Saturday Night Live” has staged its “Black Jeopardy” sketch a few times before, pitting its African American cast members against white guest hosts who can’t overcome their own whiteness to answer clues about black culture and jargon. This time, though, the white contestant — a Trump supporter named Doug played by Hanks — proved to be surprisingly adept at “Black Jeopardy.” 
 
 After Leslie Jones picked a category titled “They Out Here Saying,” Kenan Thompson read the clue: “They out here saying that every vote counts.” Hanks buzzed in and answered in a tight-jawed drawl: “What is ‘Come on, they already decided who wins even ’fore it happens.’ ” 
 
 “Yes!” Thompson cried, as the studio audience cheered and the black contestants nodded in approval. “Man, the Illuminati figured that out months ago!” 
 
 Historically, the sketch has embellished black stereotypes and mocked white people’s political correctness. This time around, it found common ground between African Americans and rural white conservatives: a sense of disenfranchisement, a distrust of authorities and, more playfully, an appreciation of curvy women. 
 
 Under the category “Big Girls,” Thompson read this clue: “Skinny women can do this for you.” 
 
 “What is ‘Not a damn thing,’ ” Hanks answered, again to wild cheers from the audience and a high-five from Leslie Jones. “My wife, she’s a sturdy gal.” 
 
 “That is my man right there,” Jones said.

 The sketch — written by “Weekend Update” co-anchor Michael Che and SNL co-head writer Bryan Tucker — was smart, funny and topical (a rare trifecta on SNL) and slyly illustrated that America’s problems are just as much about class as about race. In a campaign year that’s hinged on racial discord, partisan rancor and a deep suspicion of anyone who is “other,” the sketch was deliciously cathartic.

 SNL sketches rarely stick their landings — they either end too abruptly or go on forever — but the punchline of “Black Jeopardy” raised it from clever observation to sharp commentary. The “Final Jeopardy” category was “Lives That Matter.” Jones and fellow contestant Sasheer Zamata looked balefully at Hanks, who froze as the audience laughed. 
 
 “Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug,” Thompson said.

NBC ""Saturday Night Live"" is in a shaky time right now, with veteran cast members having left, but it righted the ship for its best sketch in recent memory on Saturday night. 
 
 If you missed the relatively short ""Black Jeopardy!"" sketch, which didn't get as much attention as the presidential debate satire, take seven minutes to change that. Hilarious, sharp, and topical, it's the best comedic take on the current presidential election we've seen on TV this year. 
 
 ""Black Jeopardy!"" has showed up on ""SNL"" before, usually playing up the cultural differences of contestants in a battle of stereotypes. That's true here, but in a Donald Trump-inspired way: Tom Hanks is the sole white contestant on the game show, wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. 
 
 But it turns out as the sketch goes on that the black contestants and host and the white Trump supporter have a lot in common: a distrust of authority and elections, a love of curvy women and Tyler Perry films, and an ability to get a good deal from their local ""guy."" 
 
 The delirious, cleverly written sketch insists that we're more alike than different as Americans. Until, that is, the biting final moment, when the final category shows up: ""Lives That Matter."" The black contestants look at Hanks' Trump voter awkwardly, and he stares silently. 
 
 ""It was good while it lasted,"" Kenan Thompson's host says. 
 
 The sketch, written by ""Weekend Update"" co-anchor Michael Che and ""SNL"" co-head writer Bryan Tucker, leaves us to imagine what Hanks' character thinks about which lives matter, but it's a pointed jab at how class and race play important — and sometimes very different — roles in shaping attitudes and beliefs around the current presidential election, in which Trump has amassed support among working-class whites. 
 
 Interestingly, the sketch also has fans broadly among political thinkers and writers. Fox News contributor Stacey Dash approves: 
 
 As does a former Jeb Bush campaign staffer: 
 
 Slate political writer Jamelle Bouie had some thoughts about the sketch's meaning: 
 
 And the Washington Post summed it up by calling it ""SNL's best political sketch this year.""

A black host, two black contestants, a white guy named Doug wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat, get together for an episode of Black Jeopardy. But as Doug (Tom Hanks) answers various clues, the contestants (Sasheer Zamata and Leslie Jones) learn he isn't so different from them: He, too, has suspicions about the iPhone's thumbprint key and elections, as well as a love of curvy women, Tyler Perry, and lottery tickets. All goes well until the final category: ""Lives That Matter."" ""It was good while it lasted,"" the host (Kenan Thompson) declares. What people are saying: Paul Schrodt at Business Insider credits Michael Che and Bryan Tucker for writing the show's ""best sketch in recent memory"" and ""the best comedic take on the current presidential election we've seen on TV this year."" Dan Zak at the Washington Post calls it the ""best political sketch of the year.""

 Mr. Berry said the Obama administration would push for legislation to allow a three-month delay in the $5.5 billion payment. But he stopped short of endorsing a far-reaching proposal, backed by the postal service, to allow the agency to claw back more than $50 billion that two independent actuaries have said the post office has overpaid into a major federal pension plan. Postal Service officials say such a move would go far to alleviate the agency’s financial problems. 
 
 Mr. Berry said the administration was studying the proposal, but not endorsing or opposing it at this point. 
 
 He said the administration would release a more comprehensive proposal in coming weeks “to ensure a sustainable future for the postal service,” one that would be part of the broader $1.5 trillion deficit reduction package that the President Obama has promised to send to Congress. 
 
 The post office’s financial problems are complex. Mail volume has been steadily declining, and the agency has been unable to cut its labor costs or reduce services quickly enough to match the fall in revenue. At the same time, the post office faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into new lines of business, and it is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation.

 Mr. Berry noted that the Obama administration did support the postal service’s push to recover $7 billion that officials agree was overpaid into yet another pension fund. But he expressed serious reservations about the postal service’s plan to cut costs by moving postal workers into a new, supposedly cheaper health insurance plan. 
 
 The two senators most active on postal issues — Thomas Carper , a Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee overseeing the post office, and Susan Collins of Maine , who is the ranking Republican on the governmental affairs committee — criticized the Obama administration for not acting more quickly and decisively to address the post office’s problems.

 “The proposals put forward by the administration to date have been insufficient,” Mr. Carper said.

 Ms. Collins added, “I just don’t understand why the administration doesn’t have a plan to put before us today, given the dire straits that we’re in.” 
 
 Several senators from rural states attacked the postal service’s proposals to close many post offices and to end Saturday delivery, saying it would hurt rural Americans disproportionately and would hurt those who rely on mail delivery of prescriptions and newspapers. 
 
 Postal officials say a major reason for the postal service’s financial crisis — it has lost $20 billion over the last four years — is a 2006 law requiring the post office to pay an average of $5.5 billion a year for 10 years to underwrite 75 years of health coverage for future retirees. The post office hopes to use much of $50 billion in claimed pension overpayments to cover those annual health care payments. 
 
 Cliff Guffey, president of the American Postal Workers Union, one of the four postal unions, denounced the post office’s proposal to lay off 120,000 workers. The agency has asked Congress to pass a special law overturning no-layoff provisions in its union contracts. Some of those contracts bar the layoff of any workers with more than six years on the job. 
 
 “These proposals are outrageous, illegal and despicable,” Mr. Guffey said. 
 
 He said his union had agreed to $3.7 billion in savings in a contract signed in May to help the postal service cut costs. In return, the union preserved its longstanding job-protection provisions. “To unilaterally abrogate what we gained is totally contrary to the duty to bargain collectively,” he said. 
 
 An overarching trend that has fueled the Postal Service’s crisis — and reduced annual mail volume by 22 percent since 2006 — is that Americans are e-mailing, paying bills electronically and reading shopping catalogs and news online. 
 
 Noting that some great books have been written based on letters sent by the Founding Fathers and by soldiers, Senator Claire McCaskill , Democrat of Missouri , urged the postmaster general to run an advertising campaign urging Americans to send more letters to each other. 
 
 “There is something special about receiving a piece of first-class mail, knowing that it comes from someone you care about,” she said. “I really believe that if someone would begin to market the value of sending a written letter to someone you love, you might be surprised what it will do for your Christmas season.” ||||| The Obama administration will include a financial blueprint for the nearly bankrupt U.S. Postal Service (USPS) in a deficit-reduction package that will be submitted to Congress, an administration official told lawmakers Tuesday. 
 
 With the Postal Service speeding toward default, John Berry, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, also said the administration would like to delay the deadline USPS faces for a massive benefits payment by 90 days.

 Berry said the extra time would allow the White House, Congress and Postal Service to find a path forward for the agency. 
 
 “Both the president and I know of the critical importance to our nation’s economy that the Postal Service provides,” Berry said at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. 
 
 Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said at the same hearing that pushing the $5.5 billion payment for future retiree healthcare costs back to the end of the year would give USPS some financial breathing room. 
 
 But he also reiterated that the service would default on the payment regardless of the deadline — and that, with technological advancements continuing to eat into its bottom line, USPS needed to radically restructure its business model, with some help from Congress. 
 
 If changes are not made, Donahoe told reporters, “we think that around the August, September time frame next year we would be out of cash.” 
 
 The Postal Service is fast approaching its borrowing limit of $15 billion, leaving officials concerned about a first-ever USPS default. Donahoe told the Senate panel that the Postal Service’s net loss for this fiscal year could run as high as $10 billion, and projects to around $9 billion for next year. 
 
 USPS, which does not use taxpayer revenue for operations, also expects to handle 167 billion pieces of mail this year, 22 percent less than it did in 2006. Officials say the economic struggles of the last five years are at least partly to blame for that decline, but admit that the increasing ability to communicate and pay bills online is a major factor as well. 
 
 Lawmakers at Tuesday’s hearing appeared to see a USPS overhaul as a potential area for bipartisanship in the aftermath of the polarizing debt-ceiling debate. 
 
 “Are we going to fight about the Post Office, too?” Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) asked. 
 
 Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), the chairman of the Homeland Security panel, said during the hearing that lawmakers would not be able to act as quickly as Donahoe had wanted. The postmaster general had asked for congressional action by the end of September. 
 
 But Lieberman added that he wanted the panel to move quickly to meld separate pieces of USPS legislation from Sen.

 Donahoe told reporters that, at a bare minimum, he would like for Congress to give USPS the authority to scrap Saturday delivery and give the service access to what it says is a nearly $7 billion overpayment into a federal retirement program. 
 
 The postmaster general also wants lawmakers to allow the service to either look into overseeing its own healthcare benefits or give it access to what USPS says is an even larger overpayment. 
 
 USPS has indicated that it wants the authority to lay off tens of thousands of workers over the next three years, despite labor contracts that contain no layoff provisions, and announced that it is looking into closing thousands of local branches. 
 
 Unions and Democratic lawmakers like Reps. Elijah Cummings (Md.) and Stephen Lynch (Mass.) are pushing back against the labor proposal, with contracts covering roughly 45 percent of the service’s 560,000 career employees expiring in November. 
 
 Rural-state lawmakers have expressed concern about allowing USPS to move to five-day delivery and to shutter offices. 
 
 Still, senators at Tuesday’s hearing at least appeared open to giving USPS a broad makeover. Sen. Tom Coburn Thomas (Tom) Allen CoburnPension insolvency crisis only grows as Congress sits on its hands Paul Ryan should realize that federal earmarks are the currency of cronyism Republicans in Congress shouldn't try to bring back earmarks MORE (R-Okla.) urged his colleagues to ignore what he called rosy projections about how much mail the service will deliver in the coming years. 
 
 Collins also prodded Berry for answers about why the administration is waiting to offer its USPS plan, given the service’s financial straits. The White House is expected to deliver its deficit-reduction plan, which could exceed the $1.5 trillion mandate given to the new congressional supercommittee, in the coming weeks. 
 
 On Tuesday, Berry said the administration agreed that USPS deserved access to the $6.9 billion surplus it paid into the Federal Employees Retirement System. But he also drew Collins’s ire after noting that the White House did not have a formal opinion on other potential fixes. 
 
 “I just don’t understand why the administration doesn’t have a concrete plan to put before us today, given the dire straits that we’re in,” the Maine Republican said. 
 
 Donahoe, meanwhile, appeared satisfied with the progress Congress was making, even though it seems unlikely lawmakers will work through four separate proposed overhauls of the service by the end of September. 
 
 “We appreciate all the attention, and want to work together with both parties to get this rolling,” he said.","– President Obama intends to swoop to the rescue of the ailing US Postal Service—or at least try, reports the New York Times. The White House yesterday announced that it would push for legislation giving the USPS a three-month reprieve on the $5.5 billion it’s supposed to pay on Sept. 30 for future retiree health benefits, saving it at least temporarily from a humiliating default. Even that won’t save the service for long, however—the postmaster general recently testified that, even with the reprieve, they’d run out of money by next July or August. So Obama will also unveil a longer-term plan to save the post office as part of his deficit reduction plan, the Hill reports. He has not yet, however, supported the service’s call to be refunded $50 billion it says it has overpaid into a federal pension plan.

194,"TEMPLE CITY, California (Reuters) - A Japanese American man thought to be the reclusive multi-millionaire father of Bitcoin emerged from a modest Southern California home and denied involvement with the digital currency before leading reporters on a freeway car chase to the local headquarters of the Associated Press. 
 
 Satoshi Nakamoto is surrounded by reporters as he leaves his home in Temple City, California, March 6, 2014. REUTERS/David McNew 
 
 Satoshi Nakamoto, a name known to legions of bitcoin traders, practitioners and boosters around the world, appeared to lose his anonymity on Thursday after Newsweek published a story that said he lived in Temple City, California, just east of Los Angeles. 
 
 Newsweek included a photograph and described a short interview, in which Nakamoto said he was no longer associated with Bitcoin and that it had been turned over to other people. The magazine concluded that the man was the same Nakamoto who founded Bitcoin. 
 
 Dozens of reporters, including a sprinkling of Japanese media, encircled and camped outside the man’s two-story house on Thursday morning, accosting the mailman and repeatedly ringing the doorbell, to no avail. Police cruisers drove by several times but did not stop. 
 
 Several times, someone pulled back the drapes on an upstairs window. 
 
 In the afternoon, the silver-haired, bespectacled Nakamoto stepped outside, dressed in a gray sport coat and green striped shirt, with a pen tucked in his shirt pocket. He was mobbed by reporters and told them he was looking for someone who understood Japanese to buy him a free lunch. 
 
 Newsweek estimates his wealth at $400 million. 
 
 “I’m not involved in Bitcoin. Wait a minute, I want my free lunch first. I’m going with this guy,” Nakamoto said, pointing at a reporter from AP. “I’m not in Bitcoin, I don’t know anything about it,” he said again while walking down the street with several cameras at his heels. 
 
 He and the AP reporter made their way to a nearby sushi restaurant with media in tow, before leaving and heading downtown. Los Angeles Times reporter Joe Bel Bruno followed the pair and described the chase in a running stream of tweets. Eventually, the pair dashed into the Associated Press offices in downtown Los Angeles. 
 
 MISUNDERSTOOD 
 
 In a later AP interview, Nakamoto said he was misunderstood in a key portion of the Newsweek story, where he tells the reporter on his doorstep, “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it.” 
 
 Related Coverage Bitcoin true believers unfazed by losses in Mt. Gox collapse 
 
 Asked by the AP if he had said that, Nakamoto said, “No.” 
 
 “I’m saying I’m no longer in engineering. That’s it,” he told the AP. “And even if I was, when we get hired, you have to sign this document, contract saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that’s what I implied.” 
 
 “It sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I’m not involved now. That’s not what I meant. I want to clarify that,” the AP reported him as saying. 
 
 The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, said “... We have seen zero conclusive evidence that the identified person is the designer of Bitcoin.” 
 
 “Those closest to the Bitcoin project, the informal team of core developers, have always been unaware of Nakamoto’s true identity, as Nakamoto communicated purely through electronic means,” it said in a post on its website. 
 
 Newsweek writer Leah McGrath Goodman told the AP that she stood by her story. “I stand completely by my exchange with Mr. Nakamoto. There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation - and his acknowledgment of his involvement in Bitcoin.” 
 
 “FOCUSED AND ECLECTIC” 
 
 Fans see Bitcoin as a digital-world currency beyond government interference, while critics, whose ranks swelled with the recent bankruptcy filing by major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, see a risky investment whose anonymity aids drug dealers and other criminals. 
 
 Nakamoto kept a low profile in part to avoid the attention of authorities, Newsweek said. On Thursday, the office of Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York’s Department of Financial Services, was keen on speaking with him, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. 
 
 Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion. 
 
 In the Newsweek article, Nakamoto was credited by Bitcoin’s chief scientist, Gavin Andresen, in working out the first codes behind the currency.

 A man of few words who refused to discuss anything beyond the currency or even communicate outside of email, Nakamoto was described by his brother in the Newsweek article as “fickle and has very weird hobbies,” including a penchant for model trains. 
 
 Japanese-born Nakamoto displayed an unusual aptitude for math as a child. He immigrated with his mother to California in 1959. He worked for defense and electronics company Hughes Aircraft, but never discussed work because much of it was classified, according to Newsweek interviews with several friends and relatives. 
 
 “He’s very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking. Smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. You name it, he can do it,” Newsweek quoted Arthur Nakamoto, his younger brother, as saying. ||||| The day started with a possible answer to one of the digital era's greatest mysteries: Who created the bitcoin virtual currency that has become a multibillion-dollar global phenomenon? 
 
 From there, with the unlikely revelation by Newsweek magazine that it might be Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old Japanese American living in Temple City, the day only got wilder and weirder. 
 
 It featured a media frenzy on his front lawn and a semi-comical car chase through multiple cities as Nakamoto rode in a Prius driven by an Associated Press reporter trying to elude other reporters. And then, a denial from Nakamoto — as he climbed into an elevator at the downtown AP offices — that he was the creator of bitcoin. 
 
 ""I never was involved,"" he said to a Times reporter, saying there was only one reason he had agreed to even talk to a reporter. ""It was all for a free lunch."" 
 
 Really? 
 
 Like so many other elements of the day, the off-the-cuff remarks hinted at some finality but in truth only contributed to the murkiness surrounding the true identity of ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" the mastermind behind bitcoin. Indeed, the story published by Newsweek on Thursday sparked an angry backlash among members of the bitcoin community, with some vowing retribution against the reporter and others insisting that she had the wrong man. 
 
 ""He always used non-tracking emails and did everything he could to stay anonymous, so it's difficult for me to understand why he would use his real name,"" said Adam Draper, who runs a start-up that invests in bitcoin-related companies. 
 
 In a 2008 memo titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"" ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" laid out the details for a new virtual currency. Rather than relying on banks and other financial middlemen, bitcoins would rely on a cryptographic protocol to ensure its value, security and anonymity. 
 
 Users would have to ""mine"" coins by solving complex mathematical problems. They could then buy and sell them through various exchanges. Initially, it was embraced by hackers and anarchists who loved the idea of a currency free from government or corporate control. 
 
 But over time, bitcoins created a frenzy as their value skyrocketed, making many of the original bitcoin members quite wealthy. 
 
 They also moved closer to mainstream acceptance as a growing number of businesses began accepting them and entrepreneurs and venture capitalists created an expanding economy of bitcoin-related companies. 
 
 Bitcoins have also generated controversy, with U.S. agencies breaking up a notorious online black market in which users used the currency to buy drugs and guns. Last month, one of the largest and oldest bitcoin exchanges announced that hackers had stolen more than $450 million worth of bitcoins, forcing it to file for bankruptcy. 
 
 Along the way, Nakamoto never stepped forward to claim credit. And, in fact, a couple years ago, he withdrew from the bitcoin community completely, leaving others to carry on the work of developing the system and wonder about his real identity, which remained shrouded in mystery. 
 
 Until Thursday. 
 
 Following a trail of clues over several months, Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath Goodman believed she had tracked down the real bitcoin creator. The article said Satoshi Nakamoto was not a fake name, as many had assumed, but his real one — just one of many strange twists. 
 
 In part, she said she found him by discovering he had a hobby of collecting model trains, 
 
 Fred Hill, the owner of Original Whistle-Stop Trains in Pasadena, said in an interview with The Times on Thursday that Nakamoto has been a regular since Hill bought the business in 1976. 
 
 Nakamoto, a skilled machinist who builds all of his train layouts from scratch, is highly sociable and ""a lot of fun,"" Hill said. Nakamoto will chat extensively about trains, particularly steam engines. In the shop, he always goes by his adopted first name, Dorian. 
 
 ""He's not a disheveled, spacey individual at all,"" Hill said. ""He's not an eccentric. He's a very intelligent man."" 
 
 The Newsweek story also said he had a career in technology that included some classified work for major corporations and U.S. defense agencies. He has been separated from his wife for more than a decade. And much of what he did for a living over the past decade was unclear. Nakamoto's modest home surprised the reporter because the real bitcoin creator owns about $400 million in bitcoins.","– The man ""unmasked"" as the founder of bitcoin by Newsweek says he'd never even heard of the virtual currency until reporters tracked his son down a couple of weeks ago. In an exclusive interview with the AP, Dorian Nakamoto—also known as Satoshi Nakamoto—says many of the details in the Newsweek report about him are correct, but he strongly denies having anything to do with bitcoin, which he repeatedly referred to as ""Bitcom."" Newsweek's reporter stands by her story, but Nakamoto—who says he came to the US from Japan when he was 10 but his English isn't flawless—believes a key quote was misinterpreted. ""It sounded like I was involved before with bitcoin and looked like I'm not involved now. That's not what I meant.

 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who endured 15 years of house arrest for taking on the military dictatorship in Myanmar, was only the second person to receive the award, in 2012. It was named after Elie Wiesel, a fellow recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and a Holocaust survivor who was one of the museum’s founders. Mr. Wiesel was the first recipient.

 2300 S Street, NW 
 
 Washington, DC, 20008 
 
 Dear State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, 
 
 As a living memorial to the Holocaust, the Museum’s mission is to inspire citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity. Preventing genocide is at the core of our work every day. Based on inspiration that you created for millions around the world, with your long resistance to military dictatorship, and your advocacy for freedom and human rights for all the people of Myanmar, we were honored to present you with the first Elie Wiesel Award in 2012. It is with great regret that we are now rescinding that award. We did not take this decision lightly. 
 
 In recent years, the Museum has been closely monitoring the military’s campaign against the Rohingya and your response to it. In November 2013, we held a public event at the Museum to call attention to our growing concerns, titled: “Our Walls Bear Witness: The Plight of Burma’s Rohingya.” Since that time, we have undertaken numerous visits to Myanmar and Bangladesh to obtain firsthand evidence so that we can fully understand the extent of the persecution and crimes committed, as well as the motivations and actions of all the responsible parties. 
 
 In May 2015, we published “They Want Us All to Go Away,” which documented the early warning signs of genocide. Last November, we released detailed findings based on research on the ground documenting crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and what we termed “mounting evidence of genocide” committed by the Myanmar military against Rohingya civilians since October 2016. Regrettably over the last five years the situation has become progressively worse and today seems untenable for the Rohingya population. 
 
 As the military’s attacks against the Rohingya unfolded in 2016 and 2017, we had hoped that you—as someone we and many others have celebrated for your commitment to human dignity and universal human rights—would have done something to condemn and stop the military’s brutal campaign and to express solidarity with the targeted Rohingya population. 
 
 The National League for Democracy, under your leadership, has instead refused to cooperate with United Nations investigators, promulgated hateful rhetoric against the Rohingya community, and denied access to and cracked down on journalists trying to uncover the scope of the crimes in Rakhine State. 
 
 We understand the difficult situation you must face in confronting decades of military misrule and violence in your country and that institution’s still powerful constitutional role. However, the military’s orchestration of the crimes against Rohingya and the severity of the atrocities in recent months demand that you use your moral authority to address this situation. While Myanmar has taken important first steps on the road to democracy, any transition that does not protect the country’s most vulnerable communities will be deeply flawed. 
 
 As we have said in the past, we urge you to use your unique standing and your official role as State Counsellor and Foreign Minister to cooperate with international efforts, such as the Fact-Finding Mission mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the work of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, to establish the truth about the atrocities committed in Rakhine State and secure accountability for perpetrators. 
 
 We also urge you to lead an effort to review and amend the 1982 Citizenship Law, which has rendered most Rohingya stateless, so that it is aligned with international standards and allows equal access to full citizenship rights regardless of ethnicity. You can expand access for both local and international aid workers to administer life-saving assistance. Finally, we urge you to condemn the hateful, dehumanizing language directed toward the Rohingya. 
 
 As a living memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, the Museum stands in solidarity with victims of genocide and atrocity crimes and attempts to do for victims today what was not done for the Jews of Europe. As Elie Wiesel said, “Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormenter, never the tormented.” 
 
 Sincerely,

196,"“Your honor, we don’t know if the suspect is the killer, but we do know they both used Revlon Frost & Glow hair dye.” It sounds absurd, but a well-known chemistry technique could help authorities identify criminals based on their artificial hair color. Usually, hairs left behind at a crime scene are associated with DNA testing, but such a procedure requires whole, intact hairs and is often time-consuming. Because of these constraints, forensic analyses sometimes simply compare the appearance of the hair under the microscope, but these comparisons are subjective in nature and frequently inconclusive. However, new research, published online in Analytical Chemistry, might eventually provide police with a DNA-free method for objectively linking a hair to a crime. The technique uses surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to precisely measure how light from a laser bounces off a hair. Vibrations within the molecules on the hair’s surface change the energy of the reflected photons and are caught by a detector. If the sample has a dye on it (or blood, drugs, ink, explosives, etc.) the laser will reflect differently, and each dye creates a unique pattern. The technique is so precise that scientists are able to identify distinct brands of dye and determine whether the dye was temporary or permanent—even when sampling a microscopic piece of hair. Furthermore, because SERS is fast and doesn’t destroy the sample, if a chemical does link a hair to a crime scene, the sample could potentially still be analyzed for DNA at a later point. ||||| Criminals with a penchant for dyeing their hair could soon pay for their vanity. Scientists have found a way to analyze hair samples at crime scenes to rapidly determine whether it was colored and what brand of dye was used. Their report appears in the ACS journal Analytical Chemistry. 
 
 Richard P. Van Duyne and Dmitry Kurouski note that analyzing hairs for forensic investigations, despite what TV shows would have you believe, can be a labor-intensive and flawed process. Testing samples for DNA requires an intact bulb or root, which isn't always present. Plus, the procedure is time-consuming, which can cause a large backlog of cases. So investigators will often opt to use the more traditional method of visually comparing hair from a crime scene with samples from suspects using a microscope. But this technique doesn't necessarily provide conclusive results. Van Duyne and Kurouski wanted to find a more practical and accurate way to analyze hair. 
 
 The researchers turned to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with a portable Raman spectrometer. SERS can detect minute amounts of illicit drugs, explosives, gunshot residue and body fluids. With this method, the team could rapidly confirm whether hair samples, even microscopic ones, were dyed and what brand of colorant was used. This highly sensitive technique could help forensic investigators analyze hair quickly in the field, the researchers say.

197,"Google has been condemned for supporting state censorship following reports that it is working on a mobile search app that would block certain search terms and allow it to reenter the Chinese market. 
 
 The California-based internet company has engineers designing search software that would leave out content blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to a New York Times report citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. Such blacklisting would allow the company to reverse its move out of the country eight years ago due to censorship and hacking. 
 
 China censored Google's AlphaGo match against world's best Go player Read more 
 
 The Intercept news website first reported the story, saying the Chinese search app was being tailored for the Google-backed Android operating system for mobile devices. The service was said to have been shown to Chinese officials. 
 
 Google did not respond to a request for comment. The state-owned China Securities Daily, citing information from “relevant departments”, denied the report. 
 
 As well as the search app, Google is reportedly building a second app, focused on news aggregation, for the Chinese market, which would also comply with the country’s censorship laws, according to the Information tech news site. The news app would take its lead from popular algorithmically-curated apps such as Bytedance’s Toutiao – released for the western market as TopBuzz – that eschew human editors in favour of personalised, highly viral content. 
 
 There was no guarantee the project, codenamed Dragonfly, would result in Google search returning to China. Google already offers a number of apps to Chinese users, including Google Translate and Files Go, and the company has offices in Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai. But the largest of its services – search, email and the Play app store – are all unavailable. 
 
 Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin has previously cited his birth in the Soviet Union in the 1970s as explaining his opposition to enabling Chinese censorship. “It touches me more than other people having been born in a country that was totalitarian and having seen that for the first few years of my life,” he told the Guardian in 2010, as Google pulled its censorship from Chinese search after four years of cooperating with the authorities. 
 
 The Chinese human rights community said Google’s acquiescence to China’s censorship would be a “dark day for internet freedom”. 
 
 “It is impossible to see how such a move is compatible with Google’s ‘do the right thing’ motto and we are calling on the company to change course,” said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International. “For the world’s biggest search engine to adopt such extreme measures would be a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom. In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory.” 
 
 GreatFire, a China-based organisation that monitors internet censorship and provides ways around the “great firewall” for Chinese residents, said the move “could be the final nail in the Chinese internet freedom coffin” and that “the ensuing crackdown on freedom of speech will be felt around the globe”. 
 
 Speaking to the Guardian in 2016, GreatFire’s co-founder “Charlie Smith” – a pseudonym – had praised Google’s initial decision to pull out of China in 2010 over what it said were cyber-attacks aimed at its source code and the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. 
 
 “I think people are going to be very wary and attentive to how Google goes back into China. And hopefully they’re going to show us that there is a way to go back in without having to censor,” Smith said at the time. 
 
 
 
 “I would be disappointed, and I know that a lot of other people would be disappointed, if Google went back in and said ‘we’re going to censor our search results again’, because they’ve made that mistake already, and they should understand that the situation hasn’t changed.” 
 
 Agence France-Presse contributed to this report ||||| Google is reportedly planning to get back into China, a lucrative market where it has a long history of tangling with authorities. 
 
 The Intercept reported Wednesday that Google plans to launch a search app in China that would block sensitive websites and search terms to comply with Chinese government censorship. 
 
 China has hundreds of millions of internet users and a thriving online shopping market, making it impossible for US tech companies to ignore. But jumping back into China presents ethical issues for Google (GOOGL), which has long advocated a free and open internet. 
 
 Andy Tian, a tech executive who formerly led mobile strategy and partnerships for Google in China, said the Chinese tech companies that currently dominate search can't compete with Google's product. 
 
 ""There's a huge void, Google can fill that void,"" said Tian, who is now CEO of Asia Innovations. 
 
 Asked about The Intercept report, Google said in a statement that ""we don't comment on speculation about future plans.""

 Like many other US internet platforms, Google's most popular products — search, YouTube, Gmail — have been banned in China for years, blacked out by a vast government censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall. 
 
 But that wasn't always the case. 
 
 Google China 1.0 
 
 Google launched a Chinese language version of its search engine — google.cn — in 2006. It complied with Beijing's censorship laws. 
 
 ""While removing search results is inconsistent with Google's mission, providing no information (or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information) is more inconsistent with our mission,"" Google said at the time. 
 
 Related: Google to censor itself in China 
 
 While the search engine was censored, it also flagged to users when information was removed from results. That gave Chinese internet users an idea of what they were not allowed to see. 
 
 ""We reminded users in China every single day that they are looking at filtered results,"" said Tian, who worked at Google when the search engine launched. 
 
 Still, critics complained that Google was breaching its own company motto: ""Don't Be Evil."" 
 
 The company's devotion to web freedom, critics charged, was being subverted by a willingness to comply with Chinese censorship in return for access to a huge potential customer base. 
 
 Attack and retreat 
 
 Google was battling Baidu (BIDU) for market share. Three years after launch, Google had wrestled about a third of the search market away from its Chinese rival. 
 
 The dynamic changed in January 2010, when Google charged that Chinese hackers had targeted Google and more than 20 other Western companies and compromised the email accounts of Chinese dissidents living abroad. 
 
 Beijing denied that it had been involved in the attacks, but the incident sparked a political fight with Washington. 
 
 Related: Google quits censoring search in China 
 
 About three months later, Google made good on a threat to stop offering search in China. 
 
 In March 2010, it announced it had stopped running the censored Google.cn service and began routing its Chinese users to an uncensored version of Google based in Hong Kong. 
 
 Academics, university students and other researchers relied heavily on Google's search services to access information not available through Chinese search engines like Baidu. 
 
 Businesses that depended on Google applications such as Google Docs and Gmail also suffered. 
 
 Google wants back behind the Firewall 
 
 Google's parent company Alphabet changed its motto in 2015, replacing ""Don't Be Evil"" with ""Do the Right Thing."" 
 
 From a business perspective, getting back into China is the right thing for Google. It currently offers just a few services in the country — Google Translate, a file organizing program and a new AI game. 
 
 Advertising is Google's main source of revenue, and 1.4 billion potential users are hard to ignore. Facebook (FB), which competes with Google for advertising revenue, is also locked out of China. 
 
 Shares in Baidu (BIDU) dropped 8% on Wednesday after The Intercept report was published.

 Critics and human rights groups are already accusing Google of bending to China's will. 
 
 ""The reality is that they will be serving the Chinese government,"" said Lokman Tsui, former head of free expression for Google in Asia. 
 
 ""The government now tracks people, apps on phones reveal who you are, where you are. They are intrusive,"" he added. ""They collect much more data and Google can be requested to handover these data to the government."" 
 
 — Begona Blanco Munoz contributed reporting. ||||| HONG KONG — Google withdrew from China eight years ago to protest the country’s censorship and online hacking. Now, the internet giant is working on a censored search engine for China that will filter websites and search terms that are blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. 
 
 Google has teams of engineers working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project. The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added. 
 
 Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google’s return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available. 
 
 Google’s reversal in China, which was reported earlier by The Intercept, is the latest example of how American tech companies are trying to tailor their products to enter the huge Chinese market, even if it means tamping down free speech. LinkedIn censors content in China, for example. And Facebook developed software to suppress certain posts from appearing on the social network, with the aim of potentially deploying it in China, though there was no indication it was offered to Chinese authorities. ||||| The planned move represents a dramatic shift in Google’s policy on China and will mark the first time in almost a decade that the internet giant has operated its search engine in the country. 
 
 Teams of programmers and engineers at Google have created a custom Android app, different versions of which have been named “Maotai” and “Longfei.” The app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government; the finalized version could be launched in the next six to nine months, pending approval from Chinese officials. 
 
 The project – code-named Dragonfly – has been underway since spring of last year, and accelerated following a December 2017 meeting between Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai and a top Chinese government official, according to internal Google documents and people familiar with the plans. 
 
 Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest, The Intercept can reveal. 
 
 Google’s search service cannot currently be accessed by most internet users in China because it is blocked by the country’s so-called Great Firewall. The app Google is building for China will comply with the country’s strict censorship laws, restricting access to content that Xi Jinping’s Communist Party regime deems unfavorable. 
 
 The Chinese government blocks information on the internet about political opponents, free speech, sex, news, and academic studies. It bans websites about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, for instance, and references to “anticommunism” and “dissidents.” Mentions of books that negatively portray authoritarian governments, like George Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm, have been prohibited on Weibo, a Chinese social media website. The country also censors popular Western social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as American news organizations such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. 
 
 Documents seen by The Intercept, marked “Google confidential,” say that Google’s Chinese search app will automatically identify and filter websites blocked by the Great Firewall. When a person carries out a search, banned websites will be removed from the first page of results, and a disclaimer will be displayed stating that “some results may have been removed due to statutory requirements.” Examples cited in the documents of websites that will be subject to the censorship include those of British news broadcaster BBC and the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. 
 
 The search app will “blacklist sensitive queries.” 
 
 The search app will also “blacklist sensitive queries” so that “no results will be shown” at all when people enter certain words or phrases, the documents state. The censorship will apply across the platform: Google’s image search, automatic spell check and suggested search features will incorporate the blacklists, meaning that they will not recommend people information or photographs the government has banned. 
 
 Within Google, knowledge about Dragonfly has been restricted to just a few hundred members of the internet giant’s 88,000-strong workforce, said a source with knowledge of the project. The source spoke to The Intercept on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to contact the media. The source said that they had moral and ethical concerns about Google’s role in the censorship, which is being planned by a handful of top executives and managers at the company with no public scrutiny. 
 
 “I’m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people, and feel like transparency around what’s being done is in the public interest,” the source said, adding that they feared “what is done in China will become a template for many other nations.” 
 
 Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher with human rights group Amnesty International, told The Intercept that Google’s decision to comply with the censorship would be “a big disaster for the information age.” 
 
 “This has very serious implications not just for China, but for all of us, for freedom of information and internet freedom,” said Poon. “It will set a terrible precedent for many other companies who are still trying to do business in China while maintaining the principles of not succumbing to China’s censorship. The biggest search engine in the world obeying the censorship in China is a victory for the Chinese government – it sends a signal that nobody will bother to challenge the censorship any more.” 
 
 “I’m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people.” 
 
 It is unclear whether Google will eventually launch a desktop version of its censored China search platform. For now, the company is focused on initially rolling out the Android app, which a large portion of China’s population will be able to access. Researchers estimate that more than 95 percent of people accessing the internet in China use mobile devices to go online, and Android is by far the most popular mobile operating system in the country, with 80 percent of the market share. 
 
 The documents seen by The Intercept suggest that Google will operate the search app as part of a “joint venture” with an unnamed partner company, which will presumably be based in China. However, much of the work on the Dragonfly project is being carried out at Google’s Mountain View headquarters in California, about 14 miles northwest of San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. Other teams participating in the project are based out of Google offices in New York, San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Santa Barbara, Cambridge, Washington, D.C., Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo. 
 
 Previously, between 2006 and 2010, Google had maintained a censored version of its search engine in China. At the time, the company faced severe criticism in the U.S. over its compliance with the Chinese government’s policies. 
 
 During a February 2006 congressional hearing that focused on the activities of American technology companies in China, members of the House International Relations Committee called Google a “functionary of the Chinese government” and accused it of “abhorrent actions” for participating in censorship. “Google has seriously compromised its ‘don’t be evil’ policy,” declared Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. “Indeed, it has become evil’s accomplice.” 
 
 The controversy eventually became too much for Google. In March 2010, it announced that it was pulling its search service out of China. In a blog post published at the time, the company cited Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites, and hack Google computer systems as reasons why it “could no longer continue censoring our results.” 
 
 Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, was born in the Soviet Union and seemed particularly sensitive to concerns around censorship, having had personal experience under a repressive regime. After Google ceased its search service in 2010, Brin said that the company’s objection related to “forces of totalitarianism,” and added that he hoped the decision to pull the search platform out of the country would help lead to a “more open internet.” 
 
 “Companies operating in China must be prepared to turn over user data to security agencies.” 
 
 Since then, however, censorship and surveillance in China has become more pervasive. In 2016, the country’s government passed a new cybersecurity law, which Human Rights Watch said “strengthens censorship, surveillance, and other controls over the internet.” The government is using new automated systems to monitor and censor the internet, and it has cracked down on privacy technologies that Chinese people were using to circumvent the restrictions. 
 
 “It has been a requirement that companies operating in China must be prepared to police their users and turn over user data to security agencies upon request,” said Ron Deibert, director of Citizen Lab, an internet research group based at the University of Toronto. “We have also found overall that internet censorship [in China] is evolving towards less transparency, with less notification to users when messages are censored or removed across all platforms.” 
 
 Despite the continued repression, opinions have changed at the highest levels of Google. China now has more than 750 million internet users, equivalent to the entire population of Europe. It therefore represents a potentially massive revenue stream for the internet giant, which is likely a factor in its decision to relaunch the search platform in the country. ||||| Google is developing a news-aggregation app for use in China that will comply with the country’s strict censorship laws, part of a plan to re-enter the world’s largest internet market in the near future, according to three people familiar with the project. 
 
 Google has been working on the app since last year and had been meeting with Chinese regulators to discuss the project, the people said. It is also preparing a mobile app for internet search in China that will comply with local censorship laws, an effort first reported Wednesday by The Intercept. The projects are part of an initiative code-named Dragonfly that marks a reversal for Google, which shut down its search engine in China eight years ago in dramatic fashion due to a growing crackdown on internet content by government authorities.","– Google is looking to reenter the Chinese market it exited in protest over government censorship in a move critics say is nothing short of hypocritical.

It's a savvy business move in a lucrative market of over 750 million users, dominated by search engine Baidu. Yet it recalls Google's 2010 exit from China over the same government censorship its latest efforts would reportedly support.

198,"Michael Chamberlain, the father of Azaria, who was snatched by a dingo at Uluru in 1980, has died aged 72. 
 
 More than 30 years after being thrust into Australian folklore as a central figure in one of the country’s most notorious murder trials, Chamberlain still railed against the “gross injustice” that shaped his life. 
 
 He died of acute leukaemia in Gosford hospital on the New South Wales central coast on Monday. 
 
 Michael, a pastor in the Seventh-Day Adventist church, and his wife Lindy were put under the spotlight when their nine-week-old daughter Azaria was snatched from a tent during a family holiday at Uluru in August, 1980. 
 
 They were ultimately convicted, Lindy for murder and Michael for being an accessory after the fact. The prosecution alleged that Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria’s throat in the front seat of the family car and hidden the baby’s body in a large camera case. Lawyers presented controversial forensic evidence, later discredited, to support their case. 
 
 Azaria Chamberlain: archive coverage Read more 
 
 Lindy served more than three years of a life sentence imposed in 1982 – giving birth to the couple’s fourth child Kahlia in Darwin prison. Michael was handed an 18-month suspended sentence for being an accessory. 
 
 In 1986, the chance discovery of Azaria’s matinee jacket – an item of clothing her mother had always said her baby had been wearing at the time of the attack – reopened the case. After a royal commission in 1987 the Chamberlains were pardoned and their convictions quashed, but Michael remained bitter at their treatment. 
 
 After divorcing, remarrying, earning a PhD in education, becoming a teacher and writing several books, he still lamented the case as a “gross injustice”. 
 
 “It was one of the worst perversions of justice and forensic science in Australian history,” he said in 2014. “We had gone as babes in the woods. A Catholic lawyer described us as lambs to the slaughter. 
 
 “We had lived by the credo that if you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear. It was dead wrong.”

 He also believed the time Lindy spent behind bars had damaged her. In 1990 the couple’s marriage fell apart. Michael married Ingrid Bergner in 1994, with whom he had daughter, Zahra, in 1996. 
 
 Lindy Chamberlain also remarried, becoming Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton. 
 
 The disappearance of Azaria prompted one of Australia’s longest-running legal sagas, one that captivated and polarised the nation. It was the subject of the 1988 film Evil Angels, starring Meryl Streep as Lindy. The film was released as A Cry in the Dark in territories other than Australia and New Zealand. 
 
 
 
 Despite the release of the Chamberlains from jail, a coronial inquest into Azaria in 1995 delivered an open verdict. The fourth coronial inquest into the case, held in 2012, ruled that a dingo was responsible for the baby’s death. 
 
 The was what the first inquest, back in early 1981, had also concluded, and what the Chamberlains had steadfastly said since Lindy yelled the famous words: “That dingo’s got my baby.” 
 
 After the 2012 verdict Michael Chamberlain stood on the courtroom steps in Darwin and said: “I am here to tell you that you can get justice even when you think that all is lost.”

 But he said he still had plenty of questions he wanted authorities to answer. 
 
 “I have peace and gratitude in my heart that Azaria’s spirit now lies rested, and I have gratitude and peace in my heart because justice has been done for us,” he said in 2012 on the release of his book Heart of Stone: Justice for Azaria. 
 
 “But why did this happen to us? Why did it take so long? And why were there consistently a whole lot of mistakes made? 
 
 “It was systemic; it just wasn’t one or two. It wasn’t isolated and I have to ask the question, was it by accident?” 
 
 Chamberlain made a tilt at state politics in 2003, running as a Liberal party candidate in the seat of Lake Macquarie in NSW. He didn’tachieved a 5.2% swing against incumbent MP Geoff Hunter but was not elected. 
 
 He then taught at an Aboriginal high school in Brewarrina, NSW, for three years before returning the central coast where he taught at Gosford high school until 2008, when he retired. 
 
 The University of Newcastle last year appointed him a conjoint professor at its school of education. 
 
 Chamberlain wrote three books, including Beyond Azaria: Black Light White Light, which detailed his feelings following the death of his daughter and the severe public scrutiny he and his family were placed under. 
 
 He became Ingrid’s full-time carer after she suffered a stroke in 2011.

 Michael Chamberlain, who fought for years to clear his family's name after his baby daughter Azaria was killed by a dingo, has died at the age of 72. 
 
 He died in Gosford hospital on Monday after complications from leukaemia. 
 
 The case of Mr Chamberlain and his wife, Lindy, attracted huge attention in Australia. 
 
 Prosecutors believed that the couple had killed their daughter. It was years before they were exonerated and the cause of death formally established. 
 
 At a trial in 1982, Lindy was found guilty of murdering Azaria and sentenced to life in jail. Michael was convicted as an accessory after the fact - until a chance discovery in 1986 overturned both verdicts. 
 
 Speaking in 2012, when the Northern Territory coroner finally ruled that Azaria had been taken by a dingo, Mr Chamberlain said that the battle to get to the legal truth had taken too long. 
 
 ""However, I am here to tell you that you can get justice even when you think that all is lost,"" he said. 
 
 Actor Sam Neill, who portrayed Michael in the film A Cry in the Dark, said: ""Throughout their cruel ordeal and the years of injustice, Michael Chamberlain maintained that quiet unassuming dignity - an impressive man. Rest in peace."" 
 
 What happened to Azaria Chamberlain? 
 
 On 17 August 1980, the Chamberlain family were on a camping trip to Uluru, then called Ayer's Rock, when baby Azaria was taken from their tent by a dingo. 
 
 Lindy reportedly cried out: ""my God, my God, the dingo's got my baby!"" but a frantic search by the camping group and local guides discovered nothing. Azaria's body was never found. 
 
 Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Azaria Chamberlain was only nine weeks old when she disappeared 
 
 In the aftermath, an inquest accepted Lindy and Michael's version of events, but law enforcement officials decided they did not. 
 
 At the time, dingoes were not generally seen as dangerous, and the Chamberlains' story was not widely believed. 
 
 A second inquest a year later led to allegations that the baby's throat had been cut and her body disposed of later. Chemical evidence of infant blood in the family car - which would later be widely discredited - was a key part of the prosecution. 
 
 Lindy was charged with murder and sentenced to life in prison. 
 
 Michael was charged with being an accessory after the fact and received an 18-month suspended sentence. 
 
 How did Lindy and Michael prove their innocence? 
 
 Lindy said her baby had been wearing a jacket, but there was no evidence of one among the baby's other clothes, found near the campsite. 
 
 She was still in prison in early 1986, having exhausted her legal options all the way to a High Court appeal, when a chance discovery revealed new evidence to support her story. 
 
 David Brett, an English backpacker, fell to his death while attempting to climb Uluru. The team searching for Mr Brett found a baby's jacket - matching exactly the brand and description Lindy gave in her testimony - in an area littered with dingo dens.

 The revelation prompted authorities to order a fresh investigation and to release Lindy from prison. 
 
 It would be another two years before the pair were fully cleared, following a royal commission investigation. 
 
 Why did the case capture the world's imagination? 
 
 Lindy and Michael's story split the nation, and the court case was covered in sensational fashion by the media. 
 
 Their religion, as Seventh Day Adventists, was not widely understood, leading to suspicion and even accusations of cult-like activity. It was one of the biggest legal and media events of the 1980s. 
 
 After the miscarriage of justice emerged, the case became a prime example of media influence in court cases.

 Outside Australia, the story would find worldwide fame when turned into a film, A Cry in the Dark, starring Meryl Streep as Lindy and Sam Neill as Michael. 
 
 A 32-year battle 
 
 Despite Lindy's release, the official cause of death remained the subject of debate for decades. Many people in Australia still believed there was more to the case. 
 
 Lindy and Michael divorced a few years after they were exonerated in the late 1980s, and Lindy began a campaign to have dingoes acknowledged as dangerous to humans. 
 
 Media caption Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton: ''We are relieved and delighted'' 
 
 In 2012, 32 years after Azaria's death, a coroner issued the final report in the case, formally stating that Azaria was attacked and taken by a dingo, as her parents had always maintained. 
 
 Speaking after the verdict, Michael Chamberlain said ""the truth is out"" - and it was time for ""some healing and a chance to put our daughter's spirit to rest"". ||||| FILE - This October 1990, file photo shows Michael Chamberlain, right, and then his wife Lindy when Lindy launched her book on the disappearance of her baby daughter Azaria in 1980.

 SYDNEY (AP) — Michael Chamberlain, who waged a decades-long battle to prove his baby daughter was killed by a dingo in Australia's most notorious case of injustice, has died, his former wife said Tuesday. He was 72. 
 
 Chamberlain died suddenly, his ex-wife, Lindy Chamberlain, said in a statement. Michael Chamberlain's longtime friend and former lawyer, Stuart Tipple, told Australia's Fairfax Media that Michael died on Monday night as a result of complications from leukemia. 
 
 ""I am on my way today to support and be with our children,"" Lindy said in a statement. ""Given Michael's death was unexpected, I would ask that the media please consider that Michael's wife and all of his children are deeply grieving and need some space."" 
 
 Lindy and Michael were wrongly convicted in the death of their 9-week-old daughter Azaria after the infant vanished from their tent during a 1980 camping trip to Uluru, the sacred monolith in Australia's Outback. 
 
 The mystery surrounding Azaria's disappearance was the most divisive and sensational legal drama in Australian history. It gained a place in global pop culture after Meryl Streep portrayed Lindy in the movie ""A Cry in the Dark."" 
 
 The Chamberlains insisted that a dingo snatched their daughter from the tent. But officials doubted the wild dogs were capable of carrying an infant. Instead, prosecutors argued that Lindy had slit her daughter's throat and buried her in the desert. 
 
 There were no witnesses, no motive and no body; Azaria's remains were never found. But in 1982, Lindy was nonetheless convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Michael was convicted of being an accessory after the fact and given a suspended sentence. 
 
 Three years later, Azaria's jacket was found in the desert near a dingo den and Lindy was quickly released from prison. A Royal Commission, the highest form of investigation in Australia, later debunked much of the forensic evidence used at trial and the Chamberlains' convictions were overturned. In 2012 — more than three decades after Azaria vanished — a coroner finally ruled that the infant had died as a result of a dingo attack. 
 
 The trial remains a source of shame for the many Australians who initially doubted the Chamberlains and cast Lindy as a villain largely due to her religious beliefs. Michael Chamberlain was a pastor with the Seventh-day Adventist church, a Protestant denomination that few Australians understood. Rumors flew that Lindy had killed her daughter as part of a grisly religious ritual. 
 
 Shortly before the coroner's ruling in 2012, Michael Chamberlain told The Associated Press that religious bigotry played a large role in the injustice he and his former wife suffered. 
 
 ""The church got so smashed up, erroneously, and all through, really, a nasty dose of prejudice,"" Chamberlain told The AP. ""I can say that I think our religion definitely impacted quite strongly on the attitude that many Australians developed."" 
 
 Michael and Lindy divorced in 1991. He later married Ingrid Bergner, and went on to become an author and teacher. 
 
 Actor Sam Neill, who portrayed Michael in ""A Cry in the Dark,"" said on Monday that the Chamberlains had been ""terribly, cruelly wronged."" 
 
 ""Throughout their cruel ordeal & the years of injustice, (Michael) Chamberlain maintained that quiet unassuming dignity — an impressive man,"" Neill tweeted. ""RIP.""

 The Christian Post is reporting that members of the right-wing Christian group, known for its strong anti-gay stance, are planning to stage a protest at the pop diva's private memorial, set for this weekend in her hometown of Newark, N.J. The group has even released a parody of Houston's signature song, titled ""God Will Always Hate You, Whitney"" (sung to the tune of ""I Will Always Love You""). 
 
 Houston died Feb. 11 at the age of 48. 
 
 Westboro leader Margie J. Phelps appears to have confirmed the reports on her Twitter account: 
 
 @MargieJPhelps 
 
 MargiePhelps Yay! 2 pickets in NJ-Whitney Houston funeral & legis. MY : NJ gay marriage bill passes in state Senate, 24-16. Story coming shortly. 
 
 It is unclear why Westboro would have such an issue with Houston, who was known as a devout Christian and began her singing career at Newark's New Hope Baptist Church, where the funeral will be held. Phelps did imply that Houston's gay fanbase may have played a factor, tweeting: ""F--k call her 'gay icon.' Yeah, WBC is picketing that funeral."" 
 
 Phelps also noted:

 All are expected at the private funeral in Newark Saturday for Whitney. 
 
 City officials with knowledge of the family's plans told The Star-Ledger that Bill Cosby, David Bowie and Jay-Z also will attend Whitney Houston’s invitation-only funeral at the New Hope Baptist Church on Sussex Avenue, the house of worship where she was nicknamed ""Nippy,"" for a mischievous cartoon character, and where her golden voice first flourished in the junior choir. 
 
 The sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to make the guest list public. 
 
 Music legends Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin — Houston’s godmother — are scheduled to sing in at the star-studded service that begins at noon. So are Alicia Keys, R. Kelly and gospel singer Donnie McClurkin, said A. Curtis Farrow of the Newark-based Irving Street Rep company, which is helping the Houston family organize the service. 
 
 And Thursday night, the celebrity gossip website TMZ reported that the Houston family has reached out to Bobby Brown, Whitney’s ex-husband, and have formally invited him to attend the service. 
 
 Interviews with church leaders, friends of the family and others suggest the funeral will be a mixture of a Parade of Stars and religious music revelry. 
 
 ""It’s going to be a ceremony that reflects her life,"" New Hope church Pastor Joe A. Carter said yesterday as sound equipment was loaded through church doors. 
 
 Farrow, who has known members of the Houston family for about 16 years, characterized the service as ""a celebration of Whitney’s life, with the participation of many people who are very important in Whitney’s life."" 
 
 Houston’s cousin, Dionne Warwick, is scheduled to speak at the service, as are filmmaker Tyler Perry, Houston’s music-industry mentor Clive Davis and Houston’s sister-in-law and manager, Patricia Houston, Farrow said. 
 
 The church’s New Hope Mass Choir, along with the New Jersey Mass Choir, will perform the processional and the opening, Farrow said. Choir members will back McClurkin and, possibly, some other artists, and Rickey Minor will lead a house band. 
 
 The song list and who will be in the backing cast for each artist has not yet been worked out. 
 
 Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio said officers will provide motorcycle escorts to many of the celebrities expected to arrive in Newark. 
 
 The funeral will otherwise be a private affair, with police shutting down a six square-block area around the church. There will be no procession of Houston’s body from the Whigham Funeral Home on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the church, a little over a mile away, and no outside video screens so fans can mourn publicly, DeMaio said.

 Fans will have to content themselves with a TV and Internet feed from inside the church, where Pastor Marvin L. Winans is scheduled to deliver a eulogy. He told CNN’s Anderson Cooper the family wanted to bury Houston ""with dignity."" 
 
 ""We loved her when she was Nippy in New Jersey,"" said Winans, a family friend who is a Grammy Award winner and pastor of Perfecting Church in Detroit. ""The world loved her because of her voice. But if Nippy could not sing, the Houston family would love her, and I knew that Mama Houston would do it the way she wanted it done. We’re going to church and we’re not going to be worried about if the world can get in."" 
 
 Everyone had a Whitney story Thursday. 
 
 The jaw-dropping moment they first heard her sing at church. Or met her mother at a beauty supply store. 
 
 STAGING AREAS FOR FANS 
 
 But fans won’t be able to get close to the star’s funeral. 
 
 Two staging areas will be available for the public, DeMaio said. One will be on Sussex Avenue at Norfolk Street, near an NJ Transit light rail station, and the other on Nesbitt Street near James Street. 
 
 NJ Transit will have additional light rail vehicles and buses positioned to meet the expected demand tomorrow, agency spokesman John Durso Jr. said. 
 
 ""We’re taking prudent and necessary steps to meet the expected increase in ridership due to the funeral,"" he said. 
 
 Michelle Johnson, 48, of Roselle, said her cousin sang background with Houston at New Hope. Since she didn’t know if she would be able to get close tomorrow, she stood outside the church yesterday afternoon in the drizzle. 
 
 ""This is just a way to say thank you,"" Johnson said as she scanned the mini shrine fans made for the star on the church’s front fence. ""I understand they want their privacy, and they need that for now."" 
 
 Tyrone Hudson of Newark and his partner, Bobby Hudson, tied a balloon on the fence that read: ""You’re always in our hearts."" 
 
 ""I loved her music, I loved her,"" said Hudson, who at 48 was the same age as the pop queen. 
 
 
 
 Others, like 35-year-old Fuquan Snead of Newark, don’t have a Houston story, but can rattle off a list of hits from the artist who had 11 songs that topped the charts. 
 
 And barricades or not, rain or not, they say they’ll come out to pay their respects to a fellow Newarker. 
 
 ""You loved this woman’s music for many years, you have to come out and show your support,"" Snead said. 
 
 FLAGS AT HALF-STAFF 
 
 Mayor Cory Booker will attend the services, according to his spokeswoman, Anne Torres. As of Thursday, he was the only Newark dignitary to publicly receive an invitation. 
 
 The mayor also said Newark will lower flags at its municipal buildings to half-staff in honor of Houston, mirroring Gov. Chris Christie’s controversial decision to do the same at state facilities. 
 
 ""Our city is mourning the loss of one of its native daughters and one of music’s shining stars,"" Booker said in a statement. ""Whitney Houston inspired so many people, and although she went from a Newark church to the global stage, she always remained a deep part of our city’s pride and collective heart."" 
 
 Outside the funeral home yesterday, a simple condolence book sat atop a Plexiglas stand. 
 
 Through the funeral parlor’s glass doors facing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, passers-by could glimpse a large picture of Houston. The portrait of the singer is framed by a black microphone stand in one corner and a high-backed ""Diva"" chair with a fur throw in the other. A Bible atop the fur is open to the 23rd Psalm. 
 
 By yesterday morning, dozens had signed the book, and a few jotted down lengthier tributes to the singing sensation who died Saturday in her room at the Beverly Hills Hilton. 
 
 ""You are one of God’s angels and he has called you home,"" read one. 
 
 With no public services for Houston, funeral home director Carolyn Whigham wanted to give admirers a chance to note their condolences. 
 
 ""It’s put together as memorabilia,"" she said. 
 
 Whigham, who has known the Houston family for decades, said the condolence book would be given to Bobbi Christina Brown, Houston’s 18-year-old daughter. 
 
 Newark’s Sherri Dillard, 32, stopped by on the cold, overcast morning. 
 
 ""I had to be here — she’s like family,"" she said, brushing aside a tear. ""I love her dead or alive."" 
 
 A Middlesex County police officer, Dillard said she would do all she could to attend tomorrow’s services. 
 
 Maplewood’s Alex Boykins, 38, also signed the book. 
 
 ""I was brought up on her music,"" he said after taking a picture of the window display. 
 
 Boykins said that although a more formal public commemoration would be fitting, he understood the family’s decision. 
 
 ""We’ve had her for many years,"" he said. ""We have to appreciate and respect that.""

 He catapulted her to Hollywood superstardom as her big-screen bodyguard and now Kevin Costner will pay special tribute to Whitney Houston at her final curtain. 
 
 The co-star behind Houston’s romantic thriller “The Bodyguard” will address a church on Saturday packed with A-listers, including Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Alicia Keys and Tyler Perry, a source said. 
 
 The two-time Oscar winner hand-picked Houston to play his tempestuous diva and reportedly told her not to take acting lessons to preserve the natural charm he found so alluring. 
 
 WHITNEY HOUSTON: HER LIFE IN PHOTOS 
 
 “Some of my choices are real simple, and it’s very easy to fall in love with Whitney,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1992 — the year the movie and its smash single, “I Will Always Love You,” dominated pop culture. 
 
 Wonder and Franklin are scheduled to sing at the invitation-only service inside the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark. 
 
 Houston’s music mentor Clive Davis also will speak, her rep said. So will her cousin, singer Dionne Warwick, who stopped at the church Thursday to check on preparations. 
 
 The 90-minute service in the same church where Houston’s towering voice filled the rafters as a choir member will follow a private family wake Friday night. 
 
 The ultra-private viewing will give daughter Bobbi Kristina, 18, her first chance to say a final farewell without any cameras, a source told The News. 
 
 Houston’s estranged ex-husband Bobby Brown, 43, will attend Saturday’s funeral despite some friction with the dead diva’s mom, Cissy. Hours later, he’ll join his New Edition bandmates at a reunion concert at the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut. 
 
 “Bobby will be there,” the source said, knocking down reports he would be locked out. “You can imagine the family doesn’t want to be in discord with Bobbi Kristina.” 
 
 New Hope Pastor Joe Carter will conduct Saturday’s ceremony, and the eulogy will be given by the Rev. Marvin Winans, who married the former couple. 
 
 “We’re going to celebrate her life in the standard of which she deserves,” Carter said. “This is a church, and we’re gonna have some church.” 
 
 The service will be broadcast on TV and streamed live on NYDailyNews.com starting at noon. 
 
 Houston, who had the voice of an angel but a life filled with demons, died in a Beverly Hills hotel suite Saturday just hours before Davis’ annual pre-Grammy party. 
 
 A member of her entourage found her unconscious in the bathtub, her head submerged in water, police said. 
 
 Multiple prescription pill bottles were recovered in her room, but the official cause of death may not be known for weeks, pending toxicology tests, officials said. 
 
 A source close to the investigation told The News that investigators are looking at possible prescription drug interaction with an underlying ailment, possibly resulting in organ failure.

200,"A rookie prosecutor knocked one out of the park Wednesday, when his first felony case resulted in a guilty verdict and two life sentences for a habitual drunk driver. 
 
 Montgomery County Assistant District Attorney Kyle Crowl said, until the trial’s punishment phase, the jury had no idea 64-year-old Bobby Gene Martin had been arrested for Driving While Intoxicated 10 times. They only knew he was charged with DWI 3rd or More and Retaliation. 
 
 “You could see they were actually shocked that he’d had 10 DWIs and was still out and about driving around,” Crowl said. 
 
 The retaliation charge, Crowl said, was based on something many people don’t know about. 
 
 “Retaliation is when you act out and threaten harm to a public servant,” he said. “In this case, (Martin) had threatened to actually kill not only the deputy that arrested him, but also his wife, his children, his mom and several times told him he was going to beat him up.” 
 
 Crowl said Martin had done the same thing when he was arrested for DWI in Montgomery County back in 1999. He told that deputy he was going to “kill him and everything he ever loved.” 
 
 “I think that resonated with the jury that if no matter what he does, if he ever gets out of jail, he’s going to do it again,” Crowl said. 
 
 Martin’s first DWI arrest occurred in 1981, so he had been driving drunk for over 30 years. 
 
 Apparently, he has other issues as well. A Montgomery County jailer testified that Martin had threatened him and went on a racist rant. The jailer said it was something he had to learn to live with as a jailer, but Martin stood out in his mind as “one of the more intoxicated individuals, and one of the more racist individuals” he’s had to deal with. 
 
 Martin, who lived in northeast Houston at the time of his latest arrest, is 64 and will be 80 before he is eligible for parole. Crowl said the parole board will take into account that he had two life sentences, even though by law they had to run concurrently. 
 
 “Hopefully this defendant will never be driving around the streets of Montgomery County,” he said. 
 
 Crowl has only been with the DA’s office for a year and a half, and Martin was his first felony case. After securing the maximum sentence on both charges, Crowl said of his big win, “I’m hoping to keep it going.”

 1/20/1981 ||||| A Montgomery County jury sentenced Bobby Gene Martin, 64, to two life sentences Wednesday for his 10th DWI and retaliation against a police officer stemming from an Aug. 2, 2014 arrest. 
 
 Montgomery County Sheriff’s Deputy John Jordan had been dispatched to FM 1485 near Peach Creek in East Montgomery County after multiple people called 911 reporting a vehicle wrecked in a ditch and a man standing outside the vehicle. 
 
 A wrecker driver who stopped by the scene testified in the trial that Martin asked the wrecker to tow his truck and take him home because he did not want “another DWI.” When Jordan arrived, he found the truck but no driver. 
 
 After a brief search, Jordan found Martin, of Houston, hiding nearby in a drainage ditch, waist-deep in water, behind a bush. 
 
 After failing standardized field sobriety tests, the defendant was arrested and taken to jail. 
 
 During the transport, Martin made repeated threats to kill Jordan, his wife and his family. 
 
 Once at the Montgomery County Jail, he also threatened to kill Deputy Henry Langston, a jailer, and spewed racial epithets at him. 
 
 Jurors were visibly emotional as Langston recalled being called the “N” word by the defendant. 
 
 A blood test revealed Martin’s blood alcohol level was 0.217, more than 2 ½ times the legal limit. 
 
 The jury deliberated approximately one hour to find Martin guilty of both the DWI and the retaliation, both third degree felonies. 
 
 During the punishment phase, Assistant District Attorney Kyle Crowl told the jury up front he would be asking for a life sentence on both counts, stating that the DWI and retaliation Martin committed on Aug. 2, 2014 were merely “icing on a cake that (Martin) had been baking his whole life.” 
 
 Crowl then went on to present evidence of nine prior DWI convictions beginning in 1981, including a 1999 DWI in which Martin threatened to kill MCSO Sgt. Chris Rogers, who had arrested Martin. Crowl also presented evidence of three separate prison trips, two for DWI and one for Evading Arrest in a Motor Vehicle. Because of his habitual status, Martin’s punishment range was 25 to life. 
 
 “Bobby Martin has shown you who he is,” Crowl told the jury in closing arguments, “and you should sleep well tonight knowing he is off the road for the rest of his life.” 
 
 The jury deliberated exactly three hours before returning two life sentences for Martin. 
 
 “I have said many times that intoxicated drivers are one of the biggest threats to our community’s safety,” District Attorney Brett Ligon said. “My prosecutors are as dedicated as I am to preventing this crime. But for those we cannot prevent, we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. The jury today reiterated what I’ve always known—that habitual criminals have no place in Montgomery County.” ||||| Photo: Montgomery County Sheriff's Offi

 Bobby Martin was sentenced this week to life in prison for his...","– A Texas man was sentenced to two life sentences Wednesday for drunk driving. If that seems harsh, consider that Bobby Gene Martin, 64, racked up 10 DWI charges between 1981 and 2014, reports the Montgomery County Police Reporter. In the latest incident, Martin crashed his mom's pickup truck on Aug. 2, then reportedly asked a wrecker driver for a ride home so he wouldn't get ""another DWI."" The driver refused, and responding officers found Martin in water up to his waist in a nearby drainage ditch, the Courier reports. His blood alcohol level was 0.217. Martin then threatened to ""kill not only the deputy that arrested him, but also his wife, his children, his mom,"" Montgomery County Assistant District Attorney Kyle Crowl said. Once at the local jail, Martin kept up the death threats, hurling them, along with racial slurs, at the jailer, per Crowl. The jury took one hour to convict Martin and spent three hours deliberating his sentence after learning of his earlier crimes. As a habitual offender, he faced 25 years to life. After notching his eighth drunk-driving conviction in 1999, Martin was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the Houston Chronicle reports. After being released, he was jailed once again for a year after a 2009 DWI arrest. ""It is amazing he hasn't killed anyone yet,"" said Crowl, who painted this metaphor for the jury: The latest charges were the ""icing on a cake that [Martin] had been baking his whole life.""

 A medical degree came in handy for one Southland junior doctor after he was attacked by a shark while fishing. 
 
 James Grant fought off what's believed to be a sevengill shark, and stitched himself up before his mates took him to hospital. 
 
 Every fisherman has a story about ""the one that got away"", but Dr Grant his happy he did. 
 
 ""[I felt] something tugging on my leg, and I thought it might have been one of my dive buddies,"" he says. ""I turned around and I saw a big silver face looking at me and a big body trailing off behind."" 
 
 Dr Grant was with friends near Cosy Nook on the southern coast, and thinks the hungry shark was attracted by blood from a fish he had just speared. So he attacked the shark. 
 
 ""All I went to do was stab it as many times as I could really, and eventually it let go,"" he says. 
 
 Dr Grant, a junior doctor, scrambled to shore, grabbing a first-aid kit he kept for pig hunting. Then without thinking, he stitched himself up on the beach. 
 
 ""I think I must have been pretty adrenalised at the time, because I couldn't really feel it."" 
 
 His friends ventured ashore and with blood dripping down his leg, took Dr Grant to the nearby Colac Bay pub for a check-up. 
 
 ""We gave him a pint of beer and his mates were kicking around, laughing,"" says Colac Bay Tavern co-owner Warren Bevin. ""Then we brought out the big first-aid kit and got a little bandage out. There were a couple of good holes on both sides of his leg."" 
 
 Dr Grant's thick neoprene wetsuit stopped the shark's razor-sharp teeth from doing more serious damage. 
 
 His colleagues at Southland Hospital later gave his leg a proper stitch-up, ensuring he'll have a tidy scar and a good fishy tale to tell.

 NICOLE GOURLEY/Fairfax NZ BITE FRIGHT: Junior doctor James Grant inspects the wetsuit he was wearing when he was attacked by a shark on Saturday. Relevant offers 
 
 James Grant had barely caught his first fish when a shark plunged its teeth into his leg. 
 
 He had just entered the water at Garden Bay near Cosy Nook in Southland on Saturday when the next thing he knew a shark was wrapping its jaws around his leg. 
 
 And he's got the holes in his wet suit and his leg to prove it. 
 
 ""It was pretty well latched on, I was just trying to get it off."" 
 
 But Mr Grant, 24, a junior doctor, gave as good as he got - stabbing what he believed was a type of seven-gill shark, with his diving knife as he tried to get it to unlatch. 
 
 ""I sort of just fought the shark off. The shark got a few stabs. The knife wasn't long enough though,"" he said. 
 
 When Mr Grant managed to get rid of the shark he tried to get the attention of his three friends, who were spearfishing just around the bay. But his mates did not take him seriously. 
 
 ""I thought surely he hasn't been bitten, there's no way he has been bitten, he's got to be taking the p...,"" Mackley Lindsay said. 
 
 But he wasn't, instead he sat on the shore stitching his own leg. 
 
 His friends carried on fishing while Mr Grant tacked the wounds together with a needle and thread from his first-aid kit for his pig-hunting dogs. 
 
 ""I'm pretty happy I had such a thick wet suit on too,"" he said. 
 
 Friend Jim Robins downplayed the event at the time. ""He was walking so it couldn't have been that bad,"" he said. 
 
 However, his friends did do him a favour - taking him to the tavern in Colac Bay before the hospital. 
 
 The pub at Colac Bay served him a beer alongside a few bandages to stop his leg from dripping blood on the carpet. 
 
 ""It would have been great if I had killed it because there was a fishing competition on at the Colac Bay Tavern,"" Mr Grant said. He received ""a bit of banter"" from his colleagues at Southland Hospital while they stitched him up. 
 
 ""I am pretty grateful to have my leg still."" 
 
 The experience had not deterred him. ""When the stitches come out I will be back in the water."" 
 
 Department of Conservation technical officer marine and shark specialist Clinton Duffy said, although it was difficult to tell without an accurate description, he believed the attacker was probably a broadnosed seven-gill shark. 
 
 Seven-gill sharks grew up to 3 metres long, and New Zealand was one of a few countries where they attacked humans. However, attacks by the seven-gill were relatively common around the Southland and Otago coast. 
 
 SURVIVAL TIPS 
 
 How to avoid shark attacks: Treat any shark longer than 1.5 metres as dangerous, and leave the water quickly and quietly. 
 
 Avoid swimming at dawn, dusk or at night. Sharks do most of their feeding at night. 
 
 Don't swim where seagulls or dolphins are feeding, where there are shoals of fish, where people are fishing or gutting their catch, or where there are deeper tidal channels – these all could attract sharks.

""I looked behind to see who it was and got a bit of a shock,"" James Grant, a 24-year-old doctor, tells Radio New Zealand. It was, apparently, a seven-gill shark—which can grow to almost 10 feet, an expert tells Stuff.co.nz. Though he couldn't see it, he guessed its jaw spanned about 8 inches. His next thought: ""Bugger, now I have to try and get this thing off my leg."" Grant stabbed at it using a knife already in his hand, the Guardian reports. ""Put a few nicks in it,"" he says.

 Hagel says he understands that Karzai faces political pressures as the war winds down. 
 
 ""I think he understands where we are and where we've been, and hopefully where we're going together,"" Hagel told reporters, but he declined to detail their talks. 
 
 Hagel is disputing Karzai's accusations that the U.S. and the Taliban are working in concert to show that violence in the country will worsen if most coalition troops leave. 
 
 The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Joseph Dunford, also rejected the charges Karzai made Sunday as ""categorically false."" 
 
 But the accusations were just the latest in a series of disputes that have frayed relations between the two nations as the U.S. works to wrap up the war and turn the country's security over to the Afghans. 
 
 Speaking to reporters soon after Karzai made the comments, Dunford said the Afghan leader has never expressed such views to him but said it was understandable that tensions would arise as the coalition balances the need to complete its mission with the Afghans' move to exercise more sovereignty. 
 
 ""We have fought too hard over the past 12 years, we have shed too much blood over the past 12 years, we have done too much to help the Afghan security forces grow over the last 12 years to ever think that violence or instability would be to our advantage,"" said Dunford. 
 
 Dunford's comments came soon after U.S. officials canceled a news conference with Hagel and Karzai because of a security threat _ just a day after a suicide bomber on a bicycle struck outside the Afghan Defense Ministry, killing nine Afghan civilians and wounding 14 others. Hagel heard the explosion from the safe location where he was meeting with Afghan officials but was never in danger. 
 
 The security problems compounded a series of flare-ups in recent weeks, including a dispute that has stalled the transfer of a U.S. prison to Afghan authority as well as Karzai's order to expel U.S. special operations forces out of Wardak province, which lies just outside the capital, because of allegations that Afghans working with the commandos were involved in abusive behavior. 
 
 Hagel said he's known Karzai since soon after the U.S. invasion in late 2001, adding that such extended relationships can often be beneficial, especially when dealing with complicated issues. 
 
 The U.S. and Afghan leaders are in the midst of negotiations over the long-term presence of American forces in Afghanistan beyond the end of 2014, when all combat troops are scheduled to leave. 
 
 U.S. officials would not provide details on the security concerns that led to canceling the news conference. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But Pentagon press secretary George Little said the cancellation was not due to Karzai's earlier comments about the U.S. and the Taliban. 
 
 During a nationally televised speech, Karzai said two suicide bombings that killed 19 people on Saturday _ the one outside the Afghan Defense Ministry and the other near a police checkpoint in eastern Khost province _ show the insurgent group is conducting attacks to help show that international forces will still be needed to keep the peace after their current combat mission ends in 2014. 
 
 ""The explosions in Kabul and Khost yesterday showed that they are at the service of America and at the service of this phrase: 2014. They are trying to frighten us into thinking that if the foreigners are not in Afghanistan, we would be facing these sorts of incidents,"" he said during the speech about the state of Afghan women. 
 
 Karzai is known for making incendiary comments in his public speeches. And Dunford on Sunday said that some of the recent disputes between the U.S.-led coalition and Afghan leaders ""strike at the heart of sovereignty"" and could be more political in nature. He said Karzai may be doing what he needs to do to communicate with the Afghan people and their political leaders outside the government. 
 
 That argument also resonated with Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska. 
 
 ""I was once a politician so I can understand the kind of pressures that especially leaders of countries are always under,"" Hagel said. ""I would hope that, again, we can move forward, and I have confidence we will, and deal with these issues."" 
 
 Dunford rejected the suggestion that the recent friction reflects erosion in the U.S. relationship with Afghanistan. 
 
 ""We do not have a broken relationship, we do not have a lack of trust,"" said Dunford, adding that none of the political dust-ups have bled over into his dealings with his Afghan security force counterparts. He said efforts to train and advise the Afghan security forces have continued and that plans for them to be in the lead for security across the country later this summer are on track.

 Follow Lolita C. Baldor on Twitter: http://twitter.com/lbaldor ||||| KABUL—America's fraught ties with Afghanistan suffered a jarring blow Sunday, when Afghan President Hamid Karzai said during a visit by the new U.S. defense secretary that the Taliban were killing Afghan civilians ""in service to America."" 
 
 The remarks, in a televised speech hours before Mr. Karzai's meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, capped a series of confrontations between the Afghan president and the U.S. over his demands to assert Afghan sovereignty and curtail American military operations. 
 
 Mr. Karzai met Mr. Hagel a day after suspected Taliban suicide bombers killed at least 18 people at the Ministry of Defense in Kabul and in the eastern province of Khost. 
 
 In his address, Mr. Karzai said the U.S. doesn't want to leave the country after the NATO coalition's mandate expires at the end of 2014 because it covets Afghan resources and is talking with Taliban leaders behind his back. 
 
 ""Taliban are every day in talks with America, but in Kabul and Khost they set off bombs to show strength to America,"" Mr. Karzai said. ""The bombs that went off in Kabul and Khost yesterday were not a show of power to America, but were in service to America…It was in the service of foreigners not withdrawing from Afghanistan."" 
 
 U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who took command of coalition forces last month, called Mr. Karzai's charges ""categorically false."" 
 
 ""We have fought too hard over the past 12 years, we have shed too much blood over the last 12 years, we have done too much to help the Afghan security forces grow over the last 12 years to ever think that violence or instability would ever be to our advantage,"" he said. 
 
 Mr. Karzai's remarks blindsided American officials who had hoped to use Mr. Hagel's two-day visit, his first overseas trip as defense secretary, to shore up fragile relations with the Afghan president as the U.S. ends its longest foreign war. 
 
 Though most of the 66,000 U.S. troops now in Afghanistan are slated to go home next year, the U.S. hopes to leave behind an advisory and counterterrorism force that would support the Afghan government after 2014.

 American defense officials now have to assess how much damage Mr. Karzai's allegations will have on their plans, already threatened by discord over whether to grant immunity from prosecution to U.S. troops and by the Afghan leader's refusal to negotiate with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
 
 The war against the Taliban has claimed the lives of 2,179 American service members since 2001, says the casualty tracking website icasualties.org. While the U.S. has held talks with the Taliban in the past, contacts were stalled by the Taliban's refusal to negotiate directly with Kabul. 
 
 Mr. Karzai's speech on Sunday sparked some frank exchanges during Mr. Karzai's dinner at the presidential palace with Mr. Hagel, Gen. Dunford and other officials from both nations, U.S. officials said. Mr. Hagel ""struck the right balance between expressing support for Afghanistan and strongly pushing back on wildly inaccurate claims,"" one U.S. official said. 
 
 After the dinner, Mr. Hagel offered a muted public response to Mr. Karzai's comments that came in contrast to the forceful defense from Gen. Dunford. ""I told the president it was not true that the United States was unilaterally working with the Taliban,"" Mr. Hagel told reporters. 
 
 The defense secretary suggested that the Afghan president might have been baiting America to cultivate support from anti-Western forces in the politically fractured country. Mr. Karzai's term expires next year, and the field of potential successors is wide open, ranging from his brother and other allies to bitter political foes. ""I was once a politician, so I can understand the kind of pressures that especially leaders of countries are always under, so I would hope that, again, we can move forward—and I have confidence that we will,"" Mr. Hagel said. 
 
 The Afghan president's spokesman, Aimal Faizi, said the Afghan leader used the occasion to complain about civilian casualties of U.S. operations and the detentions of Afghan citizens. 
 
 In particular, Mr. Faizi said, Mr. Karzai raised the issue of an engineering student who, he said, had been seized illegally at Kandahar University by an Afghan militia working for the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Karzai mentioned in his speech that he was up until as late as midnight on Saturday to win the student's release; on Sunday, he issued a decree banning foreign forces from entering universities and detaining Afghan students. 
 
 The CIA declined to comment on the matter. 
 
 ""Such incidents, if they continue, are a clear breach of Afghan national sovereignty, and will create anger among the people,"" Mr. Faizi said. ""Any kind of bilateral relations should be based on respect of sovereignty of the two nations."" 
 
 Mr. Karzai gained power following the U.S. ouster of the Taliban regime in 2001, and initially enjoyed close ties with the U.S., holding weekly videoconference calls with President George W. Bush. 
 
 These relations deteriorated during the 2009 Afghan presidential elections, after which Mr. Karzai accused some Obama administration officials of scheming to oust him. 
 
 In previous statements, Mr. Karzai also alleged that the U.S. was secretly flying insurgents into northern Afghanistan in helicopters, as part of a plan to destabilize the country, and once even threatened to join the Taliban himself. 
 
 Mr. Karzai and Mr. Hagel have a strained personal history. In 2008, Mr. Hagel joined fellow Senators Joe Biden and John Kerry for a turbulent dinner in which they pressed the Afghan president to seriously tackle corruption in his government. When Mr. Karzai dismissed the concerns as unfounded, Mr. Biden stormed out of the meeting, throwing down his napkin. 
 
 Mr. Hagel's restrained comments on the Afghan president Sunday suggested that U.S. leaders recognize that they need Mr. Karzai's cooperation to complete the withdrawal of U.S. troops and equipment. Military analysts said Mr. Karzai might be trying to challenge Mr. Hagel, who has orders from President Barack Obama to quickly end the war. 
 
 ""President Karzai has a history of testing new [coalition] commanders to see what the response is to his demands,"" said Kimberly Kagan, founder of the Institute for the Study of War who has consulted with the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan. 
 
 U.S. officials have envisaged that NATO allies would make up a large part of the residual force after 2014. Mr. Karzai, however, on Sunday reiterated his opposition to any deal with NATO as a whole, saying nations wanting to keep troops here would need to negotiate directly with Kabul. 
 
 ""If you want to stay beyond 2014, all of you separately need to sign agreements with the Afghan people,"" Mr. Karzai said Sunday. ""Limited numbers, in a location we chose and under our conditions and framework, with respect for our laws, our sovereignty, our traditions and culture."" 
 
 Few, if any, Western allies would consider contributing troops outside the NATO framework, diplomats say. ""They want us out, that is for sure,"" a Western official said. ""They feel that we are part of the problem."" 
 
 Despite these tensions, Gen. Dunford defended U.S.-Afghan relations, especially between military leaders of the two countries, as dynamic partnerships that can be the ""shock absorbers"" through turbulent times. ""We don't have a broken relationship,"" he said. ""We don't have a lack of trust. We have a relationship that can actually absorb this tension as we work through difficult issues."" 
 
 But Mr. Karzai's Sunday speech was only one such shock to the relationship. It followed the U.S.'s abrupt cancellation of its planned handover of the main U.S. detention facility at Bagram Air Field, and Mr. Karzai's demand that U.S. Special Operations forces leave the strategic province of Wardak near Kabul. 
 
 Following Mr. Karzai's speech, Mr. Hagel also canceled a planned joint news conference with the Afghan leader at the presidential palace. U.S. officials said this was because of security concerns that rippled across Kabul in the wake of Saturday's bombings. 
 
 U.S. bases in the capital were on heightened alert. Mr. Hagel previously canceled scheduled visits to the Ministry of Defense—site of Saturday's Kabul bombing—and the Interior Ministry. Instead, he met with the two ministers at alternative locations in the city.

 Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com","– Chuck Hagel finally did meet privately with Afghan President Hamid Karzai yesterday before returning to Washington today, and despite the security concerns that initially canceled the meeting, Hagel told the press he and Karzai discussed key issues, the AP reports. ""I think he understands where we are and where we've been, and hopefully where we're going together,"" Hagel said, without giving any details. Both Hagel and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top US commander in Afghanistan, rejected comments Karzai made prior to the meeting in which he accused the US and the Taliban of working together to prove the situation in Afghanistan will deteriorate after most US troops withdraw next year. Dunford called the comments ""categorically false"" and said Karzai has never expressed such charges to him personally, but added that tensions are inevitable as withdrawal looms. He added that there is no ""broken relationship"" or ""lack of trust"" between the US and Afghanistan. The security threat, as well as the attacks that rocked Afghanistan during Hagel's visit, were just the latest in a series of recent flare-ups in tension between the US and Afghanistan. Both Hagel and Dunford said Karzai's incendiary comments were likely more political than anything else, citing the pressure Karzai is under.

204,"According to TechCrunch and Daring Fireball , Apple may be planning to unveil the iPad 3 later this fall. If the rumors are true, the appearance of this next-next-generation tablet would be a surprise, especially as it would come so shortly after the iPad 2, and as Apple usually sticks rigidly to its product development cycles. Given that the original iPad went on sale in April, Apple would be expected to release the second version of the tablet around the same time a year later. 
 
 We've now heard that this ""fall surprise"" is related to this would-be iPad 3. We don't have any more concrete information beyond that. But, as of right now, the plan is apparently to release one iteration of the iPad in the next few weeks. And then blow the doors open with another new version in the fall. 
 
 [...] But Apple has a history of not resting on their laurels. That's perhaps the key reason why they've been so successful in recent years. And that's exactly why they strike with the iPad 3 in the fall. ||||| Yes, Apple Is Lining Up For A ""Surprise"" This Fall. And Yes, It's Likely An ""iPad 3"" 
 
 The following may sound a little crazy considering that the iPad 2 has not even been acknowledged or introduced by Apple yet. But from what we’re hearing, the next iteration of the iPad — let’s call it “iPad 3” to keep it simple — may be coming along sooner than people realize. 
 
 Earlier today, HP held a big event in San Francisco to unveil their latest products based around the webOS software that they acquired when they bought Palm last year. One of these devices is a tablet, called TouchPad. The device looks like an iPad, but it has better specs. As such, some are already wondering if it’s a possible “iPad-killer”. Of course, the main problem is that the planned availability of the TouchPad isn’t until this summer. (And worse, there’s absolutely no word on pricing.). Then Daring Fireball’s John Gruber decided to quickly weigh in. 
 
 “Summer feels like a long time away. If my theory is right, they’re not only going to be months behind the iPad 2, but if they slip until late summer, they might bump up against the release of the iPad 3. And not only did they announce this with a distant ship date, they did it with no word on pricing,” he wrote on his site. 
 
 Did you catch the key phrase there? He snuck it in the middle, but it’s definitely there: iPad 3. This immediately led to Business Insider and others to speculate that the iPad 3 could be released this fall. But others weren’t so sure that’s what Gruber meant. They thought that perhaps he was just saying that a summer release would be close to a spring 2012 release for the iPad 3, which would be consistent with Apple’s cycle thus far. 
 
 But we’re hearing something else. Something that does in fact place the iPad 3 in line for release this fall. 
 
 A few days ago, we heard from a very good source that Apple was assembling the pieces for a “big fall surprise”. While intriguing, that could obviously mean anything. But the “surprise” part clearly means it’s something beyond the regular iPod/iTunes (and perhaps MacBook Air) refreshes that Apple does in the fall. Still, that leaves a lot of room for guesses. An actual Apple television? iTunes in the cloud? A touchscreen iMac? Who knows? 
 
 Well, until today. We’ve now heard that this “fall surprise” is related to this would-be iPad 3. We don’t have any more concrete information beyond that. But, as of right now, the plan is apparently to release one iteration of the iPad in the next few weeks. And then blow the doors open with another new version in the fall. 
 
 Obviously, this being Apple, that plan could change at any time. But here’s why it could make some sense. 
 
 While again, Apple hasn’t publicly said the iPad 2 even exists, basically everything is known about it. Just last night, on the eve of the HP event, the Wall Street Journal ran a story confirming not only that the new device was in production, but also confirming many of the specs that have been rumored for months. That includes a front-facing camera, a faster processor, more RAM, and support for both AT&T and Verizon’s networks. The other thing they’ve confirmed is that the device would not have the higher resolution screen that some had been hoping for. For what it’s worth, we’ve heard the exact same thing. The screen of the iPad 2 will be the same resolution as the original iPad. 
 
 So, aside from the camera and it being slimmer (which are a nice additions, but not a game-changing), it sounds like the iPad 2 will be to the iPad 1 what the iPhone 3GS was to the iPhone 3G. That is, a faster, more polished offering. 
 
 And that’s fine. Considering that over a year after its initial unveiling, no one else has a tablet out there yet that can hold a candle to the iPad, adding speed and polish should be more than enough to keep it far ahead this spring. But Apple isn’t stupid. They can see the armies forming around them. Everyone wants in on this tablet business. And come this summer, there should be a few interesting offerings in the space from competitors — like the HP TouchPad. 
 
 The iPad 2 will likely still be ahead of those products. But Apple has a history of not resting on their laurels. That’s perhaps the key reason why they’ve been so successful in recent years. And that’s exactly why they strike with the iPad 3 in the fall. 
 
 Now, I have no details as to what this iPad 3 would include. But one very solid guess is a retina-like display that the iPhone 4 currently has. There’s obviously been many rumors of this for the iPad 2, but it’s not happening yet. But perhaps it could this fall. Another, slightly smaller form factor will clearly be another guess. Steve Jobs has famously played down that idea in the past — but he often does that and turns around with an offering. 
 
 Another interesting question will be how Apple would pitch such a quick upgrade to consumers? Would those who bought the iPad 2 this spring be mad if a new version hits in the fall? Sure. But maybe Apple has more pricing tricks up their sleeve. More to come on this, I’m sure. 
 
 Update: In a new post, Gruber has clarified his “iPad 3” remark. While he calls it an actual guess, he says that he thinks an iPad 3 could hit in September alongside new iPods. And while his reasoning is in some ways the inverse of mine, we arrive at the same conclusion. 
 
 Gruber thinks the new iPad we may see in the fall will be more of a “iPad 2.5”, whereas my guess was the other way around. He thinks the launch date could have more to do with Apple attempting to move the yearly release schedule of the iPad to be closer to the holiday season. Again, that’s just his guess, but it also makes quite a bit of sense. 
 
 And his overall conclusion as to why Apple is okay releasing two iPad iterations in a six month span is: 
 
 But I’m certain that Apple sees the potential and the high stakes. They’re not going to leave any gas in the tank pushing the iPad hardware specs forward as fast as they can. 
 
 Yep. 
 
 Again, to be clear, my information on this isn’t a guess (though my thoughts as to the reasons why Apple would do this are). Apple’s plan, at least right now, is to release another version of the iPad in the fall. That may change, but that is currently the plan. 
 
 Update 2: As as one final update, as Jim Dalrymple of The Loop notes the thing that perhaps makes the most sense: “a new iPad that won’t really replace the iPad 2, but rather add to the product line.” ||||| The software looks great, it really does, but: 
 
 Planned availability this summer.

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department has approved arms sales to Taiwan worth a total of $1.4 billion, the first such deal with the self-governing island since President Donald Trump took office, officials said Thursday. 
 
 The sale will anger China, which regards Taiwan as part of its territory. It comes at a delicate time for relations between Washington and Beijing over efforts to rein in nuclear-armed North Korea. 
 
 The sale to Taiwan comprises seven items, including technical support for early warning radar, anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes and components for SM-2 missiles, according to a U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss the details before they were formally announced. 
 
 State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the Trump administration had notified Congress of its intent to approve seven proposed deals now valued at around $1.4 billion. Nauert said the approvals did not violate the Taiwan Relations Act that governs U.S. contacts with the island. 
 
 ""It shows, we believe, our support for Taiwan's ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense policy,"" Nauert said. ""There's no change, I should point out, to our 'one-China policy.'"" 
 
 Taiwan's defense ministry on Friday thanked the U.S., saying, ""The arms sale will help strengthen our country's self-defense capability and maintain the peace on Taiwan strait."" 
 
 Lawmakers, which are generally strongly supportive of such sales, have 30 days to object. The U.S. is legally obligated to sell weapons to Taiwan for its self-defense. 
 
 The U.S. official said the sales represented upgrades, converting existing systems from analog to digital. The total includes roughly $1.3 million in transactions that are considered ""foreign military sales,"" plus another commercial deal that also requires U.S. government approval and brings the total to $1.4 billion. 
 
 The last U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, worth $1.8 billion, were announced in December 2015. They included two decommissioned U.S. Navy frigates, anti-tank missiles, amphibious assault vehicles and Stinger surface-to-air missiles, and was the first sale for four years. 
 
 China objected strongly, but it did not notably set back U.S.-China relations and military ties, which has happened after past arms sales to Taiwan. 
 
 However, relations across the Taiwan Strait have deteriorated since then, as Taiwan last year elected a leader from an independence-leaning party, Tsai Ing-wen. China has increased diplomatic pressure, cut off its contacts with the island's government and discouraged travel there by Chinese tourists.

 Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Washington and video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei contributed to this report. ||||| The decision by the United States to sell arms to Taiwan was “wrong” and violated a consensus reached when Chinese President Xi Jinping met US President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in April, Beijing told Washington. 
 
 The announcement of the US$1.4 billion deal comes a week ahead of Xi’s planned meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. 
 
 China’s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, told reporters that China firmly opposed the deal. 
 
 “We have expressed firm opposition to the US and we will reserve our right to take further action,” Cui told reporters at an event in Washington to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China. 
 
 A statement issued later by the Chinese embassy in Washington DC criticised the move as a breach of the consensus reached between the two leaders ar their first ever meeting. 
 
 “The wrong move of the US side runs counter to the consensus reached by the two presidents in Mar-a-Lago and the positive development momentum of the China-US relationship,” its said. 
 
 The arms sales package was announced by a US State Department spokeswoman on Thursday. 
 
 It comprises seven items, including technical support for early warning radar, anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes and components for SM-2 missiles, Associated Press reported. 
 
 The US Congress had been notified of the sale, State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, told a daily press briefing. 
 
 A US State Department official added in an email: “Today’s notifications are consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and our support for Taiwan’s ability to maintain a sufficient self-defence capability. 
 
 “There is no change to our longstanding ‘one-China’ policy based on the Three Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act.” 
 
 The announcement came a day after the US Senate Armed Services Committee approved a bill that would allow regular stops by US naval vessels at Taiwan’s ports as part of an annual defence policy measure. 
 
 China responded to the bill with anger. “We are strongly concerned about and firmly opposed to the bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee,” Lu Kang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Thursday. 
 
 “The Taiwan question bears on China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and belongs to China’s domestic affairs,” Lu said. “We urge the US to honour its commitment on the Taiwan question, immediately stop military contact and arms sales to Taiwan and avoid causing damage to the bilateral relationship and bilateral cooperation in a broader range of areas.” 
 
 Taiwan soothed by US arms sales support after Panama picks Beijing over Taipei 
 
 China’s Defence Ministry spokesman Senior Colonel Wu Qian also condemned the move. 
 
 “We are always firmly opposed to any form of official contact and military interaction between Taiwan and the US. 
 
 “We urge the American side to abide by its commitment to the Chinese side with regard to the Taiwan issue and stop military contacts with Taiwan, so as not to cause damage to the relations between the two militaries and the two countries as well as to the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Wu said in a press briefing. 
 
 Beijing considers Taiwan to be a breakaway Chinese province and tries to deter all countries from having formal ties with the island. US defence ties with Taiwan are a particularly sensitive issue. 
 
 Trump’s meeting with Xi at the G20 will be their second since the US president took office in January. The two met for a summit at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April, which set the course for a series of high-level dialogues. 
 
 The Taiwan Relations Act, which guarantees US support for the self-governing island’s defence capacity, was signed in 1979, shortly after the US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.

 “We are always aware that there are some negative things in our relationship”, Ambassador Cui said in Washington. “Our job is to make sure the positive development will be overwhelming, and we will continue to try the best to keep the relations on the right track.” 
 
 The last round of US arms sales to Taiwan was approved by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama in 2015. The US sold about US$1.8 billion worth of equipment to Taiwan in that round, including frigates, missiles and amphibious assault vehicles, according to the Federal Register, a US government publication. 
 
 Every US president has approved arms sales to Taiwan since the Taiwan Act became law, starting with Jimmy Carter in his last year in office. ||||| (CNN) The US' decision to go ahead with the sale of a $1.4 billion arms package to Taiwan threatens to undermine US-Chinese relations, China's ambassador to Washington said. 
 
 Speaking to the People's Daily newspaper Thursday, Ambassador Cui Tiankai said recent US moves eroded the trust built when US President Donald Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida in April. 
 
 ""US arms sales to Taiwan and the sanctions against Chinese enterprises have damaged the basis and mutual trust between the two countries, it also contradicts the spirit and consensus of the two leaders' meeting in Mar A Lago,"" said Cui. 
 
 A statement released by the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that the sale of arms to Taiwan ""grossly interferes"" in China's domestic affairs. ""The Chinese side has lodged serious representation to the US side, and reserves every right to take further action,"" read the statement. 
 
 On Thursday, the Trump administration notified Congress of its plans to go ahead with the controversial arms package, the first such sale under President Trump. 
 
 State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the agreement included ""seven proposed defense sales for Taiwan,"" adding that the deal was valued at ""about $1.42 billion."" 
 
 A US official familiar with the deal told CNN that the package would include advanced missiles and torpedoes including the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon and MK 48 6AT Heavy Weight Torpedoes. 
 
 It will also include technical support for an early warning radar system. 
 
 The Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, signaled strong support for the sale, calling it ""long overdue"" in a statement issued shortly after its announcement. 
 
 Congress has 30 days to raise any objections to the deal. 
 
 The announcement of the arms sale comes the same day the US Treasury Department announced a series of sanctions and measures that would among other things, sever US financial ties with China's Bank of Dandong, which the administration claims acts as a pipeline to support alleged illicit North Korean financial activity. 
 
 Both announcements came during Trump's meeting with South Korea's new president Moon Jae-in at the White House. Both leaders are anxious to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile program. 
 
 US relations with China 
 
 The unexpected timing of the deal -- which comes while Chinese President Xi is in Hong Kong commemorating the 20th anniversary of the city's return to China -- surprised many analysts. Zhang Baohui, professor of political science at Lingnan University, said until this week many high-profile Taiwanese had believed the US was moving away from them. 
 
 ""(This arms deal) didn't go through for a while and some people suspected it was due to Trump's so-called reliance on China to resolve the North Korea issue ... so I think this arms sale could boost confidence (in US),"" he said. 
 
 China considers self-governing democratic Taiwan a renegade province and Beijing has not ruled out using military force to bring Taiwan under its rule. 
 
 The US does not recognize Taiwan -- officially known as the Republic of China -- as an independent country, and adheres to the ""one China"" policy, which means it does not maintain an official relationship with Taiwan. 
 
 Nauert added that there was no change to the ""one China"" policy. 
 
 ""Today's notifications are consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, and our support for Taiwan's ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,"" a US official familiar with the sale told CNN. 
 
 Under the Taiwan Relations Act the US is legally required to provide Taiwan with the ability to defend itself.

 In a move that seemed to portend a shift in US policy, President-elect Trump spoke to Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-Wen i n a phone call in December , upending decades of diplomatic protocol. 
 
 However, the Trump administration has since said that it remains committed to the decades-long ""one China"" policy. 
 
 China has long criticized US arms sales to Taiwan. 
 
 Taiwan's Ministry of Defense said in a statement Friday morning they were ""sincerely grateful"" for the US decision to go ahead with the arms deal. 
 
 ""The arms sale was proposed by our country last year. The package includes eight types of equipment and system, which will boost our combat capabilities in air and sea,"" the statement said. 
 
 The State Department also issued a statement marking the 20th anniversary of the transfer of Hong Kong from the UK to China, saying the US was ""concerned about any infringements on civil liberties"" in Hong Kong. 
 
 It is unknown how the announcements will impact on Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the meeting of the G20 next month.","– The State Department announced Thursday that the US has reached a $1.4 billion arms deal with Taiwan; a source tells CNN it includes the sale of advanced missiles and torpedoes and technical support for early warning radar. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense said Friday it is ""sincerely grateful"" for the deal, ""which will boost our combat capabilities in air and sea."" But China is far less pleased. More: It's about protection: A US official tells CNN the deal shows ""our support for Taiwan's ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability""—something the US is required to do under the Taiwan Relations Act signed in 1979. It's not unusual: The South China Morning Post notes every US president since Jimmy Carter has OKed arms sales to Taiwan. Former President Obama approved a $1.8 billion sale in 2015. Timing: This deal, however, comes at a ""delicate time"" in US-China relations, with tensions already high over North Korea, reports the AP. One China: A State Department rep says the US remains committed to its ""one-China"" policy, meaning it will not carry on an official relationship with Taiwan and does not consider it to be its own country. China views Taiwan as part of its territory. But China is peeved: The Chinese Embassy in Washington calls the deal a ""wrong move"" that ""grossly interferes"" in China's domestic affairs, per the Morning Post, adding China ""reserves every right to take further action."" What about Mar-a-Lago?

206,"Japan's JAXA space agency launched a cargo shuttle carrying more than four tons of food, water, and supplies to the International Space Station on Friday. And, there's a really long whip. 
 
 Japan's H-IIB rocket with a capsule called Kounotori, or stork, lifts off at the Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, southern Japan, on Friday. The Japanese capsule contains nearly 5 tons of food, water and other supplies, including new lithium-ion batteries for the International Space Station’s solar power system. 
 
 Japan’s space program, JAXA, soars this weekend after its robotic cargo spacecraft began its four-day journey to the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday. 
 
 Onboard the spacecraft, called Kounotori (after the Japanese word for “white stork""), are more than four tons of cargo, including JAXA’s massive debris clearing space whip and a new array of lithium ion batteries for the space station’s solar arrays. 
 
 Friday’s cargo launch is particularly important after the failure of a Russian Progress cargo launch earlier this month. Several other cargo launches have met similar fates over the past two years. This is JAXA’s sixth cargo launch to the ISS. 
 
 ""Spaceflight's not an easy thing,"" said NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson in an interview aboard the ISS. ""We just have to keep pressing ourselves to do the right thing, make sure we're doing all the right tests ... so that we don't have these problems,"" the Associated Press reported. 
 
 Other supplies being delivered by Kounotori include several tons of food and water. The batteries being ferried by the craft will also be immensely helpful for the ISS crew members, who plan to replace the older nickel-hydrogen batteries now used to store energy from the station’s solar panels. 
 
 Perhaps the most interesting piece of cargo, however, is a 2,296-foot tether made of aluminum and steel. Space experts hope to use this tether to help clean up the more than 20,000 pieces of space debris that have been judged “potentially hazardous” to further space exploration, as NPR reported. 
 
 Scientists have been concerned about space debris for a long time. After six decades of space exploration, hundreds of old satellite pieces and miscellaneous space junk now litter the Earth's orbit zone that many satellites must traverse. As long ago as 1984, the European Space Administration (ESA) began concerned about the dangers this debris might pose. 
 
 “Up to now, there has been more concern about radio interference among satellites than about collision. But as ESA points out, a collision would not only damage satellites, it would create a cloud of debris. There would be a growing and uncontrollable risk of further collisions,” reported The Christian Science Monitor’s Robert Cowan in 1984. 
 
 “Thus it seems that development of the space frontier has already reached a level where neighborhood trash removal has become a necessity.” 
 
 This May, the ISS itself was damaged by a tiny flying piece of debris when it hit the windows of the station’s cupola. The debris, which scientists speculate was likely a flake of paint or small piece of metal, caused a chip in the cupola’s window. While the ISS was built to withstand strikes such as the one in May, the incident is indicative of a bigger problem. 
 
 Today, NASA says that it is tracking more than 500,000 pieces of space debris in orbit, all of which could severely damage a satellite or spacecraft. Pieces smaller than a single centimeter are dangerous enough, NASA says, but anything larger than a single centimeter could penetrate the shields of the ISS. 
 
 And when two or more pieces of debris strike each other, the result is thousands more pieces of potentially dangerous junk orbiting the planet. 
 
 JAXA hopes to eliminate some of this problem with its massive electrodynamic space tether, which the agency hopes will be able to snag and redirect larger pieces of space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where they will burn up and become harmless upon entry. 
 
 If the space tether works, it will be good news for space agencies. Unfortunately, however, JAXA will only have one shot at using the “space whip” on the Kounotori’s return trip to Earth before the cargo shuttle burns up upon re-entry. ||||| Japan Sends Long Electric Whip Into Orbit, To Tame Space Junk 
 
 Enlarge this image toggle caption JAXA JAXA 
 
 A cable that's as long as six football fields has been launched into orbit — and when it's deployed, it'll test an idea to knock out orbital debris. Japan's space agency sent the electrodynamic tether into space along with supplies for the International Space Station. 
 
 Reels aboard the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Kounotori 6 craft will deploy the 700-meter (2,296 feet) tether, essentially unspooling a clothesline in space that could help clean up the roughly 20,000 pieces of potentially hazardous space debris that are tracked by systems on Earth. 
 
 Those pieces of junk are dangerous enough on their own — but they can also generate thousands more smaller pieces of debris if they collide, creating even more risk to the space station and satellites orbiting the Earth. 
 
 With the official acronym of EDT (for electrodynamic tether), the Kounotori's cable ""is a promising candidate to deorbit the debris objects at low cost,"" JAXA says. 
 
 As illustrated by a video, the Japanese agency's plan is to use the electrified tether — counter-weighted by a 20 kilogram (44-pound) end mass — to slow down and redirect space junk into a safe but fiery reentry into the atmosphere. 
 
 YouTube 
 
 According to the video, the tether will be able to change its position relative to the Kounotori craft by the use of force that's generated by an electric current and the Earth's magnetic field. The video also depicts the tether being attached to a large piece of debris so the space trash can be guided down into a destructive reentry. 
 
 Space debris has been seen as a problem for years — back in 2011, the National Research Council said the number of items had reached ""tipping point"" in terms of the dangers they posed to astronauts and spacecraft. 
 
 As we reported last year, ""According to the Royal Institution in London, there are about 20,000 pieces of tracked space debris, ranging from larger than an apple to as big as a school bus. (There are far more objects smaller than that, including millions of pieces of debris too tiny to track, according to NASA.)"" 
 
 There's a good chance we could see video of the new JAXA system being tested: Deployment of the tether will be monitored by cameras aboard the Kounotori. 
 
 According to JAXA, the Kounotori is scheduled to dock at the International Space Station on Dec. 14; the tether won't be unleashed until the Kounotori leaves the space station bearing a new cargo of waste — with the entire craft destined to burn up on reentry. ||||| Space isn’t so empty these days. Earth’s orbit is cluttered with more than half a million bits of debris, mostly rocket and satellite remnants that can wreck anything in their flight path. 
 
 A 106-year-old Japanese fishing net maker may have a solution. Nitto Seimo Co. is working with Japan’s space agency to develop a mesh material to tether and drag bus-size pieces of space junk into the atmosphere for incineration. Scientists will get their first indication of whether the metallic line will work when it’s tested in orbit next month, said project chief Koichi Inoue, an associate principal researcher at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

 The experiment is part of an international cleanup effort planning to safeguard astronauts and about $900 billion worth of space stations, satellites and other infrastructure relied on for telecommunications, weather forecasting, Earth-monitoring and navigation. With debris traveling at up to 17,500 miles an hour, the impact of even a marble-size projectile can cause catastrophic damage as portrayed in the Academy Award-winning movie Gravity.

 “We need to take action on this massive amount of debris,” Inoue said at the JAXA campus in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. “People haven’t been injured by the debris yet, but satellites have. We have to act.” 
 
 Harpooning Junk 
 
 Spacefaring nations around the world are pursuing different strategies for harpooning, sweeping, lassoing and dragging debris and redundant gear of varying sizes into the atmosphere for burning or into a so-called graveyard orbit, where they can’t collide with operational equipment. NASA’s Hubble Telescope has a 1-centimeter hole in one of its dish antennas, and solar panels have been cracked and chipped by tiny debris, according to its website. 
 
 “There’s a significant value to the industry of mitigating that risk,” said Ben Greene, chief executive officer of Sydney-based Electro Optic Systems Holdings Ltd., which is developing land-based laser technology to track and alter the course of space debris smaller than a flat-screen TV. The space industry has spent A$300 million ($230 million) during the past five years trying to quantify the risk of accidents caused by junk, he said. 
 
 The global launch industry is booming, with revenue of $5.4 billion last year, according to the Satellite Industry Association. That’s a 23 percent increase since 2010. A total of 202 military, commercial and scientific satellites were launched last year. 
 
 The program in Japan “is terribly valuable,” Greene said. “It’s technically sound. There’s no reason not to do it, but it only works for really huge pieces of junk.” 
 
 Knotless Net 
 
 Nitto Seimo started making minnow nets in 1910 and invented the knotless net machine in 1925. Japan’s largest maker of fishing nets was asked by the space agency about a decade ago to develop a metal mesh line, said Katsuya Suzuki, a subsection chief who previously oversaw the project for the Tokyo-based company. JAXA wanted mesh, instead of a single cable, because it would be harder to break.

 “It was extremely difficult,” said Suzuki, whose employer also makes nets for trawling, fish farming and keeping animals out of agricultural areas. “At first, we could only make 20 or 30 centimeters. It took us until about 2010 until we could finally make several hundred meters.” 
 
 The aluminum-containing line is designed to harness Earth’s electromagnetic forces to propel tethered objects out of orbit and into the atmosphere for destruction. Nitto Seimo may build a line as long as 10 kilometers if next month’s experiment using a 700-meter piece is successful, Suzuki said. 
 
 The company spent 20 million-30 million yen ($195,000-$295,000) building a machine to make the conductive material, and it wants a working prototype by 2025. 
 
 Station Moved 
 
 JAXA wants to run a second test of its tethering approach as early as 2020, Inoue said, adding that the costs of mitigating damage from orbital debris are hastening the organization’s efforts. 
 
 “The International Space Station has to be moved to avoid it,” he said. “That costs money and time, which cuts back on working time.” 
 
 Satellite collisions and testing of anti-satellite weapons have added thousands of debris fragments in the atmosphere since 2007, according to NASA.

 The problem is getting more pressing as space becomes more popular. At least 19 countries have, are developing or are planning to host spaceports for orbital or suborbital launches, the Colorado-based nonprofit Space Foundation said in its 2016 Space Report. 
 
 “Debris hitting debris creates more debris, so you have this cascade effect and end up with so much space debris that it becomes a real danger to operational satellites and new launches,” said Steve Gower, general manager of the Space Environment Research Centre in Canberra, Australia, that also gets funding from Japan and the U.S. “Every time we launch a satellite, we need to plan a path to avoid space junk.”","– Can a whip as long as six football fields destroy some of the 500,000 pieces of space junk spinning around Earth at 17,500 miles per hour? Japan's space agency sure hopes so. JAXA launched its Kounotori 6 spacecraft on Friday with tons of supplies bound for the International Space Station, where it's expected to arrive on Wednesday, reports NPR. Also on board is a 2,300-feet electrodynamic tether, or EDT, made of aluminum and steel, in the works for more than a decade. JAXA says it will use an electric current and Earth's magnetic field to slow down debris and shove it out of orbit and toward Earth's atmosphere, where it will burn up. The EDT and the Kounotori, which will also carry waste from the ISS, will then meet the same fate. It's unclear how many pieces of space junk might be destroyed using the EDT, but this is mostly a test. If all goes well, JAXA plans to create a second tether up to six miles in length, reports Bloomberg. The BBC notes this is one of a few efforts underway to tackle space junk, which poses hazards for astronauts and their equipment. In May, for example, a tiny piece of space junk—possibly a speck of paint—chipped a window in the ISS' Cupola observatory, reports Christian Science Monitor. As the ISS wouldn't stand a chance against some debris as large as a bus, it has to be moved to avoid an impact, says project chief Koichi Inoue. Kounotori's EDT ""is a promising candidate to deorbit the debris objects at low cost,"" JAXA says.

207,"The prospect of a North Korean missile launch is ""considerably high,"" South Korea's foreign minister told lawmakers Wednesday as Pyongyang prepared to mark the April 15 birthday of its founder, historically a time when it seeks to draw the world's attention with dramatic displays of military power. 
 
 The missile is expected to be a medium-range Musudan missile with a range of 3,500 kilometers (2,180 miles) capable of flying over Japan, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told lawmakers in Seoul. Earlier a Defense Ministry official said preparations appeared to be complete, and that the launch could take place at any time. 
 
 North Korean officials have not announced plans to launch a missile, but have told foreign diplomats in Pyongyang that it will not be able to guarantee their safety starting Wednesday. It has also urged tourists in South Korea to take cover, warning a nuclear war was imminent. Still, most diplomats and foreign residents appeared to be staying put. 
 
 Such threats are seen as rhetoric and an attempt by North Korea to scare foreigners into pressing their governments to pressure Washington and Seoul to change their policies toward Pyongyang, and to boost the military credentials of its young leader, Kim Jong Un. 
 
 On the streets of Pyongyang the focus was less on preparing for war and more on beautifying the city ahead of the nation's biggest holiday. Soldiers hammered away on construction projects, gardeners got down on their knees to plant flowers and trees, and students marched off to school, belying the high tensions. 
 
 Last year, the days surrounding the centennial of the birth of Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current ruler, was marked by parades of tanks, goose-stepping soldiers and missiles, as well as the failed launch of a satellite-carrying rocket widely believed by the U.S. and its allies in the West to be a test of ballistic missile technology. A subsequent test in December went off successfully, and that was followed by the country's third underground nuclear test on Feb. 12 this year, possibly taking the regime closer to mastering the technology for mounting an atomic bomb on a missile. 
 
 The resulting U.N. sanctions and this spring's annual U.S.-South Korean military drills have been met with an unending string of threats and provocations from the North. 
 
 Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday that North Korea's persistent nuclear and missile programs and threats have created ""an environment marked by the potential for miscalculation."" 
 
 He said the U.S. military and its allies would be ready if North Korea tries to strike. 
 
 The Musadan is a ballistic missile, and South Korea says its launch would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution banning any ballistic activity by North Korea. 
 
 Despite such tidings of war, the people of Pyongyang went about their daily lives. 
 
 Associated Press journalists in the North Korean capital saw soldiers wearing hard hats rumbling past in the back of a truck as they prepared for another day's work doing construction. In recent years, military personnel have been pressed into helping build the many urban renewal projects that have been prioritized since Kim Jong Un came to power in December 2011. 
 
 In a sign they have been diverted away from preparing for conventional warfare, they are commonly referred to as ""soldier-builders,"" and are also called upon to help plant and harvest rice and other crops in a nation that suffers from chronic food shortages. 
 
 North Korea sporadically holds civil air raid drills during which citizens practice blacking out their windows and seeking shelter. But no such drills have been held in recent months, local residents said. 
 
 ""I'm not at all worried. We have confidence in our young marshal"" Kim Jong Un, a cleaning lady at the Koryo Hotel said as she made up a guest's bed. ""The rest of the world can just squawk all they want but we have confidence in his leadership. 
 
 ""We are resolved to stay and defend him until the end,"" she said. ""It may be hard for the rest of the world to understand, and those who are worried are welcome to leave,"" she said in typically nationalistic language. 
 
 But there was no sign of an exodus of foreigners from Seoul or Pyongyang. Britain and other governments with embassies in Pyongyang said they had no immediate plans to withdraw but would continue assessing the situation. 
 
 North Korea has been escalating tensions with the U.S. and South Korea, its wartime foes, for months. The tightened U.N. sanctions that followed the nuclear test drew the ire of North Korea, which accused Washington and Seoul of leading the campaign against it. Annual U.S.-South Korean military drills south of the border have further incensed Pyongyang, which sees them as practice for an invasion. 
 
 Last week, Kim Jong Un enshrined the pursuit of nuclear weapons _ which the North characterizes as a defense against the U.S. _ as a national goal, along with improving the economy. North Korea also declared it would restart a mothballed nuclear complex. 
 
 Citing the tensions with Seoul, North Korea on Monday pulled more than 50,000 workers from the Kaesong industrial park, which combines South Korean technology and know-how with cheap North Korean labor. It was the first time that production was stopped at the decade-old factory park, the only remaining symbol of economic cooperation between the Koreas. 
 
 Pyongyang also has moved to its eastern seaboard what is believed by U.S. and South Korean intelligence to be a mid-range missile capable of hitting targets in Japan, such as the U.S. military installations on that country's main island, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam. South Korean officials say North Korea will likely test-fire the missile into the sea as a display of its military prowess. 
 
 The United States and South Korea have raised their defense postures, as has Japan, which deployed PAC-3 missile interceptors in key locations around Tokyo. And Locklear said the U.S. military would be ready to strike back if provoked. 
 
 One historian, James Person, noted that it isn't the first time North Korea has warned foreign embassies to prepare for a U.S. attack. 
 
 He said that in 1968, following North Korea's seizure of an American ship, the USS Pueblo, Pyongyang persistently advised foreign diplomats to prepare for a U.S. counterattack. Cables from the Romanian mission in Pyongyang showed embassies were instructed to build anti-air bunkers ""to protect foreigners against air attacks,"" he said. 
 
 The cables were obtained and posted online by the Wilson Center's North Korea International Documentation Project. 
 
 Person called it one of North Korea's first forays into what he dubs ""military adventurism."" 
 
 ""In 1968, there was some concern there would be an attack, but (the North Koreans) certainly were building it up to be more than it was in hopes of getting more assistance from their allies at the time,"" Person said by phone from Alexandria, Virginia. 
 
 ""I think much of it was hot air then. Today, I think again it's more hot air,"" he said. ""The idea is to scare people into pressuring the United States to return to negotiations with North Korea. That's the bottom line.""

 Recent North Korean threats contrast with some of its other state news reports 
 
 North Korea is ""skating very close to a dangerous line"" after weeks of saber-rattling, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned Wednesday as northeast Asia watched for an expected missile test. 
 
 ""Their actions and their words have not helped defuse a combustible situation,"" Hagel told reporters at the Pentagon. He said the United States and its allies want to see North Korean rhetoric ""ratcheted down,"" but if that doesn't happen, ""our country is fully prepared to deal with any contingency.""

 Cheney to GOP leaders: 'We're in deep doo-doo' on North Korea 
 
 Since December, North Korea has put a satellite in orbit atop a long-range rocket; conducted a nuclear bomb test, its third since 2006; and claimed to be prepared for pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States, though most analysts believe it does not yet have that capability. 
 
 The north has given ample warning to the world before previous long-range rocket launches -- but it is keeping everyone guessing about what it might do this time around. 
 
 Intelligence suggests that North Korea may be planning ""multiple missile launches"" in the coming days beyond two Musudan mobile missiles it has placed along its east coast, Pentagon officials told CNN. The officials did not have specifics on the numbers of other missiles and launchers. 
 
 One official said the North Koreans are military ""masters of deception,"" and may have planned all along to focus the world's attention on the Musudans while they plan multiple launches of other missiles. That's a tactic they have used in the past, the official said. 
 
 The United States is less troubled about the other missiles, a second Pentagon official told CNN. 
 
 ""We've been seeing some launchers moving around. These are smaller and don't cause us as much concerns,"" that official said. ""We think these movements are within seasonal norms for their exercises."" 
 
 But he didn't discount the possibility that they might launch some of those, as they often do. 
 
 The Musudan is an untested weapon that South Korea says has a range as far as 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles). That would mean it could reach as far as Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases and where the United States recently said it was placing missile defense systems. 
 
 After a launch, U.S. satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as Japan. 
 
 The United States and Japan would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down, U.S. officials say. 
 
 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday told CNN that despite being an ally of North Korea, it stands with the United States.

 ""On North Korea, we have no differences with the United States. One just shouldn't scare anyone with military maneuvers and there's a chance things might calm down,"" he said. 
 
 U.S., North Korean officials met secretly in March 
 
 A launch without warning? 
 
 South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said at a parliamentary hearing Wednesday that ""according to intelligence obtained by our side and the U.S., the possibility of a missile launch by North Korea is very high,"" the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. 
 
 Yun said he was basing his assessment on South Korean and U.S. intelligence. 
 
 On Tuesday, a U.S. official said that the American government believes a test launch could happen at any time and without North Korea issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping that would warn planes and vessels to stay away from the missile's path. 
 
 The official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information, cautioned that most of the information comes from satellite imagery, so it's impossible to reach a definitive conclusion because the United States cannot gather information on the ground. 
 
 He said the launch could be ""imminent"" but also cautioned that the United States ""simply doesn't know."" Based on what the United States has seen, the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch. 
 
 Speaking at a Senate Armed Services hearing Tuesday, Locklear said the U.S. military would not want to shoot down a North Korean missile whose trajectory would send it into the open sea. But he said if a missile's path appeared to threaten a U.S. ally, such as Japan, interceptor missiles could be used to try to bring it down. 
 
 Japan poised to react 'calmly' 
 
 Japan's deployment of missile defenses in Tokyo follows similar measures taken ahead of the North's rocket launches last year. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Tuesday that his government would do ""calmly"" whatever needed to be done to protect its population. 
 
 In a sign of the level of concern, however, the port city of Yokohama had to apologize for prematurely publishing a warning of a missile launch on the Twitter page of its emergency management agency. The tweet was up for about 20 minutes before being removed. 
 
 The agency said that the misleading tweet was caused by human error and that it would work on changing its system to prevent the problem from happening again. 
 
 Since the U.N. Security Council voted last month to impose new sanctions on Kim's regime over the latest North Korean nuclear test, Pyongyang has kept up a steady flow of words and acts that could give the impression of a nation heading inexorably toward conflict. 
 
 On Tuesday, it advised foreigners in South Korea to secure shelter or evacuate the country in case of hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, the latest in a string of ominous warnings. 
 
 It also kept more than 50,000 of its workers from an industrial complex jointly operated with South Korea, which had been a key symbol of cooperation between the two countries. 
 
 North Korea's war of words escalates: A timeline of the crisis 
 
 'Holiday atmosphere' inside North Korea 
 
 But on the same day, state media published articles that described festive events and international visits, suggesting a much less fraught situation inside North Korea. 
 
 The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that various sporting events were happening or scheduled to take place to mark the 101st anniversary next week of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. 
 
 ""The ongoing sports tournaments make the country seethe with holiday atmosphere,"" KCNA said. Kim Il Sung's birthday, known as the Day of the Sun, is a major public holiday in North Korea. 
 
 The planned events include an international marathon Sunday in Pyongyang in which runners from North Korea and other countries will participate. KCNA also noted Tuesday the arrival by plane in North Korea of a delegation from the Japan-Korea Society for Scientific and Educational Interchange. 
 
 Such visits sit strangely alongside the North's warning last week to foreign diplomats in Pyongyang that it wouldn't be able to guarantee their safety in the event of a conflict. 
 
 Some North Korea watchers have observed that the regime's domestic propaganda has focused recently on efforts to promote economic development, while the bellicose threats appear targeted primarily at a foreign audience.

 The angry rhetoric has also failed to alarm South Koreans, who have lived through decades of North Korean bombast. Residents of Seoul have continued to go unflappably about their daily business. 
 
 ""South Korea has been living under such threats from the past, and we are always prepared for it,"" South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae told CNN on Wednesday. He called the current climate ""a very ordinary situation."" 
 
 ""North Korea may launch missiles at any time, and our military is fully prepared for it,"" he said. 
 
 But the North's fiery words appear to have had an effect on the American public, with 41% of those surveyed saying they see the reclusive nation as an immediate threat to the United States, according to a recent CNN/ORC International poll. 
 
 That's up 13 percentage points in less than a month, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. 
 
 ""If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wanted to get the attention of the American public, his strategy is starting to work,"" Holland said. 
 
 Andrei Lankov, a professor of history at Kookmin University in Seoul, noted the varying levels of concern in an opinion article for The New York Times published Tuesday. 
 
 ""The farther one is from the Korean Peninsula, the more one will find people worried about the recent developments here,"" he said. 
 
 The tense situation does appear to have prompted some Chinese tour groups to call off upcoming trips to North Korea. 
 
 Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday that some agencies and tourists had canceled plans, but he said the Chinese-North Korean border continued to operate normally. 
 
 Western tourism agencies that organize visits to North Korea haven't so far reported any changes to their activities. 
 
 DMZ: Tensions high at knife-edge of Korean conflict 
 
 A troubled industrial zone 
 
 The most tangible signs of disruption are in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the manufacturing zone on the North Korean side of the border where more than 120 South Korean companies operate. 
 
 Last week, the North started blocking South Korean personnel from crossing the border back into the complex. And this week, it said it was pulling out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work inside the zone and temporarily suspending activities there. 
 
 It had blocked the border crossing previously, in 2009, but pulling out the workers was a new step. 
 
 As of Wednesday lunchtime, only a few hundred South Koreans remained inside the complex, according to South Korean authorities, down from more than 800 before the North started restricting entry. 
 
 Also on Wednesday, South Korea accused the North of carrying out a wave of cyberattacks that paralyzed the networks of major South Korean banks and broadcasters last month. It is the first time that Seoul has formally pointed the finger at Pyongyang for the hacking, which affected more than 48,000 computers. ||||| Updated 2:00 p.m. Eastern 
 
 WASHINGTON U.S. defenses could intercept a ballistic missile launched by North Korea, the top U.S. military commander in the Pacific said Tuesday, as the relationship between the West and the communist government hit its lowest ebb since the end of the Korean War. 
 
 Nuclear threats against the U.S. 
 
 Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Kim Jong Un, the country's young and still relatively untested new leader, has used the past year to consolidate his power. 
 
 The admiral said Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles represents a clear threat to the United States and its allies in the region. 
 
 During an exchange with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Locklear said the U.S. military has the capability to thwart a North Korean strike, but he said a decision on whether a missile should be intercepted should be based on where it is aimed and expected to land. 
 
 ""I believe we have the ability to defend the homeland, Guam, Hawaii and defend our allies,"" said Locklear, who added that it wouldn't take long to determine where a missile would strike. 
 
 Missile Map North Korea 
 
 Locklear concurred with McCain's assessment that the tension between North Korea and the West was the worst since the end of the Korean War in the early 1950s. But the admiral insisted that the U.S. military and its allies would be ready if North Korea tried to strike. 
 
 ""We're ready,"" Locklear said. 
 
 He said North Korea is keeping a large percentage of its combat forces along the demilitarized zone with South Korea, a position that allows the North to threaten U.S. and South Korean civilian and military personnel. 
 
 Locklear told the panel, ""The continued advancement of the North's nuclear and missile programs, its conventional force posture and its willingness to resort to asymmetric actions as a tool of coercive diplomacy creates an environment marked by the potential for miscalculation. ..."" 
 
 North Korea warns foreigners to leave South Korea 
 
 Increasingly bellicose rhetoric has come from Pyongyang and its leader, with North Korea urging foreign companies and tourists to leave South Korea and warning that the countries are on the verge of a nuclear war. 
 
 The U.S. embassy in Seoul tells CBS News its security status is unchanged, despite Tuesday's warning. It says it's not telling Americans to evacuate, and Secretary of State John Kerry is still scheduled to visit Friday, reports CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan. 
 
 Still, North Korea's earlier warning that it won't be able to guarantee the safety of foreign diplomats after April 10 has raised fears that it will conduct a missile or nuclear test on Wednesday, resulting in U.S. retaliation. South Korea's military has reported missile movements on North Korea's east coast but nothing pointed toward South Korea. 
 
 But, as Brennan reports, North Korea has not filed the customary Notice to Airmen - a procedure it usually takes before a test - leading to further uncertainty about whether they will follow through on their threats. 
 
 Tensions escalate on Korean peninsula 
 
 At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney brushed off the North's declaration that nuclear war was imminent as ""more unhelpful rhetoric"" and part of a pattern of combative statements and behavior that Pyongyang's leadership has demonstrated for years. He said the U.S. was working with Seoul and Tokyo on the issue. 
 
 ""It is unhelpful, it is concerning, it is provocative,"" Carney said. 
 
 Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., told Locklear that the North Korean government's threats ""appear to exceed its capabilities, and its use of what capabilities it has against the U.S. or our allies seems highly unlikely and would be completely contrary to the regime's primary goal of survival."" 
 
 ""Nonetheless, its words and actions are not without consequences,"" Levin said. 
 
 The Democrat questioned the Obama administration's decision to delay a long-scheduled operational test of an intercontinental ballistic missile amid the North Korea rhetoric. 
 
 Locklear said he agreed with the decision to delay the test. 
 
 ""We have demonstrated to the people of the region, demonstrated to the leadership of North Korea, our ability and willingness to defend our nation, our people, our allies and our forward deployed forces,"" Locklear said, citing other steps the U.S. military has taken in recent weeks. 
 
 The U.S. has moved two of the Navy's missile-defense ships closer to the Korean peninsula, and a land-based system is being deployed to the Pacific territory of Guam. The U.S. also called attention to the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercise that included a practice run over South Korea by B-2 stealth bombers. 
 
 Levin mentioned that President Barack Obama recently talked to China's new president, Xi Jinping, about the U.S. efforts to deal with North Korea. Locklear said he has not had similar conversations with his Chinese counterparts. 
 
 In an exchange with Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, Locklear acknowledged a hotline connection between Washington and Beijing similar to what existed with Moscow during the Cold War, and said both sides need to move forward in continuing conversations. 
 
 Locklear told Levin that he would explore the possibility of making direct contact with his military counterparts in China and communicate with them the seriousness of the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
 
 Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., insisted that North Korea's nuclear program could come to a ""grinding halt"" if China pressured Pyongyang. 
 
 Reflecting the uneasy relationship, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Locklear if he considers China a ""friend or a foe."" Locklear said neither. 
 
 ""I consider (China), at this point in time, someone we have to develop a strategic partnership with to manage competition between two world powers,"" Locklear said. 
 
 Who is Kim Jong Un? 
 
 Locklear said Kim Jong Un has adopted pages from the playbook used by his father, Kim Jong Il, but his approach differs in a significant way. Kim Jong Un's father, as well as his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, made sure they had ""off ramps"" that gave them a way to exit a confrontation, particularly if the U.S. and its allies were willing to offer concessions. Kim Jong Un, Locklear said, appears not to have given himself channels that would help him ratchet down the tensions. 
 
 The admiral described Kim Jong Un as ""an impetuous young leader (who) continues to focus on provocation rather than on his own people."" 
 
 The scope of Locklear's responsibilities as the top officer at Pacific Command extend beyond the Korean peninsula, and he told the committee that his command is closely watching the proliferation of submarines among countries including China and Vietnam. Locklear said there are an estimated 300 submarines being operated around the world, although he noted that no country there has an undersea force as capable as the United States'. 
 
 Both Russia and China are expected soon to deploy new ballistic missile submarines capable of threatening the United States, Locklear said. India is also expanding its submarine force, and Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and South Korea have launched, or soon will, modern submarines. ||||| SEOUL/WASHINGTON South Korea said on Wednesday there was a ""very high"" probability that North Korea, after weeks of threats of war, would test-launch a medium-range missile at any time as a show of strength. 
 
 Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said South Korea had asked China and Russia to intercede with the North to ease tension that has mounted since the U.N. Security Council imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea after its third nuclear arms test in February. 
 
 In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said North Korea was ""skating very close to a dangerous line"" with its threats and provocations, and warned the United States was prepared to respond to any moves by Pyongyang. 
 
 ""We have every capacity to deal with any action that North Korea would take, to protect this country and the interests of this country and our allies,"" Hagel told reporters at the Pentagon. 
 
 Most observers say Pyongyang has no intention of igniting a conflict that could bring its own destruction but warn of the risks of miscalculation on the highly-militarized Korean peninsula. 
 
 All was calm in the South Korean capital Seoul, long used to North Korean invective under its 30-year-old leader Kim Jong-un. Offices worked normally and customers crowded into city-centre cafes. 
 
 Seoul stocks edged up 0.77 percent from a four-and-a-half-month low hit earlier in the week, though trading was light with threats from the North still clouding the picture. The won currency gained 0.3 percent. 
 
 Other officials in Seoul said surveillance of North Korean activity had been enhanced. Missile transporters had been spotted in South Hamgyong province along North Korea's east coast - a possible site for a launch. 
 
 North Korea observes several anniversaries in the next few days and they could be pretexts for displays of military strength. These include the first anniversary of Kim's formal ascent to power, the 20th anniversary of rule by his father, Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011, and Monday's anniversary of the birth of the young Kim's grandfather, state founder Kim Il-Sung. 
 
 The near-daily threats to South Korea and the United States of recent weeks were muted in the North's state media on Wednesday, with the focus largely on the upcoming festivities. 
 
 State television showed mass gatherings, including women in traditional flowing robes, listening to addresses, laying flowers at monuments and taking part in a culinary competition. 
 
 The North's KCNA news agency said people were ""doing their best to decorate cities."" Another dispatch reported a ""production upsurge"" in the coal, steel, iron and timber industries, with figures showing a quarterly plan set by authorities had been ""overfulfilled."" 
 
 Admiral Samuel Locklear, the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific region, said on Tuesday the U.S. military believed North Korea had moved an unspecified number of Musudan missiles to its east coast. 
 
 The trajectory of the missile, if launched, is unclear as the North has failed to inform international bodies - as it did in previous instances - of the path it is expected to take. But it is unlikely to be aimed directly at the South. 
 
 The Musudan has a range of 3,500 km (2,100 miles) or more, according to South Korea, which would put Japan within range and may even threaten Guam, home to U.S. bases. South Korea can be reached by the North's short-range Scud missiles. 
 
 LAUNCH POSSIBLE ""AT ANY TIME"" 
 
 Foreign Minister Yun told a parliamentary hearing: ""According to intelligence obtained by our side and the U.S., the possibility of a missile launch by North Korea is very high."" 
 
 North Korea, he said, could launch a Musudan missile ""at any time from now."" 
 
 The U.S.-South Korea Combined Forces Command in Seoul raised its ""Watchcon 3"" status, a normal condition, by one level to boost monitoring and increase the number of intelligence staff, a senior military official told the South's Yonhap news agency. 
 
 Yonhap also reported that South Korea, which has not joined a U.S.-led global missile defense system, was planning to develop a system of its own. It quoted an unidentified senior military official as saying this would involve early warning radars, ship-to-air and land-based systems, to be used in conjunction with U.S. early warning satellites. 
 
 Patricia Lewis, research director at the London-based Chatham House think-tank, said that strictly on the basis of the North's vast conventional forces, caution was required. 
 
 ""The conventional military capabilities of North Korea are all too real and all too close to Seoul,"" she wrote in a paper. ""Any incursion could escalate involving the U.S. and Japan, China, perhaps Russia and others."" 
 
 The North has tested short-range Scud missiles. The longer-range Musudan and Nodong missiles are an unknown quantity. 
 
 ""If the missile was in defense of the homeland, I would certainly recommend that action (of intercepting it). And if it was defense of our allies, I would recommend that action,"" Locklear told a Senate hearing in Washington. 
 
 Pyongyang has threatened a nuclear strike on the United States - something it does not have the capacity to carry out - and ""war"" with ""puppet"" South Korea - threats that appear to be aimed at least in part at boosting internal support for Kim. 
 
 U.S. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to answer a question about how close he believed North Korea was to being able to miniaturize a nuclear weapon, a necessary step to being able to place one on a missile. He said that information was classified. 
 
 But Dempsey didn't rule out the possibility entirely and, in an apparent acknowledgement of the limits of U.S. intelligence on North Korea, said Washington had to prepare for the worst. 
 
 ""They have conducted two nuclear tests. They have conducted several successful ballistic missile launches,"" Dempsey said, sitting alongside Hagel, at a Pentagon news conference. 
 
 ""And in the absence of concrete evidence to the contrary, we have to assume the worst case, and that's why we're postured as we are today."" 
 
 MILITARY EXERCISES 
 
 The North is also angry about weeks of joint South Korean-U.S. military exercises. About 28,000 U.S. forces are permanently based in South Korea. 
 
 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visits Seoul this week. 
 
 On Tuesday, the North told foreigners in South Korea to leave to avoid being dragged into a ""thermonuclear war."" It previously warned diplomats in Pyongyang to prepare to leave. 
 
 The European Union told North Korea on Wednesday the increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula did not justify pulling out EU states' diplomats. 
 
 Yun said he was coordinating with China and Russia ""to make efforts to persuade North Korea to change its attitude."" 
 
 China is North Korea's sole major ally, although its influence over Pyongyang is open to question and Beijing has, in any event, endorsed the new sanctions. Moscow backed North Korea in Soviet times, though its influence has waned. 
 
 ""There is no disagreement with the United States over North Korea,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in London, where G8 foreign ministers are to hold talks. 
 
 ""One should not frighten anybody with military maneuvers,"" he was quoted as saying. ""There is a chance everything will calm down."" 
 
 A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a fresh appeal for restraint and said nothing about any possible effort to bring about a change in the North's policy. 
 
 In China's northeast region of Dandong, tour operators said they had been told by authorities to halt overland tourism to North Korea and some tourists were turned away. Other tours, including those involving air travel, were operating as usual. 
 
 (Additional reporting by Christine Kim and by Ben Blanchard in Beijing, Max Duncan in Dandong and David Alexander in Washington; Writing by Ron Popeski; Editing by Andrew Roche and Cynthia Osterman)","– North Korea threatening imminent thermonuclear war? Must be Wednesday. ""According to intelligence obtained by our side and the US, the possibility of a missile launch by North Korea is very high,"" South Korea's foreign minister said today, while CNN reports that a US official says Pyongyang could in fact be planning multiple strikes. South Korea is taking the threats seriously, increasing surveillance and engaging in diplomacy efforts via China and Russia. Japan has already responded by deploying missile interceptors, and the region's US commander has said it is also capable of thwarting a launch, reports CBS. ""I believe we have the ability to defend the homeland, Guam, Hawaii, and defend our allies,"" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Musudan missiles installed by Pyongyang are potentially within range of US military bases in Japan and Guam. But despite the very real probability that North Korea will launch a missile soon, everyday life goes on in Seoul, where citizens have long adjusted to its threats, reports Reuters. Likewise, signs of war are absent from the streets of Pyongyang, where soldiers continue to work on urban renewal projects and there hasn't been an air raid drill in months, the AP reports.","<pad> Yun Byung-se said the prospect of a North Korean missile launch is ""considerably high,"" and that the launch could take place at any time.</s>",0.14634146091612138,0.018181816167355595,0.14634146091612138
208,"Lynsi Torres, the 30-year-old owner and president of In-N-Out Burger, is one of the youngest female billionaires on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index. 
 
 How did that happen? 
 
 She inherited the fast food chain after a series of deaths in the family, Seth Lubove at Bloomberg News reported. 
 
 In-N-Out was founded by her grandparents, Harry and Esther Snyder. Harry died in 1976 and one of his sons, Rich, took over. Rich died in a plane crash when he was 41, and Torres' father, Harry Guy Snyder, took over in 1993. Guy died in 1999 of a prescription drug overdose at the age of 49. Esther, Torres' grandmother, controlled In-N-Out until 2006, when she died at 86. 
 
 That left Torres as the only heir to In-N-Out. She currently has half ownership through a trust, but will get the entire company upon turning 35. 
 
 Torres doesn't have a college degree and is on her third marriage. Oh, and as Gawker's Hamilton Nolan noted, she's also a competitive drag racer. 
 
 She's pretty mysterious, too. Apparently, even people in the restaurant industry don't know much about her. 
 
 “I have no clue about her,” restaurant consultant Janet Lowder told Bloomberg. “I was even surprised there was a granddaughter.” 
 
 We do know that she owns a $17.4 million, 16,600-square-foot mansion in Bradbury, California. It has seven bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, and a whole bunch of amenities. ||||| Join us on Facebook Like us and you'll find top breaking news in your Facebook newsfeed.

It's an odd assemblage, linked only by the ill-fated and often unlikable members of the Snyder clan, founders of a string of West Coast hamburger restaurants known as In-N-Out Burger. And since Ms. Perman's overcooked book means to celebrate the Snyders and their company as ""a testament to old-fashioned values . . . reminiscent of a simpler time when people, loyalty, and a freshly-made juicy hamburger meant something,"" she's in a bit of a pickle. 
 
 ""Harry Snyder's dream was a modest one,"" Ms. Perman writes, by way of introduction. ""He was going to start his own little food business -- a hamburger stand."" And we're off. The year is 1948. The place, Baldwin Park, 17 miles east of Los Angeles. Our budding mogul is a 35-year-old first-generation American, a veteran and a newlywed. Harry and Esther gin up $5,000, buy a small lot fronting what is soon to be a major artery between L.A. and Palm Springs, and begin selling burgers for a quarter and soft drinks for a dime. 
 
 Good timing. Tender shoots of fresh highway crisscross California, cars are plentiful and cheap, and the family meal has already begun its migration from dinner table to dashboard. Harry sticks a microphone and speaker on a pole, strings a wire from the lot to the grill, and rides the car-hop wave. By the book's end, In-N-Out is pulling down $450 million in annual sales. We're getting ahead of the story, though. 
 
 Ms. Perman is a business writer, most recently at BusinessWeek, and ""In-N-Out Burger"" is published by Collins Business. Thus one cracks the book expecting a business lesson or two. And voilà: Harry Snyder's formula for success, we learn, ""was not based on some fancy management methodology""; it was ""based on three simple words: 'Quality, Cleanliness, and Service.' "" This is relayed on page 44. If you've bought the book seeking business wisdom, you can stop reading. You're done. 
 
 In-N-Out Burger 
 
 By Stacy Perman 
 
 (Collins Business, 345 pages, $24.99) 
 
 Ah, but our tale is not, though it unfolds in a way that Ms. Perman cannot soon control. She wants us to admire the chain and its plucky founder, à la Sam Walton, but the company benefits mostly from blind luck, and her protagonist is a bit of a martinet. Fearful of debt, Harry Snyder expands on the pay-as-you-go plan. As it happens, such flintiness serves the company well. It never overreaches, never over-extends. While Ray Kroc (McDonald's) and Carl Karcher (Carl's Jr.) attach franchise-fueled booster rockets to their fast-food businesses, Ma and Pa Snyder take it slow and steady, one or two million in sales at a time. The relative scarcity of their burgers only adds to the appeal, and the chain gains a mystique. 
 
 Cut to 1976. McDonald's boasts 4,000 restaurants; Harry has only 18, but things are going pretty well. Then, rather abruptly, he dies. Passing over the elder Snyder son, Guy, Esther and the board install 24-year-old, portly, dyslexic Rich Snyder as president. ""The upending of primogeniture created a conflict between the two brothers whose relationship was already exacerbated by personality clashes,"" Ms. Perman writes. ""It had the emotional intensity of the biblical story of Jacob and Esau without, of course, the bloodlust or deceit."" Um, sure. 
 
 Rich's reign lasts 74 pages. Not much of a tinkerer, he leaves untouched most of his father's less-is-more business practices, except for an unconsummated flirtation with a chicken sandwich. Learning of the plan, Guy went ""ballistic,"" according to a friend. ""He was not going to go for that at all."" 
 
 Crisis averted, Rich devotes his energy to buffing his conservative bona fides. He gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party and adds ""The Best Enterprise is a Free Enterprise 'God Bless America' "" to In-N-Out stationery. He prints Bible verses on the chain's soda cups and signs off on In-N-Out radio spots that ask listeners to let Jesus into their lives. Confronted with the inevitable complaints, Rich snaps: ""Well, that's too bad. This is God's company, not mine."" Soon he's supping at the White House, eating roast loin of veal with Dan Quayle. He marries a woman 14 years his junior, builds a mansion and, then, rather abruptly, dies in a plane crash. At the funeral, hamburgers are served. 
 
 It's now 1993. Enter Guy Snyder. Awkward, also portly, and prone to substance abuse, he is not an ideal chief executive for a company now generating $133 million in sales. Before long Guy is shooting heroin, sending a company executive into Mexico to smuggle drugs, and getting busted (on Christmas Day) with a briefcase stuffed with pot, Valium, Klonopin, a 9mm Glock, a switchblade and $27,475 in cash. Poor Ms. Perman does her darnedest to put a sunny spin on things. ""It was due in no small part to the talented and loyal executive team that In-N-Out Burger remained on a stable and successful course."" No doubt. 
 
 We're running of out time, so let me speed things up. Rather abruptly, Guy dies in 1999 of a drug-related heart attack, precipitating an ugly tussle for control of the burger chain between one of Guy's ex-wives, 79-year-old Esther, and one of those talented and loyal In-N-Out executives. Charges fly over the misuse of corporate funds and sweetheart deals. Lawsuits get filed. At one point, Esther is made a prisoner in her home, with phone calls and visitors screened by her ex-daughter-in-law. 
 
 Then, rather abruptly, Esther dies in 2006, leaving Guy's 24-year-old daughter to inherit the company (now worth almost half a billion dollars). With only a high-school education and an affinity for joining off-beat Christian sects, Lynsi Martinez ""lacks sufficient personal maturity, experience, and skill necessary to successfully run In-N-Out,"" or so testifies an In-N-Out board member. No matter, as Ms. Perman writes: ""The dynasty had been preserved."" 
 
 So, what to make of all this? Ms. Perman repeatedly tells us that the story of this ""family-owned, fiercely independent chain"" is in fact simply the story of America, writ small. Alas, she may be right. 
 
 Mr. Tayman is the author of ""The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai."" 
 
 Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page A13 ||||| Lunchtime at the flagship In-N-Out Burger restaurant in Baldwin Park, California, is a study in efficiency. As the order line swells, smiling workers swoop in to operate empty cash registers. Another staffer cleans tables, asking customers if they’re enjoying their hamburger. Outside, a woman armed with a hand-held ordering machine speeds up the drive-through line. 
 
 Such service has helped In-N-Out create a rabid fan base -- and make Lynsi Torres, the chain’s 30-year-old owner and president, one of the youngest female billionaires on Earth. New store openings often resemble product releases from Apple Inc. (AAPL), with customers lined up hours in advance. City officials plead with the Irvine, California-based company to open restaurants in their municipalities. 
 
 “They have done a fantastic job of building and maintaining a kind of cult following,” said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of Chicago-based food industry research firm Technomic Inc. “Someone would love to buy them.” 
 
 That someone includes billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who told a group of visiting business students in 2005 that he’d like to own the chain, according to an account of the meeting on the UCLA Anderson School of Management website.

 The thrice-married Torres has watched her family expand In- N-Out from a single drive-through hamburger stand founded in 1948 in Baldwin Park by her grandparents, Harry and Esther Snyder, into a fast-food empire worth more than $1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 
 
 Biblical Citations 
 
 Famous for its Double-Double cheeseburgers, fresh ingredients and discreet biblical citations on its cups and food wrappers, In-N-Out has almost 280 units in five states. The closely held company had sales of about $625 million in 2012, after applying a five-year compound annual growth rate of 4.6 percent to industry trade magazine Nation’s Restaurant News’s 2011 sales estimate of $596 million. 
 
 In-N-Out is valued at about $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg ranking, based on the average price-to-earnings, enterprise value-to-sales and enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples of five publicly traded peers: Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM), Jack in the Box Inc., Wendy’s Co. (WEN), Sonic Corp. (SONC) and McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) Enterprise value is defined as market capitalization plus total debt minus cash. 
 
 One private equity executive who invests in the food and restaurant industry said the operation could be valued at more than $2 billion, based on its productivity per unit, profitability and potential for expansion. The person asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak about his company’s potential investments.

 Plane Crash 
 
 “In-N-Out Burger is a private company and this valuation of the company is nothing more than speculation based on estimates from people with no knowledge of In-N-Out’s financials, which are and always have been private,” Carl Van Fleet, the company’s vice president of planning and development, said in an e-mailed statement. 
 
 Torres, who has never appeared on an international wealth ranking and declined to comment for this article, came to control In-N-Out after several family deaths. When her grandfather Harry died in 1976, his second son, Rich, took over as company president and expanded the chain to 93 restaurants from 18. 
 
 Torres’s father, Harry Guy Snyder, became chief executive following Rich’s 1993 death in a plane crash at age 41. The chain expanded to 140 locations under Guy, who inherited his father’s passion for drag racing. 
 
 Ford Cobra 
 
 When he died of a prescription drug overdose at age 49 in 1999, Snyder’s estate included 27 cars and other vehicles, including a 1965 Ford Cobra and a pair of 1960’s-era Dodge Dart muscle cars, according to his will. 
 
 Torres’s grandmother Esther -- Harry’s widow -- maintained control of the company until her death in 2006 at age 86. When she died, Torres was the sole family heir. She now controls the company through a trust that gave her half ownership when she turned 30 last year, and will give her full control when she turns 35. The company has no other owners, according to an Arizona state corporation commission filing. 
 
 Few in the restaurant industry have met or know much about the hamburger heiress. 
 
 “I have no clue about her,” said Janet Lowder, a Rancho Palos Verdes, California, restaurant consultant, who said she was one of the few people to extract the company’s internal finances from Esther Snyder in the 1980’s for industry-wide surveys. “I was even surprised there was a granddaughter.” 
 
 Limited Menu 
 
 Technomic’s Goldin said the lack of visibility extends to management. 
 
 “I’ve been in the industry a long time, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen any of their people at an industry meeting,” he said. “They’re very quiet. That’s their culture.” 
 
 Torres has little formal management training and no college degree. The company was structured to carry on after the demise of its founders, according to a 2003 Harvard Business School case study. In-N-Out has never franchised to outside operators, the Harvard researchers said, giving up a low-cost revenue stream in exchange for maintaining quality control. 
 
 In a 2005 article in the Harvard Business Review, Boston- based Bain & Co. consultants Mark Gottfredson and Keith Aspinall attributed the company’s estimated 20 percent profit margins at the time to the simplicity of its limited menu. Contrast that with competitors such as Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s and Miami-based Burger King Worldwide Inc. (BKW), which regularly change their food offerings. 
 
 Over-sized Tires 
 
 “Other chains seem to change positions as often as they change their underwear,” said Bob Sandelman, chief executive officer of San Clemente, California-based food industry researcher Sandelman & Associates. 
 
 Butchers carve fresh beef chuck delivered daily to the company’s distribution facility in Baldwin Park, where hamburger patties leave for restaurants on 18-wheeled refrigerated trucks outfitted with over-sized tires so the In-N-Out logo can be better seen on the highway. The company only expands as far as its trucks can travel in a day, either from the Baldwin Park complex or a newer facility in Dallas, the only two places where the company makes hamburger patties. 
 
 ‘Calculated Growth’ 
 
 In-N-Out expanded to Texas in 2011, after building a warehouse and the patty facility. There are now 16 units in the state. Conrad Lyon, a Los Angeles-based senior restaurants analyst for B. Riley Caris, said additional expansion will continue to be gradual. 
 
 “I would expect slow, calculated growth,” he said in a phone interview. “To outsiders the company’s growth out West likely appears sluggish. However, it was management carefully leveraging its brand, real estate and distribution. As a private company-owned system, In-N-Out has the luxury of calling the shots to replicate its success without succumbing to potentially detrimental outside influences.” 
 
 The company’s pace of expansion was one of the issues at stake in an exchange of lawsuits in 2006 between Torres, In-N- Out executives and Richard Boyd, the company’s former vice president of real estate and development. Boyd was one of two trustees overseeing the trust that controls the company’s stock on behalf of Torres. 
 
 Complaints, Allegations 
 
 Among other allegations filed in California state court in Los Angeles, Boyd claimed Torres and Mark Taylor -- her brother- in-law from a half-sister -- conspired to remove Esther Snyder from the company to gain control of In-N-Out. He filed a separate petition with the probate court seeking to prevent Torres from removing him as a trustee. 
 
 Torres denied the allegations in both a formal answer to Boyd’s complaint and a 2006 letter to the editor published in the Los Angeles Times, in which she said she only had “minimal involvement” in the company’s business decisions, and didn’t favor rapid expansion. 
 
 The company in turn filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Boyd, alleging fraud and embezzlement in connection to Boyd’s relationship to one of In-N-Out’s outside construction firms. Boyd’s lawyer, Philip Heller of Fagelbaum & Heller LLP in Los Angeles, said all the litigation was dismissed following a confidential settlement. Boyd resigned from the company and the trust. 
 
 “They were all in the end amicably resolved,” Heller said. 
 
 16 Bathrooms 
 
 Since then, Torres has refused most interview requests, even by author Stacy Perman, who wrote a 352-page book about In- N-Out in 2009. Torres asked to set up a meeting with the author after the book’s publication, but it never occurred, Perman wrote in an afterword to the 2010 paperback edition. 
 
 Torres popped up in real-estate blogs in September, after buying a $17.4 million, 16,600-square-foot mansion in the wealthy enclave of Bradbury, California, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. A Realtor.com listing for the house described it as having seven bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, a pool, a tennis court and other amenities. 
 
 Torres is one of almost 90 hidden billionaires discovered by Bloomberg News since the debut of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index in March 2012. Among them: Dirce Camargo, the richest woman in Brazil, and Elaine Marshall, the fourth-richest woman in America. 
 
 Like Camargo and Marshall, Torres maintains a low profile. Her most visible presence has been on the drag strip. She competes in the National Hot Rod Association’s Super Gas and Top Sportsman Division 7 categories, alternating between a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda and a 1984 Chevrolet Camaro, according to NHRA results. Her third husband, Val Torres Jr., is also a race- car driver. 
 
 ‘Open Question’ 
 
 She also inherited her Uncle Rich’s interest in religion, funding a non-profit organization called Healing Hearts & Nations that proselytizes in Africa, according to a 2010 Form 990 foundation filing that lists Torres as the chief financial officer. Former In-N-Out executive Boyd alleged in his 2006 cross-complaint against the company that Torres attempted to fire him because he was not a “man of God,” and because he didn’t attend prayer meetings at her home. She denied Boyd’s claims in the company’s answer. 
 
 Whether the mother of twins will maintain ownership in the chain after she gains full control in five years is uncertain, said John Gordon, founder of San Diego-based restaurant consultant Pacific Management Consulting Group. 
 
 “It’s an open question whether she may have different feelings later,” said Gordon. “Like most kids, or second or third generations of a very wealthy family, I don’t know that she has restaurant blood in her veins, or if she’s a trust fund baby.”

209,"Italian author, poet and translator Erri De Luca has added another accolade to his glittering career – although this may be one he would prefer to have avoided. The winner of the 2013 European Prize for Literature, hailed as “writer of the decade” by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in 2009, has won the 24th annual Literary Review Bad sex award for a passage in his novel The Day Before Happiness. 
 
 Bad sex award 2016: the contenders in quotes Read more 
 
 De Luca’s win was announced at a ceremony at the appropriately named In and Out club in London on Wednesday night. The excerpt that swayed the judges involved the Neapolitan orphan protagonist and a mysterious woman he has watched from afar. 
 
 He writes: “My prick was a plank stuck to her stomach. With a swerve of her hips, she turned me over and I was on top of her. She opened her legs, pulled up her dress and, holding my hips over her, pushed my prick against her opening. I was her plaything, which she moved around. Our sexes were ready, poised in expectation, barely touching each other: ballet dancers hovering en pointe.” 
 
 De Luca was unable to attend and his publisher at Allen Lane accepted the prize on his behalf. 
 
 The book beat stiff competition from a shortlist that included former Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis for a passage in her bestselling debut The Butchers’ Hook. It likened sex to hanging out wet washing. Ethan Canin was picked for an episode in A Doubter’s Almanac where pneumatic lovers enjoy sex “like a brisk tennis game or a summer track meet, something performed in daylight between competitors. The cheap mattress bounced.” 
 
 In Men Like Air, Tom Connolly presented the eye-watering revelation that “often she cooked exotic meals and put chillies or spices in her mouth while preparing the food and sucked him while the food cooked and then told him to fuck her while his manhood was burning rock-hard with fire.” Leave Me by Gayle Forman, and The Tobacconist by Robert Seethaler were also in contention for this year’s prize. 
 
 Despite the sniggers that greet the annual announcement, the Bad sex award was established in 1993 to raise the tone rather than lower it. The then-editor of the Literary Review, Auberon Waugh, hoped the prize would “draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction”. Since then it has become the one prize literary authors hope to avoid. 
 
 Last year, the singer Morrissey won for a passage in his debut novel List of the Lost, in which the protagonists “sexually violent rotation” was rendered more laughable by the description: “Eliza’s breasts barrel-rolled across Ezra’s howling mouth and the pained frenzy of his bulbous salutation extenuating his excitement as it whacked and smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza’s body except for the otherwise central zone.” 
 
 However, De Luca joins an illustrious group of past recipients. As well as Morrissey, bad sex writing by the likes of Melvyn Bragg, Sebastian Faulks, Norman Mailer and Ben Okri has also received the unwelcome accolade. ||||| Here is Francesca Wade's review of The Day Before Happiness, originally published in The Telegraph with the headline: ‘You’re pollen. Obey me, for I am the wind’ 
 
 The atmosphere of Fifties Naples has captured the imagination of millions via Elena Ferrante’s luminous quartet of novels about two girls growing up in a poor neighbourhood, published in English to feverish acclaim over the past few years. Her compatriot Erri de Luca – author of over 50 books, many outselling Ferrante in Italian – traverses similar terrain in this 2009 novel, following a young orphan’s life in a Neapolitan apartment block “full of walled-up trapdoors, secret passageways, crimes and passions”. 
 
 Unlike Ferrante’s epic saga, De Luca’s novel – his first to be translated into English – is concise and elliptical. It starts in our unnamed narrator’s childhood, but swiftly jumps to a heady period when he is 17. Nicknamed “the monkey” for his agile retrieval of stray footballs, the watchful boy lives alone, cared for by the porter Don Gaetano, a sage-like figure who claims he can read people’s thoughts. Over games of cards, Don Gaetano regales the orphan with tales of Second World War resistance: how he tried to sustain a Jewish man who spent the summer of 1943 hiding in a storeroom while above tanks ploughed through shops and Jews were sold to the police. Undetonated bombs, the boy learns, still stud Naples, subterranean relics of a dark past. 
 
 Wartime is richly evoked, but the other strand of the plot, a love story, is less affecting. As a child, the boy was fascinated by a girl he had seen only through a third-floor window. After a decade, she returns to the building. Their ensuing passion is ripe with overblown dialogue (“ ‘Anna, an eternity has passed.’ ‘It’s over. Time begins now, and will last only moments.’ ” “ ‘Can I kiss you?’ ‘No. You’re pollen. Obey me, for I am the wind.’ ”). Anna is mad, it turns out, which explains her mysterious disappearance; beyond that, her condition is never properly explored. Naples itself – simmering with rage and corruption – is the most memorable character in this slightly disjointed novel.

 The 9-year-old victim was with her mother at that home, where the mother was hanging out with a friend she met while incarcerated in jail. As the 9-year-old girl slept on the couch, her mother and that friend agreed to go into the garage and get high on methamphetamine. 
 
 When the mother returned, her daughter was on the couch but her clothes were in disarray and she seemed upset and wanted to go home. The next day, the girl reported that four men inside the home had taken her into a bedroom before taking turns raping her and then sodomizing her. 
 
 The girl reported that while one of the men was raping her, he told her he would kill her if she ever told anyone about what was happening. 
 
 The girl's mother notified police, who responded to the home. One of the four alleged rapists was identified by the victim from a photograph, and 36-year-old Larson James RonDeau was taken into custody.

211,"The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday advanced GOP legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare on a party line vote, moving the process forward even as the bill faces headwinds. 
 
 Republican leaders are pushing forward with the process on a fast timetable, even as many conservatives strongly object to the bill, known as the American Health Care Act, and centrists harbor their own reservations. 
 
 The committee markup lasted over 16 hours, stretching until after 4 a.m. Thursday before the measure was approved, 23-16. Republicans blamed Democrats for purposely dragging the process out with a range of amendments. The measure now goes to the House Budget Committee, with plans for a vote in the full House within weeks.

 Democrats said Republicans were wrongly advancing the bill in the middle of the night. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, meanwhile, was still going, working through the night. 
 
 “Here were are at almost 2 o’clock in the morning taking a vote when the American people have gone to sleep,” said Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the Ways and Means Committee’s top Democrat. 
 
 Democrats were generally more vocal, denouncing a range of measures in the bill, while Republicans voted down amendment after amendment. 
 
 The committee called a markup without a score from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), meaning lawmakers voted without an analysis of how much the bill will cost or how many people would lose coverage. 
 
 Democrats argued that Republicans wanted to move forward without a score because it would cast a bad light on their healthcare plan. 
 
 ""You’re fearful the CBO will provide answers to questions that you don’t like,"" said Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.).

 ""We expect CBO to have a thoughtful, thorough, comprehensive score to us before this recommendation goes to the Budget Committee, comes to the House floor,"" he said. 
 
 Republicans also pushed aside a Democratic amendment aimed at highlighting the ""Trump promise"" that everyone would have health insurance under a GOP plan. 
 
 The amendment from Rep. Earl Blumenauer Earl BlumenauerSessions' war on marijuana a handout for illegal operators Fox's Wallace: 'It's a mistake' for Dems to boycott State of the Union WHIP LIST: Dems boycotting Trump’s State of the Union MORE (D-Ore.) would have prevented the GOP ObamaCare replacement bill from taking effect until the CBO ensured that the bill would provide health insurance for ""all taxpayers and their dependents."" 
 
 The amendment was an attempt to draw attention to President Trump's comment in January to The Washington Post that a GOP plan should provide ""insurance for everybody."" 
 
 Republicans acknowledge that their bill will cover fewer people than ObamaCare but say that it is not trying to compete with the health law, which includes a mandate requiring coverage. 
 
 Republicans sidelined the amendment on parliamentary grounds, saying that it was not germane, as they did with a range of other Democratic amendments. Blumenauer said lawmakers should ""give the American people the 'Trump guarantee.'"" 
 
 Later, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) held up Trump’s quotation on a poster. 
 
 Republicans blamed Democrats for dragging out the process with off-topic amendments. 
 
 Democrats denounced Republicans for repealing a pair of ObamaCare taxes on high-income people. Levin asked “how this isn’t a boondoggle for the very wealthy while really assaulting the interests of typical middle class families.” 
 
 Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) defended the repeal of one of the taxes, on investment income. “If investment is good, then why are we raising taxes on investment?” he said. 
 
 Democrats noted that the repeal of the higher Medicare taxes on high earners is projected to reduce the expected solvency of the Medicare trust fund by three years. 
 
 More broadly, Brady praised repealing all of the ObamaCare taxes. “Do you want all these taxes on people, or do you want affordable healthcare?” he said. 
 
 Levin also criticized the new Republican tax credit for failing to give enough help to low-income people, citing a Kaiser Family Foundation study that found the new credit would provide an average of 36 percent less help than the assistance under ObamaCare. 
 
 Democrats offered a range of other amendments, including to prevent enactment of the bill if it was found to raise out of pocket health costs and to allow states to choose to keep ObamaCare, among other issues. 
 
 Doggett unsuccessfully offered a motion to delay the Ways and Means markup until next week, arguing that the bill is a ""legislative surprise package"" released just two days before the committee vote. 
 
 ""If you have nothing to hide, a week will not impair your effort,"" he said. ||||| Now that Republicans have rolled out their legislative plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican congressional leaders have begun to sell the bill to build the support required for its passage.

 House of Representatives: 216 
 
 In the House of Representatives, Republicans must amass a simple majority to pass the legislation. While that threshold is typically 218 ayes when all House seats are filled, that number has decreased to 216 because of five vacancies. It could change if there are additional resignations or if any of the vacancies are filled through special elections before a vote. 
 
 The magic number: 21 
 
 Since there are currently 237 Republicans in the House and none of the 193 Democrats are expected to vote in support of the GOP’s plan, Ryan can afford to lose up to 21 of his Republican colleagues before granting concessions to any conservatives whose concerns have inspired them to withhold their support. A 238th Republican could be added if new CIA Director Mike Pompeo's former Kansas district remains in GOP control after its April 11 special election, in which case the magic number would become 22. 
 
 While it currently would take only 21 House Republicans to kill the bill or force leadership into changes and several are already pressing leadership to make additional changes, Ryan predicted the bill will ultimately pass. 
 
 “I have no doubt we’ll pass this, because we're going to keep our promises,” Ryan told reporters on Tuesday, adding that every congressional Republican as well as President Trump “made a promise to the American people and the promise we made to the American people is we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.” 
 
 Senate: 50 
 
 In the Senate, no Democrats or independents are expected to vote in favor of the GOP’s plan. But Republicans are expected to vote on the plan under a procedural mechanism known as budget reconciliation, which also requires only a simple majority for passage and bars filibustering. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has the luxury of a Republican White House, where Vice President Mike Pence’s role as president of the Senate affords him the exclusive right to break tie votes in the upper chamber. 
 
 The magic number: 2 
 
 With 52 Senate Republicans, if three or more conservatives vote against the bill, Pence won’t have a chance to cast a tie-breaking vote. 
 
 Already, Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee have expressed their strong opposition to the current state of the bill, placing its success in jeopardy. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also have deep concerns about the legislation. ||||| Story highlights The Prevention and Public Health Fund was created under the Affordable Care Act 
 
 Republican critics say it is a ""slush fund"" that has been spent on Zumba classes and massage sessions 
 
 Washington (CNN) Public health advocates are warning lawmakers the GOP plan to repeal Obamacare will eliminate nearly $1 billion in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding used for programs like preventing disease outbreaks and childhood lead poisoning. 
 
 But Republican critics say the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which amounts to 12% of CDC's budget, is a ""slush fund"" that has been spent on Zumba classes and massage sessions. Their proposal includes a new fund that they say provides states ""broad flexibility"" to address local health concerns. 
 
 The Republican bill would eliminate the fund, created under the Affordable Care Act, which has grown from a small slice of the CDC budget to providing $931 million last year. 
 
 It funds heart disease and stroke prevention, immunization, lead poisoning prevention and diabetes prevention, mostly through grants to states and local programs, according to the CDC. 
 
 CDC's website says losing this funding would cripple officials' ability to detect, prevent and respond to health threats including pandemic flu.

 The opposition is also a powerful reminder of how many past efforts to overhaul the American health care system failed because of resistance by major interest groups. Winning the support of the health care and insurance industries allowed the Obama administration in 2010 to push through the most significant health care legislation since President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society. 
 
 Within a few months after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, his administration had lined up support from health care providers, insurers, consumers and pharmaceutical makers by offering a grand bargain: The health bill would include a requirement that most Americans have health insurance, providing millions of new customers through the law’s often substantial premium subsidies and its option for states to expand Medicaid. In exchange, hospitals would have to accept spending cuts and the health care industry would have to accept new taxes to pay for the legislation. 
 
 The Obama White House dedicated enormous effort to win pledges of support before Democrats even put out a bill — an effort not replicated by the Trump White House or Republican leaders in Congress. 
 
 But the Affordable Care Act also created an array of taxes that the Republicans now hope to wipe away, helping them win the support of groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Tax Reform, led by the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist. 
 
 The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation issued estimates this week showing how much revenue the government could lose starting in 2018 under the Republican bill, which the party has called the American Health Care Act, as a result of repealing taxes on drug makers (nearly $25 billion over 10 years), insurers (nearly $145 billion), makers of medical devices (nearly $20 billion), and high-income households (more than $270 billion from taxes on earned income and investment income). 
 
 “The American Health Care Act repeals the medical device tax, which will result in greater investments in medical cures, lower health care costs and more high-tech manufacturing jobs in communities across the United States,” trumpeted the Medical Device Manufacturers Association.","– The GOP's replacement plan for ObamaCare isn't getting a universal thumbs-up, but it cleared one of its first hurdles early Thursday, the Hill reports. In a session that lasted more than 16 hours and went past 4am, the House Ways and Means Committee approved the measure in a 23-16 vote, with Republicans shooting down ""off-topic"" amendments proposed by Democrats, who in turn accused Republicans of trying to push the bill through while people were asleep and without a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the measure. ""You're fearful the CBO will provide answers to questions that you don't like,"" such as bill costs or revealing who'd lose coverage, Michigan Rep. Sandy Levin said. One of the many bones of contention in the bill: a proposal to cut nearly $1 billion in CDC funding, per CNN. Committee Chair Kevin Brady said a ""thoughtful, thorough comprehensive score"" was expected before the bill ends up with the House Budget Committee, the next step in advancing the bill. Also pushing back on the controversial measure: groups representing retirees, hospitals, and medical professionals, the New York Times reports. The AARP and American Medical Association spurned the bill Tuesday, and on Wednesday, the American Nurses Association and lobbyist groups for hospitals and other health systems joined in, with the latter also mentioning the CBO's absence as an issue.

 Authorities have seized 276 small dogs from a New Jersey home in what one official described as ""the worst hoarding situation"" they had seen in Monmouth County. 
 
 The house raised suspicions from an Associated Humane Society official as he investigated a report of a dog on the loose by Bennett Road in Howell on Thursday, authorities said. He was knocking on doors in the area when he came across the home, where a foul odor was emanating. 
 
 No one answered the door there, but he heard dogs barking inside and notified SPCA. Officers responded and investigated, then launched the rescue operation Friday. 
 
 Inside the home, officers found more than 270 Chihuahuas, Yorkies, pugs and mixed-breeds dogs inside. 
 
 Over 200 Puppies Seized from NJ Home 
 
 Authorities have seized more than 200 small dogs from a Monmouth County home, calling it ""the worst hoarding situation"" they had seen in the county. Brian Thompson reports. (Published Friday, June 3, 2016) 
 
 Many were sitting on bookshelves. One shelf was specially built near the ceiling of the living room, ""like a hamster cage for dogs,"" according to Tierney Park, a Monmouth Sheriff's deputy. ""They have steps that go up to the shelf and there were dogs looking down and barking."" 
 
 There were others living under beds and even between walls. Many appeared petrified as they were brought out, having never been exposed to the outdoors. 
 
 ""They're just undersocialized, fearful,"" said Heather Cammisa of St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center, who was assisting in the rescue. ""They haven't been around a lot of people."" 
 
 Despite that, most of the dogs were fairly well taken care of, according to Ross Licitra, chief of the Monmouth County SPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division. 
 
 The owners, Charlene and Joseph Handrick, are expected to face charges. One rescuer described Charlene as distraught and in tears, calling the dogs ""my family."" 
 
 Neighbor Suzanne DeGrande said she hadn't seen Charlene Handrick outside of the home in about five years. 
 
 ""I would knock on her door and say, 'Charlene, open the door, you have a dog loose,' and she would never open the door,"" she said. 
 
 Another neighbor, Janine Prochnow, said her son used to play with Charlene's son. 
 
 ""He would come to our house. My son reminded me today we were never allowed into their house,"" she said. 
 
 The Handricks declined to speak with NBC 4 New York outside their home. 
 
 The homeowners had told the SPCA and the Associated Humane Society there were about 80 dogs inside. But rescuers ultimately pulled out 276 dogs by Thursday night. 
 
 Rescuers vaccinated about 100 dogs as they were brought out. One dog gave birth to three puppies during the rescue, and an estimated 20 others were obviously pregnant.

 HOWELL – More than 200 dogs -- including at least one giving birth -- were rescued from deplorable conditions inside a bi-level home in what authorities are calling ""an extreme hoarding situation,"" authorities said. 
 
 ""Most of these dogs have never seen the outside of their house before,"" said Ross Licitra, chief law enforcement officer for the Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. In all, 276 dogs were found inside the 1880-square-foot Bennett Road home, officials said. Many were located on book shelves and makeshift platforms; some were even inside the walls. 
 
 UPDATE: Howell dogs doing well; charges against couple coming 
 
 ""This is actually the worst hoarding case that we've ever experienced ever here in the history of Monmouth County,"" he said. 
 
 He said most of the animals were in ""fair"" condition and authorities didn't find any dead dogs. However, some of the animals were taken to get emergency veterinary care; few of the dogs received oxygen at the scene. 
 
 Licitra stressed the residents of the home on Bennett Road, Charlene and Joseph Hendricks, were cooperating with authorities. The couple told authorities that they started three years ago with eight dogs. The dogs reproduced from there. 
 
 ""They're just not stopping it,"" he said. ""I think it's just completely uncontrolled."" 
 
 As authorities were packing up and leaving, a weary-looking Joseph and Charlene Hendricks emerged from the house and walked down the driveway. When approached by an Asbury Park Press reporter, Joseph Hendricks asked, ""Could you trim it down and not give us so much attention? We're not bad people."" 
 
 When asked if the couple wanted to tell their story, Joseph Hendricks said: ""Not much to tell at this point in time. I'm exhausted, I can't even think."" 
 
 When asked to explain how this happened, Hendricks replied, ""It's more than you think."" 
 
 With that, the couple returned to the house. 
 
 WATCH: Dog-fighting broken up in Asbury, cops say 
 
 Earlier in the day, acting Monmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni responded to the scene, and said criminal charges would hinge on the condition of the dogs. Dead or extremely malnourished dogs could warrant indictable offenses. The situation may only warrant a municipal court disorderly persons charge or possibly no charges at all. 
 
 ""It really depends on the facts and circumstances,"" he said. 
 
 Officials from the SPCA, Associated Humane Society of Tinton Falls, St. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Center, township police, and the county sheriff's office, health department and hazmat team responded to the house on Bennett Road, Licitra said. Authorities set up a triage area to care for and vaccinate the dogs before they were taken to shelters. They were able to vaccinate about 80 dogs at the scene before they ran out of supplies.

 Dozens of workers in hazmat suits pulled out dozens of dogs, including handfuls of puppies, of several different breeds, including pugs, chihuahuas and Yorkshire terriers. 
 
 As workers opened the front door to re-enter the house to remove more dogs, barking could be heard from inside. Some of the hazmat workers put on ventilators and air tanks, similar to what firefighters wear, before entering the house. Urine and feces were on the floor, and holes were torn through walls. A foul odor permeated the air. 
 
 Sheriff Shaun Golden said firefighters were using thermal imaging equipment to search for animals in cracks or crevices in the home. 
 
 ""It’s a huge undertaking,"" Licitra said of the effort to remove the animals. ""Everybody is trying to get this under control.""

 The situation was discovered about 6 p.m. Thursday after an animal control officer was called to the location to chase down a dog that got loose, the chief said. The officer, with the Associated Humane Society, suspected more was going on, eventually made contact with the owners of the house and then contacted the SPCA, Licitra said. 
 
 ""They called us, and this is what we’ve discovered,"" he said. 
 
 Some rescuers suffered minor injuries: cuts, bruises, respiratory issues, and heat exhaustion. They were treated at the scene.

 Sixty-eight assorted animals left to die in what SPCA officials described as ""a maggot-infested tomb,'' when former Toms River police dispatcher Matthew Teymant and his wife, Amanda, fell behind on the mortgage on their Barnegat home and moved out in 2008. Matthew Teymant, then 30, pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in 2009, was placed on probation for five years and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service. 
 
 On Wednesday, law-enforcement officers with the Monmouth County SPCA and federal agents rescued 17 pit bulls from a home in Asbury Park in what authorities said was an interstate, dog-fighting ring. The animals were seized from Mario Atkinson, 40, of New Street, Asbury Park, who was charged under a federal statute that makes it a felony to fight dogs or to possess them for dog-fighting. Authorities seized a total of 66 dogs, 44 of them from locations in New Jersey, in multi-state raids in the dog-fighting investigation on Wednesday.

214,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump returned to what he said was his preferred mode of public speaking during a campaign rally in Charlotte – without a teleprompter. ""I actually like my speech better without teleprompters,"" he said. (Reuters) 
 
 CHARLOTTE — For months, the teleprompters Donald Trump uses at campaign rallies have been a symbol of efforts to keep him “on message” — a sharp departure from the wild, freewheeling speeches that defined his candidacy during the GOP primary, but an acknowledgment of the difficult task of winning a general election. 
 
 On Friday, the Republican presidential nominee’s teleprompters broke down mid-rally. 
 
 “By the way,” he announced abruptly about 20 minutes into his speech, “these teleprompters haven’t been working for the last 20 minutes. And I actually like my speech better without teleprompters.” 
 
 It was a ready-made metaphor for the disorder afflicting his campaign, amid a weeks-long string of controversies that include several allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. Even as his advisers continue deliberating on how to respond, Trump has appeared resistant to much of their advice. He has instead signaled that he will move forward in the same way he ran his primary campaign: without their script, following his own instincts. 
 
 The scene here in Charlotte took a turn toward the literal on Friday night. Frustrated, Trump physically dismantled one of the teleprompters. Then he knocked the other one down. 
 
 He shared his thoughts on the matter: “You know, it’s very funny. I went through 17 professional politicians, top people, and I went without any teleprompters. Then all of a sudden, they said, ‘Well now you’re running the election, you need teleprompters.’ And I like tele — they’re fine, but it’s sort of cooler without it, right? Don’t you think? I like it better without it. And it’s a little strange when you see this place. I watch Hillary, she’s got the biggest pieces of glass. And sometimes they’re painted black on the other side, because you see better. And she always just reads off the teleprompter and it’s short and then she goes home and she goes to sleep,” he said. 
 
 When Trump’s speech began here in Charlotte, he was focused heavily on the leaked WikiLeaks emails that have embarrassed Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The emphasis on Clinton seemed like a deliberate departure from an earlier event in Greensboro, N.C., where he spent a large amount of time denying allegations of sexual assault and drew damaging headlines when he mocked the physical appearances of two women who had accused him. 
 
 Then, somewhere along the way, the prompters appear to have cut out. 
 
 The ensuing speech was difficult to follow. Trump moved between various topics without dwelling on any single one for an extended period of time. He talked rapidly about defense spending, creating jobs, the Iran nuclear deal and then his vanquished GOP rivals. At one point, he began to wonder aloud who pays for President Obama’s use of Air Force One when the president campaigns for Clinton. 
 
 To top it all off, the speakers on one side of the room then went out. 
 
 “I’ll tell you, whoever runs this place is not doing very well,” Trump quipped. “Great job, fellas. So now we don’t have to pay for this and now we don’t have to pay for that.” 
 
 He added: “Who the hell runs this place?” 
 
 The campaign needed a disciplined day on message. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, joked on Twitter after the speech in Greensboro, N.C., that she was one of the supporters in the back of the event who kept shouting, “Stay on the issues!” At one point in Charlotte, Conway appeared in the media filing area and spoke to reporters: “He’s always on message, don’t you think?” 
 
 Trump appeared ready to wrap up several times, only to find himself taking on another sweeping range of topics. At one point, within a single five-minute frame he discussed: 
 
 Iran’s nuclear capabilities 
 
 Gen. George Patton 
 
 Political correctness 
 
 The fight in Mosul, Iraq 
 
 Why politicians shouldn’t reveal military plans 
 
 Patton, again

 The crowd, regardless of the teleprompters or the microphone or the speech, cheered enthusiastically as he joked with them. And they agreed when he asked if they were having a good time.

 The Clinton campaign gathered its top national security advisers for a blistering conference call with reporters on Friday, framing the email dump as a provocative cyber-attack by foreign adversaries with ties to terror groups. 
 
 ADVERTISEMENT 
 
 The advisers described the hacks as unprecedented interference in the U.S. election that threatens the nation’s sovereignty, and warned there would be “consequences” for the hackers and potentially the “Russian state actors” supporting them. 
 
 The campaign lashed out at Trump, arguing he is encouraging the behavior. They questioned whether he and his advisers, driven by their own foreign business interests, have conspired to aid the Russians. 
 
 
 
 And Clinton’s allies fumed at the media’s coverage of the leaked emails, saying the focus has been on trivial political minutia rather than the national security implications. 
 
 
 
 “I’m not saying this as a Democrat or a Republican. I’m not saying this as someone who has endorsed Hillary Clinton. I’m saying this as someone who cares deeply about our national security,” said former CIA acting director Mike Morell. “I’m simply enraged by these Russian hacks.” 
 
 
 
 WikiLeaks, led by founder Julian Assange, a fierce Clinton critic, has been publishing batches of emails stolen from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. 
 
 
 
 Between now and Election Day, WikiLeaks is expected to release up to 40,000 more emails, in what appears to be a bid to undermine Clinton’s presidential campaign. 
 
 
 
 The intelligence community has said the Russians are behind the hack. The FBI is investigating the extent to which Moscow may have been involved. 
 
 
 
 The emails have been catnip for Washington insiders, giving an unvarnished glimpse inside Clinton’s inner circle and the day-to-day activities of her political machine. 
 
 
 
 But there have also been several potentially damaging revelations that Trump has vowed to make the centerpiece of his campaign in the final weeks before the election. 
 
 
 
 Clinton was revealed to have said she has different views on certain issues depending on whether she’s in “public or private;” something she struggled to account for at the last debate. 
 
 
 
 In a private speech given to a Wall Street banks, Clinton apparently touted her support for “open borders.” 
 
 
 
 One exchange appeared to show now-Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile tipping Clinton off to a question ahead of a debate against Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders defends his view that Trump is a liar Senate Dems introduce bill to block Trump's revised travel order Overnight Defense: Trump signs new travel order that excludes Iraq | Ex-Gitmo detainee killed in Yemen airstrike MORE, although Brazile has denied that happened. 
 
 
 
 And one of Clinton’s top advisers, Jennifer Palmieri, has been criticized for an email disparaging Catholics and Christians. 
 
 
 
 The Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the emails and has sought to cast doubt on the exchanges by insinuating that the hackers and WikiLeaks may have doctored the contents. 
 
 
 
 Now, they’re ramping up pressure on all of the involved parties, including the press, warning that the hack represents a grave threat to U.S. interests and should not be exploited for political purposes. 
 
 
 
 “It shakes me to my core,” Morell said. “This is a direct assault on our democracy. It’s a direct assault on how we choose our leaders. And quite frankly, I can’t think of a more serious issue at the moment than Russia trying to interfere in our election.” 
 
 
 
 The Clinton campaign is using the emails to hammer Trump, accusing him of “using Moscow talking points;” of encouraging further attacks by reading WikiLeaks releases at rallies; and of sewing disunity among U.S. allies as an “unwitting ally” of Putin. 
 
 
 
 Clinton’s advisers are suggesting that Trump has gone easy on Putin because of his business interests in the region, and have warned that if elected president, he would exploit his relationship with Russian leaders for personal financial gain. 
 
 
 
 And they alleged that Trump’s allies, like former campaign manager Paul Manafort and longtime ally Roger Stone, “may have relationships” with the Russians and could be involved in “getting this material out.” 
 
 
 
 “It is hard for me to even understand how someone who is a aspiring to be president would encourage these types of attacks, which are so unprecedented in terms of our democracy,” said Matt Olsen, a Clinton supporter and the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center. 
 
 
 
 The Clinton campaign is leaning on the media for its coverage of the emails, saying their focus needs to be redirected from the political impact and the insider gossip to the “geo-strategic” implications. 
 
 
 
 “What’s frustrating to me as someone involved with the media over the years — each little detail gets out in the press but the whole story, all these little pieces of the puzzle, are not put together in a way that educates the American people about the significance of this act of cyber-sabotage,” said Jamie Rubin, a national security adviser to Clinton. 
 
 
 
 So far, the emails have been overshadowed by the mounting accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump. 
 
 
 
 But the Clinton campaign is worried about the contents of future releases, and furiously pushing back at reports of new details from email threads they say provide only partial information or have been mischaracterized by their political rivals or the press. 
 
 
 
 “We have to have Donald Trump condemn the cyber sabotage conducted by Russia,” said Rubin. “At a minimum, we have to have information about the extent to which his people worked with or not, the Russian organizations. And we have to have information about the extent to which the Trump organization has business interests in Russia that could be affected.” ||||| CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign rallies have turned into eruptions of barely contained emotions from his impassioned followers, who urge him to fight on despite a series of gut punches that have put his chances of winning in doubt.

 With the Nov. 8 election now only weeks away and polls turning against him, Trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. 
 
 What he would do if elected is covered, but much of his speeches are spent belittling his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He also accuses the U.S. news media of a plot to bring him down, and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame. 
 
 Opinion polls show a gloomy picture for Trump. A week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women, the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll on Friday showed Clinton up, with 44 percent to Trump’s 37 percent. 
 
 And the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero. One woman at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday wore a homemade T-shirt that said “Trump Can Grab My,” with an arrow pointing to her crotch. 
 
 On Friday in Greensboro, North Carolina, a man wearing a “Gays for Trump” shirt punched a protester who held up an upside down American flag. Both were ejected. 
 
 Trump’s message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about Clinton, who Trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state. “She would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office,” he said. 
 
 ‘SO JADED ALREADY’ 
 
 A crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up Clinton at an event in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. 
 
 “Lock her up!” they chanted, mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events. 
 
 Trump could only smile and shake his head. 
 
 “So young and so jaded already,” he said. 
 
 The New York businessman feeds off the energy generated by crowds that pack his rallies by the thousands. But he is easily distracted, lurching from topic to topic based on whatever happens to sprint to mind. 
 
 On Wednesday in Lakeland, Florida, Trump jumped from bashing the news media as “the most dishonest people you’ll ever see,” to tout his performance at a debate in St. Louis on Sunday - “which I won big league” - to Clinton’s stroll across the stage in front of him at that event. 
 
 “And the papers said I invaded her space,” he said. “Believe me, the last space I want to invade is hers.” 
 
 There are moments of levity. A woman who recovered from a brief fainting spell in the heat of Lakeland was pointed out by Trump. 
 
 “That woman was out cold and now she is recovered — a little ding to the head,” he said, approvingly. 
 
 Trump can form an attack line against Clinton out of pretty much anything that springs to mind. 
 
 Venting about Chinese trade practices before a raucous crowd of perhaps 20,000 in Cincinnati on Thursday night, Trump suddenly imagined how China might treat Clinton given her bout of pneumonia a month ago, which had caused her to nearly collapse at an event in New York. 
 
 “If she goes down in Tiananmen Square, they’ll just leave her,” he said. “They’re tough people.” 
 
 Trump’s crowds sometimes get agitated.

 Many of his supporters are upset at the news media, whipped into a frenzy by both Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who in Cincinnati introduced Trump by condemning “the insanity of the media, the insanity of the way they cover him.” 
 
 Upon entering the arena, Trump’s traveling press corps was booed by thousands of people who chanted “tell the truth.” Trump boosters near the media work area repeatedly cursed and taunted reporters. 
 
 “When are you all going to be ashamed of yourselves?” one man shouted. “Lower than Congress — that’s what your approval rating is.” ||||| Donald Trump might sue the New York Times. The Times might just want that to happen. 
 
 If Trump sues the Times over its reporting, the Republican nominee for president risks opening up his personal life to lawyers, providing access that would otherwise be private. He'd also almost certainly be the subject of a deposition, in which he, his family and many others would have to answer questions under oath about his behavior with women. 
 
 ""It's his butler. It's the help around him generally. It's his kids. It's his ex wife. It's his girlfriends if you can identify them ... it's all that stuff,"" said Stuart Karle, general counsel at North Base Media and an adjunct professor at the Columbia School of Journalism. ""It would just be a rich vain of yuck about Donald Trump."" 
 
 It all began on Wednesday night when the newspaper published the accounts of two women who claimed to have been groped by the presidential candidate. Trump denied the claims and attacked the Times. 
 
 That could have been chalked up to just another dust up between Trump and a media outlet. He's had plenty through his campaign, even operating an informal blacklist that included the Times and other outlets, such as the Washington Post and Politico. 
 
 Not this time. The Times, the Trump campaign feinted, had gone too far. Sources from the Trump camp told numerous reporters that a lawsuit was being drawn up. One of Trump's lawyers sent a letter to the Times demanding a retraction. The Times fired back with the legal equivalent of ""come at me, bro."" 
 
 The discovery issue 
 
 The newspaper has a good reason to be cocky. A lawsuit would mean that Trump would be subject to a legal process called ""discovery,"" in which lawyers for the Times are allowed to pore through the relevant histories of those involved in the case. 
 
 David McCraw, NYT lawyer, responds to Trump’s letter. pic.twitter.com/ziPBCIjkvP — Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) October 13, 2016 
 
 In this case, that would mean Trump's sexual and romantic history. The inquisition would not necessarily stop with the women from the Times story. 
 
 ""They might start talking about other women that were involved to see if there was a pattern of conduct,"" said Chip Stewart, associate dean of the college of communication at Texas Christian University. ""They could be asking a lot of questions that would be embarrassing to him."" 
 
 ""There’s a big difference between Trump threatening to sue and actually suing — and he often never follows through ..."" 
 
 Tim O'Brien knows this better than almost anyone. Trump sued O'Brien in 2006 over an allegation in O'Brien's book ""TrumpNation"" that The Donald was worth far less than he led people to believe. 
 
 As part of that lawsuit, O'Brien's lawyers deposed Trump as part of the discovery process. Trump was caught lying 30 times. 
 
 ""Discovery can have a very, very long long arm with people in the business world. And that's why a lot of them are careful about it and aren't as flagrant about threatening to sue people,"" O'Brien said in an interview with Mashable. 
 
 O'Brien, now the executive editor of Bloomberg Gadfly and Bloomberg View, assured reporters on Thursday that they didn't have much to fear. In an article entitled ""Don't Fear Trump's Lawsuits. He'll Keep Losing,"" O'Brien noted Trump will not want to open himself up to discovery. 
 
 ""...there’s a big difference between Trump threatening to sue and actually suing — and he often never follows through with his threats anyway,"" O'Brien wrote. ""So exhale and keep reporting aggressively all of you scribes."" 
 
 A Reuters report found that despite many threats, Trump hasn't sued a newspaper in 30 years. 
 
 The Times did not respond to a request for comment on the discovery process. 
 
 The legal issue

 Maybe Trump would be willing to suffer through discovery if he stood a legitimate chance of convincing a jury that the Times committed libel. 
 
 Trump, however, stands little chance. 
 
 In this case, Trump's lawyers would need to show that the Times acted with ""actual malice"" — meaning that not only are the claims untrue, but that the Times knew that the claims were untrue. Also, because Trump is a public figure, he would need to prove that those false claims defamed him — something that the Times lawyers pointed out will be difficult to do due to Trump's own public statements. 
 
 The paper would certainly end up having to pay some legal fees to defend itself against a theoretical Trump lawsuit, but that might end up being money well spent. 
 
 Writing on the legal blog Above the Law, Elie Mystal argued that the documents the Times would collect during the discovery process would be extremely valuable to its reporting. 
 
 Other documents, or videos, about Trump’s past sexual conduct would become relevant. Trump would be deposed, under oath, about his sexual escapades. The Times would LOVE Donald Trump to sue them over this. They’d never settle. There would be a public trial where all this stuff would come out. They’d win a freaking Pulitzer. 
 
 Even if Trump were to sue, none of this would play out particularly quickly. Civil lawsuits tend to drag on for months or years. Trump almost certainly wouldn't be deposed until well after the election. 
 
 That's a prospect that wouldn't seem to be appealing to Trump. If he wins, he's a sitting president forced to confront allegations of sexual assault. If he loses, he's a failed politician forced to confront allegations of sexual assault. ||||| Tweet with a location

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the 2016 presidential campaign (all times EDT): 
 
 9 a.m. 
 
 Donald Trump has taken to Twitter on Saturday morning to go after Hillary Clinton and the media, and to claim again that the presidential race is looking like — in his words — ""a rigged election."" 
 
 That's an unprecedented assertion in a country with a history of peaceful democratic transition. 
 
 Trump is denying stories in which some women have accused him of sexual misconduct. 
 
 He says the allegations are ""100 percent fabricated and made-up charges"" and are being pushed by the Clinton campaign and the media. Trump says they ""may poison the minds of the American Voter"" and he claims: ""FIX!"" 
 
 Trump tweets that such ""false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies"" are being pushed before the Nov. 8 election in order to put Clinton in the White House. ||||| CLOSE Cyrus Schenck, founder of Renoun ski in Burlington, Vermont, came up with a unique pair of skis to highlight the presidential race, one featuring Democrat Hillary Clinton, on the left of course, and Republican Donald Trump on the right. RYAN MERCER/FREE PRESS

 Hillary and The Donald are hitting the slopes together this winter, thanks to a local ski company. 
 
 Cyrus Schenck of Renoun ski in Burlington has introduced limited edition Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton skis — Trump is the right ski, Hillary is the left ski — featuring ornate artwork by local graphic artist Jamie Tam. 
 
 ""It's one of those things we expect people to hang on their wall,"" Schenck said. ""It is artwork."" 
 
 The skis also are a no-holds-barred, comic book portrayal of the voluminous indiscretions, faults and weaknesses of the candidates in a presidential election unprecedented for its controversy and general distaste for the American public. 
 
 ""I gave Jamie some sketches, he was like, 'All right, I got this,'"" Schenck said. ""He went to town. There's so much detail."" 
 
 The tops of the skis — red for Republican Trump, blue for Democrat Clinton — feature portraits of the candidates wearing buttons that say ""#1 most disliked"" for Trump, and ""#2 most disliked"" for Clinton. A police tape weaves in and out of the collage of images on Clinton's ski, intended to reflect the lack of trust some voters feel in her, Schenck said. A border wall runs throughout the images on Trump's ski, reflecting his plan to wall off the United States from Mexico. 
 
 ""We didn't hold back on this,"" Schenck said.

 That's clear in the image of a naked Trump covered by a fig leaf and a character pointing to him, saying, ""Tiny hands..."" On Clinton's ski, a ringing phone is captioned ""Benghazi is calling."" Yet, Schenck is unconcerned about offending anyone. 
 
 ""Any kind of offense we might stir up will pale in comparison to what has already been said by the candidates,"" he said. 
 
 Schenck said Renoun will make 50 pairs of the Trump/Clinton skis, at a retail price of $2,016 per pair. Non-partisan Renoun skis that don't make a political statement cost $1,150 to $1,395 per pair. 
 
 Schenck, 25, launched his company in 2015 utilizing a new technology — a layer of non-Newtonian material that allows the skis to instantly change their characteristics to suit conditions, whatever they might be. 
 
 Non-Newtonian is an umbrella term that can apply to a wide range of materials that don't exhibit a linear stress/strain relationship, including ketchup, Schenck explained last year. 
 
 ""Think about a ketchup bottle,"" he said. ""Turn it upside down, and it just stays there. It doesn't come out. If you shake it, it comes flying out. So the more of an impact, the less viscous, the runnier it becomes. The stuff we use is the opposite. The harder you hit it, the more thick it becomes."" 
 
 Schenck said his skis have been met with skepticism in some circles — until the skeptics strapped them on. 
 
 ""Guys want to call you out, but they get on them and they can't,"" he said. 
 
 Renoun has increased production by about 70 percent this year, Schenck said. He expects to generate about $250,000 in revenue this ski season. All Renoun skis, including the Hillary and Trump models, are sold exclusively online, direct to consumers.

 ""We just sent out 100 T-shirts to customers, thanking them for being part of the family,"" Schenck said. 
 
 Schenck declined to say who he will be voting for next month.

 So he feels stuck, as do many voters. 
 
 As early voting begins in Ohio and elsewhere, many Americans are approaching the election with a sense of dread. In a CBS News poll released earlier this month, just 46 percent of likely voters said they were very enthusiastic about going to the polls, down from 62 percent in late October 2012, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. What’s uncertain this year is how many people will cast reluctant votes and how many won’t vote at all.

 Mr. Pappas, 63, and his wife Kathy, 57, have owned the diner for 28 years.

 Taxi app company Uber has applied for a patent to use artificial intelligence to determine how drunk potential passengers might be. 
 
 The app used to summon rides could also feed other information to the driver, including a passenger's location, how accurately they are typing and even the angle they are holding their phone at. 
 
 It could help drivers who do not want to pick up inebriated riders. 
 
 But critics said it could also be used to identify vulnerable passengers. 
 
 According to the application to the US patent office, the system would spot ""uncharacteristic user activity"". 
 
 Uber does not have the best track record when it comes to collecting data. 
 
 In 2014 it was revealed the company used a software program known as God View to monitor real-time locations of customers and drivers. 
 
 That, coupled with a data breach that exposed personal data about more than 100,000 Uber drivers, made the company introduce tough measures to protect the privacy of drivers and customers. 
 
 Uber's co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned in June 2017 over allegations of sexual harassment at the scandal-hit company. 
 
 CNN reported that more than 100 Uber drivers in the US had been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing passengers in the past four years, with 31 drivers convicted of crimes including false imprisonment and rape. 
 
 Critics expressed concern that an app that could predict user behaviour could be used by drivers wishing to prey on vulnerable passengers. 
 
 In a statement, Uber said: ""We are always exploring ways that our technology can help improve the Uber experience for riders and drivers. 
 
 ""We file patent applications on many ideas, but not all of them actually become products or features."" ||||| 
 
 Uber has filed a patent application to develop technology that can help determine whether or not a rider is drunk. (Toby Melville/Reuters) 
 
 Ever struggled to hold a phone steady while ordering an Uber? 
 
 What about plugging typos into a pickup or drop-off address? 
 
 Those are some of the flags Uber could one day use to predict whether its riders have had too much to drink. 
 
 Uber has a pending application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the technology that would help the ride-hailing giant tell drunk riders from sober ones. The idea is in its early stages, and the company has no immediate plans to start using the technology as described in the application. 
 
 But as with other uses of artificial intelligence, the technology also raises questions of how it would actually work, and how Uber could use and store data on the health and lifestyle choices of its users. Some privacy experts caution that the technology could misfire and discriminate against certain passengers, including with those physical disabilities. And they worry that the technology could deter riders who are drunk from using the service — and risk getting behind the wheel. 
 
 “We are always exploring ways that our technology can help improve the Uber experience for riders and drivers,” said Jodi Page, an Uber spokesperson. “We file patent applications on many ideas, but not all of them actually become products or features.” 
 
 Uber’s patent application, which was initially filed in December 2016, says that when riders request a car, the system collects information about the rider’s activity and includes that data in the ride request. To predict a rider’s state, the system compares data from that ride request to past ones. Past trip information may be used to “identify how the user activity of the current trip request deviates from previous (or ‘normal’) behavior for that user,” the application says. 
 
 For example, the system may track how many typos appear in a new ride request, or the angle at which the rider holds a phone when hailing an Uber. 
 
 Based on how the system interprets that behavior, it may adjust how it arranges a match with a driver, the application said. 
 
 “Some examples of trip variations include matching the user with only certain [drivers], alerting a [driver] about the user’s possible unusual state, and modifying pickup or drop-off locations to areas that are well lit and easy to access,” the application said. 
 
 The application also notes that “when the likelihood is comparatively very high” that a rider is acting out of the ordinary, that rider may not be matched with any driver, or may only be matched with drivers “with experience or training with users having an unusual state.” And when the likelihood is comparatively low, the system may match riders “normally.” 
 
 It’s still unclear how the patent, if approved, would be applied, and whether Uber would make use of it. But the patent application alone raised questions of its potential shortcomings and dangers. 
 
 John Simpson, director of the Privacy Project at the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog, said use of the technology could damage Uber’s business model, given that many riders rely on the service after drinking and when they know it would be unsafe to drive. 
 
 Simpson said he worried that the technology wouldn’t be able to differentiate drunkenness from other reasons a rider could have an unsteady hand. For example, a rider who has Parkinson’s or a hand tremor might be interpreted by the app as being drunk. 
 
 “My big, serious concern is it seems to be there are a whole host of other conditions that might come across as if a person were intoxicated when they weren’t at all, and might need an Uber because they’re physically handicapped,” Simpson said. 
 
 Jeff Chester, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, said he worried that riders who depend on the service for their transportation needs could shy away from it knowing that their drinking habits and health data were being collected. 
 
 And he worried how the system would discriminate against people based on their age or race, as well as how frequently they request rides from certain locations and at what time of the day or night. 
 
 The technology would be unique in identifying drunkenness in passengers as opposed to drivers, noted J.T. Griffin, chief government affairs officer of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Griffin said that one of the best measures against drunk driving is expanding the options for how to get people home safely. 
 
 But as for whether riders who have been drinking might be less inclined to use the service as a result, “that is something that the public will have to decide,” Griffin said. “And Uber will have to be very careful in how they collect and what they plan on doing with that data.”

 I was team #DeleteUber. Can Uber’s new boss change my mind?","– Keeping your drunkenness a secret from your Uber driver might be impossible in a future world, no matter how much silence emanates from the backseat. A patent application shows that Uber may be interested in trying to figure out whether potential passengers are drunk by analyzing everything from typos in the ride request to whether the phone was swaying, reports the Guardian. While it's only theoretical at this point, the idea is that certain behavior would trigger a reaction from Uber if it differs from behavior during past ride requests, reports the Washington Post. For example, a specially trained driver might arrive to transport a drunk passenger and make sure the person is dropped off in a safe spot. The app might also keep a drunk passenger from pooling with other riders. All this ""sounds helpful,"" but ""poses questions about the potential for data like this to be abused,"" writes Arwa Mahdawi in the Guardian. Would drunk passengers have to pay more than others? And given that many of the abuse allegations lodged against Uber drivers have come from passengers who were drunk at the time, the system could theoretically put people at risk. Experts also fear the technology could single out people with disabilities or keep users from hailing a ride when drunk or high, per the Post. But though the patent was filed in December 2016, there's no plan to put the idea into practice yet.

 Ms. Rowe, a freshman at the university, described her roommate’s behavior in a Facebook video on Monday, and accused the school of attempting to keep the episode quiet. 
 
 She said that the revelations, posted on Instagram as she was moving out, had helped explain why she had been sick early in the school year, suffering from extreme throat pain that eventually made it difficult to sleep or speak. 
 
 Ms. Rowe said that she and Ms. Brochu had been placed together randomly and that their relationship had been tense. 
 
 “I moved out because I felt like I was unwanted in my own room,” she said. 
 
 As she was in the process of moving, Ms. Rowe said, other residents approached her about several posts Ms. Brochu had made on social media. They included pictures of bloodstains on Ms. Rowe’s backpack and videos of Ms. Rowe eating, with comments suggesting that the utensils she was using had been contaminated. 
 
 Ms. Brochu had already been charged by the time Ms. Rowe posted the video. But Ms. Rowe expressed frustration that it had taken so long for Ms. Brochu to be punished. 
 
 She said that school authorities had told her if she spoke out about the situation, she could be removed from her campus residence. And she said that race had been a factor in the school’s response, speculating that if she were white and Ms. Brochu were black, the investigation would have been more urgent.

 “If the race roles were reversed, I feel like this would have gone down a different route,” she said.

 The university’s undergraduate student body is 15 percent African-American, according to statistics posted on its website. 
 
 Ms. Rowe did not respond to emails requesting further comment on Wednesday. 
 
 Her video catapulted her experience into the news, with the hashtag #justiceforjazzy — based on the name she uses on Facebook — being used to spread her story. 
 
 In a statement posted online Tuesday, Mr. Woodward called Ms. Brochu’s behavior “reprehensible” and said that he was confident that the university had pursued the matter seriously. 
 
 “The university strictly and swiftly followed all procedural and legal processes related to this alleged event; claims to the contrary are based on misinformation,” he said. “The incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus.” 
 
 Mr. Woodward followed up on Wednesday with the statement announcing Ms. Brochu’s expulsion. That statement clarified the timeline, saying that the school’s public safety department became involved on Oct. 17 and that the case was turned over to the local authorities early the next day. 
 
 Molly Polk, a spokeswoman for the university, said that the school had followed its standard procedures, immediately referring the case to the police. She said that Mr. Woodward had not been accusing Ms. Rowe of spreading misinformation in his initial statement, and that he was instead referencing the almost instantaneous reaction to the video among people on social media. 
 
 Ms. Polk added that the residential staff had asked Ms. Rowe not to act on the matter on her own, but insisted that “their intention was never to try to keep her quiet.”","– A University of Hartford student has been expelled and is facing a hate crime charge after allegedly waging a disgusting campaign to force the black roommate she nicknamed ""Jamaican Barbie"" to move—and bragging about it online.

Brochu was arrested Saturday and admitted licking utensils and smearing bodily fluids on the backpack of Chennel Rowe, though the 18-year-old said she invented other claims to ""appear funny,"" the Hartford Courant reports.

217,"The 'Berlin patient' is an HIV-positive man who developed acute myeloid leukaemia, received successful treatment and subsequently experienced a relapse in 2007 that required a transplant of stem cells. 
 
 Doctors chose stem cells from an individual who had an unusual genetic profile: a mutation inherited from both parents that resulted in CD4 cells that lacked the CCR5 receptor. This mutation, called CCR5 delta 32 homozygosity, is present in less than 1% of Caucasians in northern and western Europe, and is associated with a reduced risk of becoming infected with HIV. 
 
 This is because all new infecting viruses need to use the CCR5 receptor on CD4 cells when infecting an immune system cell of the CD4 type. 
 
 Later in the course of HIV infection another type of virus emerges that can use the CXCR4 receptor instead. 
 
 Before the stem cell transplant the patient received chemotherapy treatment that destroyed most immune cells and total body irradiation, and also received immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the stem cells. 
 
 Antiretroviral therapy was halted on the day of the transplant, and the patient had to receive a second stem cell transplant 13 days after the first one, due to a further relapse of leukaemia. 
 
 The patient continued to receive immunosuppressive treatment to prevent rejection for 38 months, and at 5, 24 and 29 months post-transplant colon biopsies were taken to investigate possible graft-versus-host disease in the intestine. At each investigation additional samples were taken to check for signs of HIV infection in the abundant immune cells of the gut wall. 
 
 During the 38 month follow-up period the donor CD4 cells repopulated the mucosal immune system of the gut, to such an extent that the frequency of CD4 cells was almost twice as high as in HIV-negative healthy controls, and this phenomenon was also seen in a control group of ten HIV-negative individuals who received stem cell transfers. 
 
 The repopulation of CD4 cells was accompanied by the complete disappearance of host CD4 cells, and after two years the patient had the CD4 count of a healthy adult of the same age. 
 
 One of the challenges for any approach to curing HIV infection is long-lived immune system cells, which need to be cleared before a patient can be cured. In the case of the Berlin patient CCR5-bearing macrophages could not be detected after 38 months, suggesting that chemotherapy had destroyed these longer-lived cells, and that they had also been replaced by donor cells. 
 
 The German researchers and San Francisco-based immunologist Professor Jay Levy believe that the findings point to the importance of suppressing the production of CCR5-bearing cells, either through transplants or gene therapy. 
 
 The patient did not resume antiretroviral therapy after the transplant. 
 
 Nevertheless HIV remained undetectable by both viral load testing (RNA) and tests for viral DNA within cells, and HIV antibody levels declined to the point that the patient has no antibody reactivity to HIV core antibodies, and only very low levels of antibodies to the HIV envelope proteins. 
 
 Seventeen months after the transplant the patient developed a neurological condition, which required a brain biopsy and lumbar puncture to sample the cerebrospinal fluid for diagnostic purposes. HIV was also undetectable in the brain and the CSF. 
 
 An additional indication that HIV is not present lies in the fact that the patient’s CD4 cells are vulnerable to infection with virus that targets the CXCR4 receptor. If any virus with this preference was still present, the researchers argue, it would be able to swiftly infect the large population of memory CD4 cells that has emerged. ||||| On the heels of World AIDS Day comes a stunning medical breakthrough: Doctors believe an HIV-positive man who underwent a stem cell transplant has been cured as a result of the procedure. 
 
 Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the ""Berlin Patient,"" received the transplant in 2007 as part of a lengthy treatment course for leukemia. His doctors recently published a report in the journal Blood affirming that the results of extensive testing ""strongly suggest that cure of HIV infection has been achieved."" 
 
 Brown's case paves a path for constructing a permanent cure for HIV through genetically-engineered stem cells. 
 
 Last week, Time named another AIDS-related discovery to its list of the Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs of 2010. Recent studies show that healthy individuals who take antiretrovirals, medicine commonly prescribed for treating HIV, can reduce their risk of contracting the disease by up to 73 percent. 
 
 While these developments by no means prove a cure for the virus has been found, they can certainly provide hope for the more than 33 million people living with HIV worldwide. Alongside such findings, global efforts to combat the epidemic have accelerated as of late, with new initiatives emerging in the Philippines and South Africa this week.","– In another potentially big break in the treatment of AIDS, scientists believe that an HIV-positive man has been cured by a stem cell transplant, the Huffington Post reports.

 HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — An obsession with the Wild West compelled then-Mayor Steve Reed to scour the country for artifacts and plan for a museum to house them all in the unlikely location of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 
 
 The museum never came close to being built, and on Monday prosecutors and his lawyers will begin to pick a jury for Reed's trial on 112 counts of receiving stolen property. 
 
 Investigators say they recovered some 1,800 artifacts, many from his home, and jurors will hear about dozens of them. They include stagecoach equipment, saddles, a dice game known as chuck-a-luck, copies of the Tombstone Epitaph newspaper, knives and a gun collection that includes a ""Whorehouse Box w/pin fire revolver."" 
 
 His lawyer, Henry Hockeimer Jr., said Reed, who is dealing with what he described as serious health issues, denies the allegations. 
 
 ""Suffice to say that we believe the evidence at trial will show that Mr. Reed ... did not steal anything and was in fact in lawful possession of the items the attorney general's office charged him with,"" Hockeimer said. 
 
 As to why he is charged with receiving stolen property, as opposed to theft, Hockeimer said prosecutors ""never have completely articulated their theory."" 
 
 Reed, a Democrat, had been a phenomenally successful politician in Pennsylvania's capital city, winning re-election six times and receiving plaudits for revitalizing the city's dingy downtown. 
 
 A centerpiece of his economic development strategy had been a planned network of museums to draw tourists, including a Civil War museum that did get built. 
 
 But the Wild West museum was clearly his pet project, an effort he continued to push even after it became public and attracted derision and pointed questions about the costs, paid by a city fund that Reed controlled. A grand jury report issued nearly two years ago described Reed's compulsion to buy artifacts as ""an almost pathological preoccupation."" 
 
 A former spokesman, Randy King, told the grand jury that Reed would send so many boxes back from buying trips they would sometimes clog the mayor's office, making it difficult for city employees to maneuver. 
 
 King testified that city officials tried to stop Reed, telling him: ""'You've got to stop this, you've got to cut it out, it's just going to kill your career,' but that Reed would not listen,"" the grand jury wrote. ""He would simply repeat to them that he was 'almost finished.'"" 
 
 Reed's museum plan had its supporters: as the scandal became public in 2003, a member of the board that oversaw the spending described him as ""the Walt Disney of our time in central Pennsylvania."" 
 
 But by the next year Reed had to put the project on ice. Harrisburg was already starting to stagger under the weight of hundreds of millions in Reed-era debt tied to a trash incinerator, a financial crisis that nearly bankrupted Harrisburg. 
 
 The Wild West museum and artifact buying sprees were among the reasons Reed lost in the 2009 Democratic primary to one of his main critics, Linda Thompson. The city subsequently became the first Pennsylvania municipality to be taken over by the state. 
 
 Prosecutors have argued that Reed, 67, overpaid for many of the relics and collectibles. Under Thompson the city sold thousands of them, recovering about $4.4 million of the estimated $8.3 million the city paid for about 10,000 items. Experts said the collection was a mishmash of real treasures alongside fakes and junk. 
 
 A state investigator said a storage facility Reed maintained near his Harrisburg home was packed with artifacts and collectibles, as well as a re-creation he staged of his mayoral office, complete with civic awards. 
 
 ""That's one of many instances of poetic license taken by the attorney general's office in the drafting of the presentment,"" Hockeimer said. ""It's not fair, it's not correct."" 
 
 In May, a judge threw out 305 of the 449 counts filed against Reed, saying too much time had elapsed and the statutes of limitations had run. Prosecutors subsequently narrowed their case down again, to 114 counts. 
 
 Reed is also charged with one count of evidence tampering for trying to sell some of the artifacts on consignment, and one count of dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities. 
 
 More recently, Reed's lawyers have been trying to prevent prosecutors from using witness testimony of an appraiser, and to be able to tell jurors about the hundreds of charges that were previously dismissed. 
 
 ""The commonwealth did not bother to take any steps to evaluate whether the city of Harrisburg disposed of the property it is alleging Mr. Reed had stolen,"" his lawyers argued in a recent filing. The attorney general's office called that ""an incorrect recitation of the process."" 
 
 Trial is expected to take about a week and a half. ||||| HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - A sweeping corruption case against a former mayor of Pennsylvania’s capital city Harrisburg ended on Monday when he pleaded guilty to 20 counts of receiving stolen artifacts bought with public funds for a proposed museum that was never built in the city. 
 
 Former Mayor Stephen R. Reed, 67, made the plea on the morning when jury selection in his trial was scheduled to begin in Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas. As part of the plea deal, prosecutors dropped 94 other counts. 
 
 Reed, who was originally charged in 2015 with nearly 500 criminal counts, could receive up to nine months in prison under state sentencing guidelines when Judge Kevin Hess sentences him on Friday, although he may only get probation. 
 
 Many of the more serious charges, including bribery and siphoning money from bond issues, were dismissed last year on statute of limitations grounds. 
 
 “Today’s guilty plea marks the final chapter in a case that has gone on for several years,” said Deputy Attorney General Rebecca Frantz. “This will help the city of Harrisburg to move on.” 
 
 Reed, known as an avid private collector of Civil War and American West memorabilia during his 28 years in office, pleaded guilty to illegal possession of 20 historical documents and photographs with a total value of more than $18,000. 
 
 The artifacts were among thousands acquired by Reed with public funds for a proposed Museum of the American West that he had hoped to build in financially strapped Harrisburg. 
 
 After his plea, Reed told reporters he experienced “gut-wrenching humiliation and embarrassment” over his arrest, after serving as Harrisburg’s mayor for decades. 
 
 He said many of the artifacts seized from his home and warehouse during a raid in 2015 were legally owned by him, but similar to ones acquired with public funds for the museum. 
 
 He believes the 20 items in the plea were accidentally placed in boxes of his own papers after he hastily left office following his defeat in 2010, but acknowledged the packing was done under his supervision. 
 
 “The precepts of my faith require that I take responsibility for this error, and that was my ultimate deciding factor in doing this plea,” Reed said. 
 
 A hearing is scheduled in March on Reed’s petition for the return of artifacts he believes belong to him. Frantz said prosecutors would oppose that request. 
 
 Harrisburg has been under state financial supervision since 2011, primarily because of cost overruns on an incinerator retrofit project. ||||| Like Ahab with his white whale, ex-Harrisburg Mayor Stephen R. Reed has long been obsessed with historical artifacts, a vexation that played a key role in his political undoing and now appears to be part of criminal investigation into his time in office. 
 
 For much of his 28 years as mayor, a visit to Reed's dimly-lit City Hall office meant two things: Encountering a thick haze of cigarette smoke and being surrounded by a bevy of Civil War, Native American and Old West artifacts, which were crammed into both the mayor's conference room and his private quarters. 
 
 Reed made no secret of his obsession for all things Civil War, Native American and Western. Yet, the multi-million-dollar artifact collections he amassed using public funds from the Harrisburg Authority, the city's bond-making and utility-owning arm, were conducted largely behind the scenes, if not in total secrecy. 
 
 It became no secret that Reed also possessed a more modest private collection of artifacts, which he kept at his Cumberland Street rowhome. On Tuesday, nearly a dozen investigators raided Reed's midtown home and could be seen taking away saddles, a totem pole, what looked like a stuffed fox, a whiskey barrel and assorted other items, Eric Veronikis reported. 
 
 On Wednesday, an ailing Reed, who says he is suffering from stage 4 cancer that started in his prostate, broke his near total silence since being turned out of office in 2009, proclaiming that all of the artifacts in his home belonged to him. 
 
 Reed didn't elaborate, saying he was bound by a gag order related to the Office of the Attorney General's grand jury investigating Harrisburg's incinerator bond deal fiasco. Reed appeared before the panel in April. 
 
 But the then-mayor confronted the artifact issues head-on in a March 2009 interview conducted as he was preparing to mount a bid for his eighth term in office. Stung by the artifact backlash, as well as rising city deficits and service cuts related to runaway spending on the deeply indebted incinerator renovation, Reed would lose the Democratic primary to then-City Council President Linda Thompson. He quietly left office at the end of 2009, and has remained mostly mum ever since. 
 
 But in March 2009, as Reed was attempting to reassure voters, who for the first time seemed to be questioning his judgment, the mayor had this to say: 
 
 ""Never have I kept city- or authority-owned anything at my house, other than my pager. There are in the city government center different artifacts, some of them are in this room (his city office, where he pointed to an Indian buffalo head dress and several bound volumes on a table behind his desk.) Some city archival items are hanging out in the atrium; some are in the display cases downstairs; and some are in storage here. That's not many. The overwhelming majority of artifacts are in storage."" 
 
 His reassurances, however, would not be enough. Not by a long shot. 
 
 Winning the Civil War 
 
 The North won the Civil War, and then 130 years later Steve Reed attempted to purchase it in Harrisburg. Throughout the 1990s, Reed amassed thousands of Civil War items from both North and South, including the hat box for Abe Lincoln's famous stovepipe, if not the hat, itself. 
 
 The money came largely from bond fee proceeds and other non-tax funds from the Harrisburg Authority. The authority's board, which R eed hand-picked in those days, funneled the money into a ""special projects fund"" that financed tens of millions in artifact spending in the 1990s and 2000s. 
 
 Reed's gambit was this: The literally thousands of artifacts he would hastily hand-pick at retail dealers from Gettysburg to Arizona would become the city's local matching funds toward the building of state-financed museums in Harrisburg. 
 
 This was the very formula Reed used to build the National Civil War Museum in Reservoir Park, which opened in 2001. The $33.2 million project was split among the money Reed spent on literally thousands of Civil War artifacts, many of which remain stored away in the bowels of the museum, and state funds to build the place. Reed spent more than $17 million on those artifacts, at the state put in $16.2 million for construction. 
 
 All told, Reed planned five museums for Harrisburg, including an African-American history museum, a sports hall of fame on City Island and perhaps most famously, a Wild West museum in decidedly eastern Harrisburg. Only the Civil War museum and the much smaller-scale National Fire Museum, ever became reality. 
 
 Reed's ambitious – some would say, fool-hardy – artifact-spending for museums began to unravel in 2003, when word of Reed's prodigious spending on Western and Native American artifacts first surfaced in a July 6 front-page story in the Sunday Patriot-News. 
 
 The scoop detailed at least $4.8 million (and counting) in Western artifact spending and unveiled Reed's plan for a National Museum of the Old West. Reed said that nearly all of the $4.8 million came from underwriting fees charged to borrowers who use the Harrisburg Authority, the independent bond-issuing agency which funds or refinances public projects – and not taxpayer dollars. 
 
 Reed explained that Harrisburg Authority fees cannot be spent on city services such as police, fire protection, or any other operating expenses. The money must be spent on ""capital purchases"" – long-term investments which, Reed said, would include purchases for a city museum. 
 
 All these facts came to light only after an artifact dealer in Arizona contacted the Patriot-News with questions about the Harrisburg mayor spending wildly on Western artifacts during trips all over Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and beyond. 
 
 Reed had become instantly recognizable among antiques dealers and collectors in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming and California. And dealers said he was known for paying top dollar and almost never haggling over price. 
 
 One skeptical dealer, stunned by the money Reed was spending in Colorado Springs – as well as the mayor's practice of dispatching an armed city police officer to collect his finds -- began raising questions: 
 
 ""It made me wonder,"" Jack Johnson, a dealer at Cadillac Jack's Trading Post in Calhan, Colo., told the Patriot-News in 2003. ""Money's not an object for your mayor. He's buying stuff all over. I've never seen this in 20 years here."" 
 
 Pressed with these facts, Reed confirmed the spending in an interview, during which he released a list of his purchases six pages long and agreed to answer questions about his museum plans. His treasures included extensive collections on Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, as well as a complete Wells Fargo wagon. This would grow to become a 10,000-item Western collection owned by Harrisburg, for which Reed paid $8.3 million. 
 
 But one thing the city collection would not include was the $3,248 purchase at Cadillac Jack's. Reed promptly cancelled the order after the owner ratted him out. 
 
 At the time, Reed said his idea for a Wild West museum should have come as no surprise: ""I've repeatedly stated over the years the long-standing plan, as part of the city's overall economic development program, is to create national, first-class facilities to attract and retain business, jobs, residents and visitors,"" Reed said. 
 
 But why a Western museum in Harrisburg? 
 
 ""Why not?"" Reed asked. 
 
 Why not, indeed. 
 
 The Backlash Begins 
 
 Fred Clark, then a member of the Harrisburg Authority board that approved Reed's artifact spending, famously dubbed Reed as ""the Walt Disney of our time in central Pennsylvania."" But not everyone in Harrisburg saw it this way. 
 
 Jason Smith, then-owner of the marketing firm Fathom Design Group on North Second Street, saw Reed's Wild West museum idea as patently absurd, and the ad man used his gifts for words and images to subvert the proposal with biting humor and subversive wit, beginning in the fall of 2003. 
 
 Smith began by launching a website with slogans like, ""Just say 'neigh' to the Wild West Museum"" and ""Give the Wild West Museum the boot."" He would show up at City Council meetings, asking, ""Why are we buying Annie Oakley's underpants?"" And by 2005, Smith would be running for mayor against Reed. Among his campaign trinkets were Reed finger puppets, with Harrisburg's ""cowboy mayor"" decked out in a Stetson hat and leather chaps. 
 
 Smith would lose the election by a 3-to-1 margin, but the public relations damage was done. And Reed knew it. 
 
 Knocked off balance, Reed tried to recover by first putting his Wild West museum plans on hold in early 2004, then scrapped the idea altogether in fall 2006. He reluctantly agreed to begin selling off the now-10,000-item Western collection. But it was too late in many ways. 
 
 Ironically, the closest Reed ever came to realizing his vision of a Wild West museum was the lavish display of all of his best artifacts put on by a high-brow auction house in Dallas, Texas. Heritage Auctions did right by the collection, producing glossy catalogs with professional pictures and lavish descriptions of each impressive piece. Then all of the best artifacts were put on display in a football-field-sized exhibition hall in Dallas, where they were auctioned off to the highest bidder over a weekend of bidding. 
 
 There were pistols under glass; a pyramid-shaped display of cowboy boots and saddles; a caravan of stage coaches and wagons; a table of Indian moccasins; a wall of rare photos and art; and a range of rare rifles. All of it was carefully arranged, dramatically lit and imaginatively presented - a glimpse of the Western museum that might have been. 
 
 ""I think he definitely had a vision in mind when he assembled this collection,"" said Rawhide Johnson, a Western artifacts specialist from Cody, Wyo. ""It's impressive,"" he said. ""You can kind of get the idea of what the museum would have been like. I think he probably could be rated as a great visionary for what he tried to do."" 
 
 Alas, Reed did not travel to Dallas to see it. He cancelled his trip at the last minute, citing city business. 
 
 In the end, the Dallas auction and several subsequent city artifact sales recouped only a fraction of the $8 million-plus Reed spent on them. For example, the 2,914 guns, wagons, documents and old photos sold at the much-ballyhooed Dallas auction netted only $1.66 million – far short of the $8.3 million Mayor Stephen R. Reed spent acquiring the collection. Worse, the city's cataloging and storage of the items – most of which were crammed into a dusty warehouse by the city's trash incinerator – proved far less than ideal. 
 
 During his stint on the Harrisburg Authority board, current mayor Eric Papenfuse tried to make sense of the city's artifact inventory, attempting to match invoices with the items and track the authority's payment approvals and the current location for each item – only to be thoroughly frustrated and infuriated by incomplete or missing data. 
 
 Aside from the Civil War and Western artifacts, Reed had acquired numerous other items purportedly for the ""city archives."" Among them: a Sumerian bead necklace, Egyptian mummy items, a vampire kit, money from the French Revolution, World War II items and the like. 
 
 As a result, Papenfuse, after copying all of the authority's artifact records, made a public call for a criminal investigation in Sept. 2007. 
 
 By 2009, as Papenfuse was making a failed bid for City Council and Reed was running for re-election to an eighth term, Pepenfuse publicly stated that the FBI was investigating Reed's artifact spending and the way those purchases were handled and funded. Papenfuse said he knew this because he had been questioned by the Feds and had even been given a code name. The FBI, as is their custom, would neither confirm nor deny an investigation. But Reed, in his March 2009 interview, blasted the assertion. 
 
 ""I don't know what they would be investigating,"" Reed responded. ""A lot of artifacts were purchased. They were purchased for museum projects and the city archives. And it's all a matter of public record."" 
 
 A method to his madness? 
 
 Another troubling aspect of Reed's artifact spending was the seemingly arbitrary manner in which he amassed such a vast and costly collection, paying full retail prices at high-ticket tourist shops in well-traveled Western cities and towns. 
 
 In collecting for the Wild West museum, Reed would travel, either alone or with his friend and one-time city employee, John Lavenda. According to one dealer in Colorado Springs, the mayor simply breezed into a shop and then proceeded to spend thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes. 
 
 After picking out his loot, Reed would leave behind his mayor's business card, instructing the dealer to mail out an invoice. In reply, the Harrisburg Authority would cut a check. Reed's purchases were then crated up, but not shipped. 
 
 Instead, Reed would dispatch a city employee and an armed Harrisburg police officer to fly out West, rent a truck, pick up the treasures and drive them back to Harrisburg. On one such journey, the city employee and police officer spent two weeks making pick-ups in four Western states. Reed said this practice saved money on the professional armored transport that would otherwise be required for some of the more valuable items. 
 
 When Reed didn't find what he was looking for, he would leave behind handwritten wish lists with shopkeepers. For artifact dealers, these lists were like wanted posters, offering rewards in the form of top-dollar sales for the dealer who can locate the items. 
 
 In wake of the details about Reed's artifact-finding trips, some city officials raised questions about the travel, meal and personal reimbursement expenses Reed and others had put in for. They cited missing receipts, inadequate details and reimbursement forms submitted long after the trips and purchases were completed. Reed also submitted for reimbursement from the authority expenses for artifacts that he bought with his own money over the years. In the 2009 interview, Reed defended these practices: 
 
 ""They weren't personal items. They were items that I had purchased for the archives and museum projects. They were delivered here (to the city) from the very beginning. They were never anywhere else but delivered here. I didn't sell anything to the authority or the city. I got reimbursement for exactly what I paid to get those items. Not one penny more."" 
 
 As for working with a professional curator or consultant in acquiring artifacts, Reed had tried that approach with in amassing his Civil War collection -- and it came back to bite him. 
 
 Russell Pritchard III had advised Reed on his Civil War artifact purchases and sold items to Reed for the museum. But it turned out that Pritchard, who was an occasional volunteer appraiser for PBS's ""Antiques Roadshow,"" was staging phony appraisals and defrauding Civil War collectors, according to the FBI. 
 
 After the FBI probe, Pritchard was ordered to pay $830,000 in restitution – most of it to descendants of Confederate Gen. George Pickett, who alleged that Pritchard, then a buyer for The National Civil War Museum, bought military antiques from Pickett's family for $87,000 in 1995, only to sell them to the museum for $870,000. A jury had awarded the family more than $800,000 in damages in 1999. 
 
 And when Pritchard was given access to photograph Harrisburg collection, he switched a soldier's jacket valued at more than $30,000. It would finally be returned five years later. 
 
 Said Reed at the time: ""Pritchard violated our trust; he violated the law. They stole from others through fraudulent actions and put a taint on Civil War artifact preservation in this nation."" 
 
 Perhaps it was no coincidence then that when it came to collecting his Wild West artifacts, Reed would go it alone. 
 
 A Visionary's Lament 
 
 In his confessional March 2009 interview, as the then-mayor was preparing to face Harrisburg voters a final time, Reed expressed rare regret for his artifact obsession: 
 
 ""The biggest mistake that I made was not securing broad community buy-in to the plan to create nationally scaled museum facilities clustered in Harrisburg, Pa. It wasn't that there was any secret about it, but there wasn't any broad community process where everything was unveiled at one time, input invited, and so forth and so on. In retrospect, it would certainly be done differently... The genesis of all of this was the concept of Harrisburg becoming a much bigger player in ... the tourism business."" 
 
 In the end, however, the past has always been prologue for Steve Reed. 
 
 So as law enforcement agents hauled artifact after artifact from the ailing ex-mayor's home this week, one couldn't help but wonder whether this marked Reed's last round up.","– Former Harrisburg Mayor Steve Reed was a man with a bold vision: Building one of the country's finest Wild West museums in Pennsylvania. But while the Democrat spent years searching the West for artifacts and brought about 10,000 of them back, the museum never got built and he now faces trial on more than 100 counts relating to what prosecutors say was his obsession, the AP reports. Reed, who was mayor for 28 years before losing a primary election in 2009, has been charged with 112 counts of receiving stolen property, as well as one count of evidence tampering and one count of dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities. Hundreds of other charges, including theft, were thrown out last year because of the statute of limitations. Prosecutors say Reed, who successfully created the city's Civil War museum, used millions of dollars from the financially strapped city's bond issues to pay for artifacts like stagecoach equipment, Doc Holliday's dental chair, antique newspapers and guns, as well as a lot of forgeries, Reuters reports. He was known among dealers in the West for always paying top dollar and for sending an armed city cop to collect his many purchases, PennLive reported after he was charged in 2015. The city recovered about $4.4 million from selling thousands of the relics Reed bought, but some 1,800 other Old West artifacts were seized from his home and a warehouse he owns. The 67-year-old Reed's lawyers say he can prove he is the rightful owner of the seized items—and he wants them back.","<pad> An obsession with the Wild West compelled then-Mayor Steve Reed to scour the country for artifacts and plan for a museum to house them all in the unlikely location of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</s>",0.15686274258938873,0.03571428363494911,0.13725489945213382

 Usually game for after-meal selfies, a donkey statue at a popular Southwood restaurant could be endangered after a woman claimed the statuesque burro unexpectedly injured her. 
 
 Kimberly Bonn said she fell from the sometimes sombrero-wearing statue inside El Jalisco Mexican restaurant and broke her back almost 18 months ago. She is accusing the eatery of negligence. 
 
 In a Friday Leon County Circuit Court filing, Bonn claims that on Aug. 31, 2015, she mounted the life-size donkey statue to have her picture taken when she slipped off the back, fell on the floor and fractured her spine. 
 
 The civil complaint contends the restaurant encouraged customers to climb on the statue, which without a ladder, step or stair to assist and without a saddle on the slick surface created a safety hazard. El Jalisco, the complaint says, was negligent in creating the hazard without adequate safety features or determining the slick surface was dangerous. The complaint was first reported by Florida Politics. 
 
 Bonn is being represented by Morgan & Morgan attorney James G. Biggart. Attempts to reach the restaurant for a comment Tuesday were unsuccessful. 
 
 Meanwhile, others are speaking up for the attraction that is popular with both children and adult patrons. Worried fans created a ""For the Donkey"" Facebook page as news of the lawsuit galloped through Tallahassee Tuesday.

220,"May 18, 2015, 1:05 AM |The Republican senator from South Carolina says on ""CBS This Morning"" that he would officially announce whether he'll be running for president on June 1. Graham says he's been more ""right than wrong on foreign policy."" ||||| Jim Cole / AP ID: 5672497 
 
 WASHINGTON — If Lindsey Graham really runs for president, most expect him to serve as a protest candidate, pushing and provoking the rest of the Republican field on foreign policy. 
 
 There is one place, however, where any move Graham makes right now is affecting the Republican field: South Carolina. Republican contenders have descended on the early primary state to raise money and secure endorsements, but donors, lawmakers, and activists are in a bit of freeze — and at least for now, deferring to Graham’s clout in the state. 
 
 “A lot of folks I’ve talked to in a lot of the campaigns that have come through the state have mentioned the inability to raise money right now in South Carolina,” a political operative in the state told BuzzFeed News, “because so much of the donor class is waiting on Lindsey Graham’s decision.” 
 
 “It makes sense, he’s the senior senator from South Carolina: He ought to have a lot of good donor contacts. Those donors realize at the end of the day they have a voice in the Senate they can’t get crossways with,” the operative said. Activists “can’t do anything either right now, a lot of them.” 
 
 Like Iowa and New Hampshire, the state’s become busy fast, especially for certain candidates: Ted Cruz and Rick Perry have made 10 trips each; Marco Rubio has traveled there five times and has close ties to people in the state. Rand Paul has been there seven times and has relationships with quite a few members of the state’s congressional delegation. But for many South Carolinians, waiting to see what Graham does is as much about saving money as it is about politics. 
 
 “People are deferring to the senior senator, more from a financial standpoint than anything else,” said one former party official there who noted that he’d spoken with a donor who argued that Lindsey is “60 years old, this is his one shot at it.” 
 
 “He makes sense on national security, he could get lightning in a bottle on this Iran deal, and it saves me money now and I can still spend money later,” the official recalled the donor saying. 
 
 One Republican operative in the state said people were less impatient with Graham for causing a delay than they are eager for him to start running. 
 
 “There are a lot of people very eager to hear the answer, among activists, among donors,” the operative said. “Are they waiting to hear the answer so they can make plans? I would think so.” 
 
 According to Graham, people won’t have to wait much longer but he acknowledged in an interview with BuzzFeed News that many people were in a holding pattern waiting to see what he ultimately decides. 
 
 “Supporters are waiting to see what I do and the wait won’t be much longer. I’m 98.6% sure I will run,” Graham said. “I’m the senator and congressman they’ve known for 20 years… There’s a lot of support in South Carolina for the ideas I represent, not just me. But if I run, I run to win. I’m not running to make a point here. 
 
 “If I’m in this race in South Carolina, I will win South Carolina.” 
 
 South Carolina’s influential congressional delegation has been careful to not endorse anyone in the race at this point. One member of the delegation, speaking on background, said that politicians in the state generally wanted give Graham some room to decide, but it would not ultimately influence who they end up endorsing. 
 
 “Lindsey is a very pragmatic guy,” the lawmaker said. “He knows he has to make up his mind soon but he’s also not going to hold it against us if we go with someone else.” 
 
 Graham said that members of the delegation should “do what they think is best, I leave that decision to them.” 
 
 At the state party convention in Columbia last weekend, Graham spoke three times: at the Silver Elephant dinner, where he essentially announced a run; at a breakfast the next morning; and at the convention itself. “To Iowa and New Hampshire, hello,” Graham told the audience at the dinner. “To South Carolina, you have my heart, thank you very much.” He was enthusiastically received at all three events, but many activists are already loyal to other potential candidates who have already formed deep relationships in the state. 
 
 “I know there are a lot of people who have a fondness for Santorum and for Perry and for Huckabee off past years, and they have some deep roots here,” said Don Fort, a Republican activist from Charleston and former vice chair of his county party, who was attending the convention. 
 
 “I would expect [Graham] to have announced here and today, but on the whole I think he’s still waiting on money and numbers to really give him a yes/no, because it’s bound to step on some toes,” Fort said. 
 
 Though it’s a point of frustration currently, the deference to Graham among the state’s political establishment may not last for too long. Just Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz announced his South Carolina leadership team, that included state Sen. Lee Bright as a co-chairman. Bright unsuccessfully tried to primary Graham in the 2014 senate race. A senior political operative in the state predicted Graham would ultimately struggle in South Carolina if he chose to run for the White House. 
 
 “The state’s not going to rally behind him, because the Oval Office is 100% different than a single Senate seat,” the operative said. “And the candidates who are deferring to Sen. Graham are deferring only because it’s their best or only South Carolina strategy, at this point. Jeb certainly falls into that category.” 
 
 “Every other candidate is proceeding as if Sen. Graham doesn’t exist; that’s telling.” ||||| Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Monday that he will make his presidential ambitions known on June 1 in South Carolina. 
 
 “You’re all invited to come, spend money when you do, and I will tell you what I”m going to do about running for president,” Graham said on “CBS This Morning.” 
 
 Graham all but confirmed that he will jump in the race, saying in the interview, “I’m running because of what you see on television. I’m running because I think the world is falling apart. I’ve done more right than wrong on foreign policy. It’s not the fault of others, or their lack of this or that that makes me want to run. It’s my ability in my own mind to be a good commander in chief and to make Washington work.” 
 
 Graham teased his announcement in an email to supporters on Sunday afternoon. “As an announcement draws near, I need to know you stand with me,” Graham wrote, including a link where supporters could donate money.

 The South Carolina senator and foreign policy hawk has received support from several top donors, including billionaire Sheldon Adelson. The casino mogul co-chaired a luncheon for Graham’s PAC that immediately followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s March 3 speech to Congress. At the time, Graham had simply said he was “testing the waters” on 2016. 
 
 Should he declare his candidacy, Graham will enter a crowded Republican field currently lacking a presidential front-runner. But his chances of being competitive are slim. A recent NBC News/Marist poll shows that while the GOP senator is leading the field in the South Carolina primary, when it comes to all state voters, 58% think he shouldn’t even put his hat in the ring. 
 
 Graham earlier this month said he was 98.6% sure he was running. Then, just four days ago, he told South Carolina House Republicans that he was 99.9% sure. ||||| Lindsey Graham is telling donors that June 1 is the likely date for his presidential announcement, according to several sources familiar with the conversations. 
 
 The announcement would likely take place in South Carolina, possibly near his home base of Seneca, according to the sources, which would enable the GOP senator to highlight a compelling personal story not widely known outside his home state. 
 
 Story Continued Below 
 
 Graham grew up in nearby Central, S.C., in the back of a pool hall run by his parents, who died young. He helped raise his sister while going to college and serving in the Air Force. It’s a hardscrabble story that could help him stand out in a field of candidates with wealthy backgrounds, including Jeb Bush. 
 
 A spokeswoman for Graham said Thursday that she couldn’t confirm any information about a potential announcement. The senator’s team has suggested they were looking at a mid-May time frame. 
 
 Graham’s hawkish views would almost certainly be a central feature of an announcement speech as he weighs a bid premised on his experience on defense and foreign policy. While the three-term senator is a long shot to win the GOP nomination, he could play an important role in driving foreign policy and national security issues to the forefront of the primary debate. 
 
 Graham will be entering a crowded field of Republican presidential contenders that includes three fellow senators who have already formally kicked off their campaigns — Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. 
 
 So far, the candidates with whom Graham contrasts — and clashes — with most are Paul and Cruz, the former over foreign policy and the latter over his often-uncompromising conservative positions. 
 
 Graham has said he is “98.6 percent” sure he will run, and during appearances in the Palmetto State over the weekend, he all but announced that he’s in. 
 
 “To our enemies: Get ready, because there’s a new way of doing business coming,” Graham said last Friday at a state GOP Silver Elephant dinner. “To our friends: Get ready for the America that you used to know. To Iowa and New Hampshire: Hello. To South Carolina, you have my heart.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

222,"HOUSTON (AP) — A Texas judge cleared a woman Monday for a car accident that killed her fiance in 2004, after General Motors acknowledged that her car would have been among millions being recalled for a problem that may have contributed to the death. 
 
 Candice Anderson was driving a 2004 Saturn Ion when it suddenly veered off a road about 60 miles east of Dallas and slammed into a tree. Anderson, then 21, was severely injured when the car's air bags failed to deploy. Her 25-year-old fiance, Gene Erikson, who was a passenger, was killed. 
 
 She later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the wreck. But during a hearing Monday, State District Judge Teresa Drum expunged the conviction from her record, according to officials in the Van Zandt County court and Anderson's attorney, Bob Hilliard. 
 
 In a letter given to the court ahead of the hearing, an attorney for the automaker confirmed that Anderson's Saturn would have been among 2.6 million GM vehicles recalled in February to address ignition switches that can slip out of the ""run"" position, causing the engines to stall and disabling power steering, brakes and air bags. 
 
 Anderson's crash ""is one in which the recall condition may have caused or contributed to the frontal air bag non-deployment in the accident,"" attorney Richard C. Godfrey wrote. Hilliard provided a copy of the letter to The Associated Press, and Godfrey confirmed its contents Monday. 
 
 Anderson was initially charged with criminally negligent homicide because there was no clear explanation at the time why the wreck occurred, according to court documents from the case. She pleaded guilty to a letter charge in 2006, and was sentenced to five years' probation. She also was ordered to perform 260 hours of community service, pay court costs and cover the costs of Erikson's funeral. 
 
 ""GM knew this defect caused this death, yet instead of telling the truth watched silently as Candice was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter,"" Hilliard said Monday. ""It took 10 years for GM to find its voice."" 
 
 In a separate statement issued by the company, GM said it ""cooperated fully by providing technical information that was requested to make a decision in this matter."" The carmaker also said the issue in Anderson's case was for local law enforcement and courts to consider. 
 
 ""That's why we took a neutral position on Ms. Anderson's case,"" the company's statement said. ""It was appropriate for the court to determine the legal status of Ms. Anderson."" 
 
 A federal lawsuit filed against GM by Anderson and Erickson's family was dropped after the parties agreed to resolve their claims through a compensation program being run by Kenneth Feinberg, an attorney hired by GM to compensate victims of ignition switch crashes. 
 
 Feinberg released data Monday showing he has agreed to make payments in 35 death claims and 44 injury cases, up from 33 death claims last week. Feinberg has received 225 death claims and 1,955 injury claims since August. The deadline to file claims is Jan. 31, 2015.

 A Texas judge Monday cleared a driver of criminal negligent homicide in a 2004 Texas crash after a lawyer for General Motors Co. said the air bags may not have inflated because of the ignition switch defect linked to at least 35 deaths. 
 
 In 2004, Candice Anderson — then 21 — lost control of her 2004 Saturn Ion while driving down a county road in East Texas. Her fiancé, Gene Mikale Erickson, was killed when the car left the road and hit a grove of trees head on. Air bags on both driver side and and passenger side failed to deploy. 
 
 Anderson was convicted of criminal negligent homicide and paid $2,500 in fines and court costs along with performing 260 hours of community service, counseling and five years of probation. She suffered injuries including broken ribs and a injured liver. 
 
 ""Due to the wreck, and being charged with criminal negligent homicide, I lost my chosen career,"" Anderson said in a statement. ""I trained and worked as a (certified nurse's aide). I applied and was denied positions at numerous jobs due to my criminal record. ... This has not been an easy road. 
 
 Van Zandt County District Judge Teresa Drum granted Anderson's application for a writ of habeas corpus — typically the last chance a person convicted of a crime who has exhausted appeals can use to try to get a conviction expunged, said Robert Hilliard, a lawyer for Anderson. 
 
 ""GM knew this defect caused this death yet, instead of telling the truth, watched silently as Candice was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. It took 10 years for GM to find its voice. How many district attorney's around the country are now wondering if they may have sent an innocent person to prison?"" said Hilliard. ""I call on GM to double its efforts to find all victims of this defect. If there were others who were wrongfully prosecuted, GM should take affirmative and aggressive steps to have those convictions immediately overturned."" 
 
 On Monday, Hilliard released a letter from GM lawyer Richard Godfrey that confirmed ""the crash involving Ms. Anderson is one in which the recall condition may have caused or contributed to the air bag nondeployment in the accident."" 
 
 ""Candice Anderson has lived with this wrongful conviction for too long,"" Hilliard says. ""GM allowed the victim to be convicted. Now, on the day of the hearing to prove it was GM and not Candice, GM admits what it has known since 2004."" 
 
 GM spokesman Jim Cain earlier in the day said the automaker would cooperate fully with the court. ""Issues being discussed in this case are for local law enforcement and the courts to consider, and in a courtroom they are separate issues from the performance of the vehicle,"" he said. ""That's why we have taken a neutral position on Ms. Anderson's case. It is appropriate for the court to determine the legal status of Ms. Anderson."" 
 
 Cain also noted that the GM compensation program run by Kenneth Feinberg is set up to evaluate claims without consideration of contributory negligence. 
 
 Feinberg referred to a case like Anderson's when he announced GM's victim compensation program, and said he would consider a prosecution as ""extraordinary circumstances"" worthy of additional compensation. 
 
 Anderson told CNN last month she would accept a settlement from the GM victims compensation fund. ""I am ready for it to be over. I just want to move on. I don't have the endurance for a lawsuit and a long-drawn process,"" Anderson said. 
 
 In July, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. called on GM CEO Mary Barra to back a pardon and said the Justice Department may hold GM accountable for failing to make the defect known when she was prosecuted. 
 
 In July, the East Texas district attorney at the time, Leslie Poynter Dixon, wrote a letter to the Texas Board of Pardons, asking the conviction be set aside in the wake of the new information about the defect. 
 
 ""I believe (GM's defect) caused her vehicle to seize up, locking her steering and making any control of her vehicle impossible. Based upon what I now know these issues were the direct cause of the loss of control of the vehicle,"" Dixon wrote. ""It is my opinion that no action or omission of Ms. Anderson was the cause of the accident that led to her criminal charges. Had I known at the time that GM knew of these issues and has since admitted to such, I do not believe the grand jury would have indicted her.""

 After the crash on Nov. 15, 2004, Ms. Anderson’s parents liquidated their 401(k) to retain a lawyer to defend her. While a deal with prosecutors spared her jail time, she was on probation for five years and paid more than $10,000 in fines and restitution. 
 
 She also suffered serious injuries in the accident, including a lacerated liver. But the guilt surrounding her own survival and her boyfriend’s death caused her more enduring pain, she said. 
 
 When the hearing was over on Monday, Ms. Anderson, her family, and Mr. Erickson’s mother, Rhonda, went together for the first time to visit Mr. Erickson’s grave. His headstone had been put up just last week, after his mother had struggled for years with the thought of purchasing one for her only child. 
 
 Ms. Anderson placed a bouquet of red roses on the grave after withdrawing a single one from the bunch. She said she handed the single rose to Ms. Erickson. 
 
 “This will change so many things,” Ms. Anderson said in the telephone interview. 
 
 On Monday, James R. Cain, a spokesman for G.M., said in a statement: “We have taken a neutral position on Ms. Anderson’s case. It is appropriate for the court to determine the legal status of Ms. Anderson.” 
 
 The automaker’s public acknowledgment linking Ms. Anderson’s crash to the defective ignition switch came in a letter from G.M.’s lawyers that was submitted by her lawyers to the district judge in Van Zandt County, Tex.

 Until this year, she wrestled with questions about her role in Mr. Erickson’s death. The police trooper who investigated the accident had deduced that Ms. Anderson was intoxicated before her drug test results came back. His police report referred to the seemingly inexplicable circumstances of the accident, her history of recreational drug use, “and Anderson’s behavior at the scene,” which was disoriented and emotional.

 G.M. did not disclose the switch’s role when federal safety regulators asked about the cause of the crash in a so-called death inquiry. Instead, in June 2007, the automaker wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it had not assessed the cause of the crash when, in fact, it had: A G.M. engineer had found just a month earlier that power to the vehicle had most likely shut off. 
 
 The district attorney who prosecuted Ms. Anderson, Leslie Poynter Dixon, and the police trooper who investigated the accident had both said that if the ignition-switch defect had been publicly known at the time of the crash, certain details of the accident — like the lack of skid marks or evasive action — would have been seen differently. 
 
 “At the time, unbeknownst to Ms. Anderson or my office, there were issues regarding her 2004 Saturn Ion,” Ms. Poynter Dixon wrote in a letter in support of Ms. Anderson in July. “Had I known at the time that G.M. knew of these issues and has since admitted to such, I do not believe the grand jury would have indicted her for intoxication manslaughter.” 
 
 In May, The New York Times reported that General Motors considered Mr. Erickson a victim of its faulty ignition switch. Ms. Anderson learned of her accident’s inclusion in G.M.’s tally after Mr. Erickson’s mother sought confirmation from federal regulators at the request of The Times. 
 
 After Ms. Anderson’s story was first reported, her lawyer, Robert Hilliard, and federal lawmakers called on Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, to support a pardon.

 At a congressional hearing in July, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called Ms. Anderson’s indictment “a perversion of the justice process,” and asked Ms. Barra and Michael P. Millikin, G.M.’s top lawyer, to contact Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to urge a pardon for Ms. Anderson. Both declined although they offered to submit “evidence to support” Ms. Anderson’s exoneration. 
 
 On Monday, Mr. Blumenthal praised the ruling. “Her plight demonstrates just how far the consequences of General Motors’ concealment go,” he said, “hurting not just direct victims of defective cars but also those who were blamed for the accidents even when G.M. knew full well what the cause had been.”

 Ms. Anderson said she still had not heard from G.M. directly. 
 
 “I don’t expect I ever will,” she said. Ms. Anderson said she would accept a payment from the automaker’s victim compensation program run by Kenneth R. Feinberg. “My plan is to take the compensation and take this clearing of my record and move on with my life.” 
 
 Mr. Cain said that Mr. Feinberg’s compensation program “is set up to evaluate claims without consideration of contributory negligence.” 
 
 Having long worked as a home health aide and currently in pursuit of a nursing degree, Ms. Anderson said she had suffered professionally from being a convicted criminal. To be accepted to nursing school, she had to petition the Texas Board of Nursing and pay for a psychiatric examination to prove her mental stability. With her criminal record, she would have been barred from at-home caregiving and hospice work, and she had been worried about finding full-time work after graduation. 
 
 “Who wants someone taking care of their mother if they have homicide on their record?” she said. 
 
 Beyond its practical effects on her work, Ms. Anderson said her cleared record would significantly affect her life in other ways. She said that someday she would tell the story of her exoneration to her daughters, now 4 and 6. 
 
 “My heart is going to be a lot lighter to be able to tell them, ‘This is what happened, this horrible thing. And it wasn’t Mommy’s fault.’ ”","– Guilt has been the prominent emotion dogging Candice Anderson in the past decade since her fiance, Gene Erickson, was killed in a 2004 car crash while she was driving. Yesterday, some of that guilt was alleviated when a Texas judge removed the criminally negligent homicide conviction from her record after determining her Saturn Ion was one of millions of GM vehicles recalled earlier this year for an ignition switch issue, the AP reports. ""The crash involving Ms. Anderson is one in which the recall condition may have caused or contributed to the air bag nondeployment in the accident,"" a GM lawyer wrote in a letter released yesterday in Van Zandt County court. Anderson's lawyer blasted the company: ""GM knew this defect caused this death, yet, instead of telling the truth, watched silently as Candice was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter,"" he tells the Detroit News. ""This has not been an easy road,"" Anderson says in a statement cited by the News. Her parents had to empty retirement accounts to pay for her attorney, and she was forced to pony up at least $10,000 more in fines and restitution—she avoided jail time through a plea deal and served five years' probation, the New York Times reports. She was ""denied positions at numerous jobs"" due to her record, she tells the News. And she sustained serious injuries herself, though she says most of the toll has been from the guilt she's felt since that day: Until the GM problems were revealed, she anguished over what part she played in her fiance's death, the Times notes. She tells the paper that the ruling will finally enable her to tell her two young daughters, ""This is what happened, this horrible thing. And it wasn't mommy’s fault.""

On that day, a department head at UConn Health alerted UConn police, who went to Bigazzi's Burlington home to perform a well-being check. The UConn officers got no response when they knocked on the door and were soon joined by a Burlington constable and a state trooper. ||||| A 70-year-old woman was arrested for murder after her 84-year-old husband -- a University of Connecticut Health doctor and professor -- was found dead from blunt head injuries, officials said. 
 
 On Feb. 5, police responded to a home in Burlington, Connecticut, for a well-being check on Dr. Pierluigi Bigazzi, 84, and found him dead inside, Connecticut State Police said. Bigazzi's wife, Linda Kosuda-Bigazzi, was at the home and initially did not let authorities inside, according to a statement from UConn Health. 
 
 Bigazzi's death was ruled a homicide by blunt injuries to the head, the medical examiner's office told ABC News. 
 
 On Feb. 9, Kosuda-Bigazzi, 70, turned herself into police, and was charged with murder and tampering with physical evidence, state police said. 
 
 Kosuda-Bigazzi appeared in court today but did not enter a plea. Her attorney declined to comment to ABC News. She was placed on house arrest, according to The Hartford Courant. 
 
 Mark Mirko/Hartford Courant/TNS via Newscom 
 
 While Bigazzi's body was found this month, authorities believe he may have been dead for up to eight months -- a sealed court file suggests police believe he was killed between June 13, 2017, and Feb. 5, 2018, according to the Courant. The state police declined to comment further on the case, citing the ongoing investigation. 
 
 Bigazzi was a UConn Health faculty member in the School of Medicine for over 40 years ""and was an accomplished researcher and teacher in the field of pathology and laboratory medicine,"" UConn Health spokeswoman Lauren Woods said in a statement. 
 
 Kosuda-Bigazzi also worked at UConn Health from 1986 to 1998 as a science instructor and she then volunteering, helping her husband through the summer of 2017, Woods said. 
 
 Patrick Raycraft/Pool photo via AP 
 
 Bigazzi last taught in the spring of 2017, she said. 
 
 Then, in the summer of 2017, Bigazzi was assigned to update parts of the School of Medicine’s curriculum, create and update instructional materials, and develop materials for individualized learning courses, Woods said. 
 
 That work can be done ""from any location, and it was acceptable for him to work remotely,"" Woods explained in the statement. ""This is why his absence from the campus would not have been noteworthy or cause for concern.""

 Bigazzi's key card was last on the UConn Health campus in August 2017, Woods said, citing access records. His annual review would have been scheduled for later this month and ""at that time, he would have presented the work he had completed since the summer to the pathology department head for her review,"" Woods said. 
 
 In January, UConn staff tried to reach Bigazzi and never heard back, so his department alerted police who went to the home for the welfare check in February, according to the UConn statement. When police knocked on the door, Kosuda-Bigazzi initially didn't let them in, the UConn statement said. Officers later went inside and found Bigazzi's body. 
 
 State police ask anyone who had or may have had contact with Dr. Bigazzi between July 2017 and February 2018 -- including any contractors who worked at his home at that time -- to contact authorities at (860) 626-7922. ||||| UConn President Susan Herbst Wednesday ordered a review of the work arrangements for slain medical professor Pierluigi Bigazzi, whose last contact with the school was apparently last summer. 
 
 Bigazzi earned $200,000 last year at the UConn School of Medicine, but university officials have said the last time it was certain anyone at UConn saw him was May 25, 2017 at a meeting about grading related to a three-week class that ended in February 2017. 
 
 The 84-year-old professor’s body was found wrapped up in the basement of his Burlington home Friday. His wife, Linda Kosuda-Bigazzi, was arrested and charged with murder. 
 
 She is free on a $1.5 million bond. State police are investigating whether Bigazzi had been dead for months — possibly as far back as June 13, according to court documents. 
 
 “The review will examine whether relevant UConn and UConn Health policies and protocols were followed in this instance, and whether updated or new policies and protocols may be required,” Herbst said in a statement released Wednesday night. “The review will examine what the expectations of him were and what efforts were made to communicate with him.” 
 
 Bigazzi was a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the UConn medical school, which is part of UConn Health in Farmington, according to the school’s directory. He had been on the faculty since 1975, according to state records. 
 
 The May 25 meeting that Bigazzi attended could have been the last time anyone at the school saw him. The last email his department head got from him was dated July 7, according to UConn Health Center spokeswoman Lauren Woods. 
 
 Bigazzi’s key card was used for the last time on Aug. 23, although UConn officials acknowledge there is no way to know if it was Bigazzi who used it. 
 
 Bigazzi last taught a class from Jan. 24 to Feb. 13, 2017. Last summer, he was assigned to update parts of the school of medicine’s curriculum and to create and update a variety of instructional materials, Woods said. 
 
 His annual review was to be scheduled for later this month, Woods said, and he was expected to present the work he completed since summer to the head of the pathology department for review. 
 
 “Given the nature of his assignments, it was acceptable for Dr. Bigazzi to work remotely,” Woods said Wednesday. “However, it would be inappropriate for any regular full-time employee to be absent from campus and out of communication for a very lengthy period of time if they are not on sabbatical or some other form of official leave. Given that, the president instructed that this review take place.” 
 
 Herbst ordered the UConn Provost’s Office and Human Resources Department to review the circumstances surrounding Bigazzi’s work arrangements. 
 
 Linda Kusoda-Bigazzi appeared in court briefly this week and her case was continued to March 20. 
 
 The warrant for her arrest has been sealed. She is also charged with tampering with evidence.

224,"JERUSALEM/WARSAW (Reuters) - Swastikas and profanities were daubed on the entrance to Poland’s embassy in Israel on Sunday after Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Jews, as well as Poles and others, were among perpetrators of the Nazi Holocaust.

 Poland sparked international criticism over its stance on the facts of the Holocaust when it passed a law imposing jail terms for suggesting the country was complicit in the deaths of millions of Jews during the war. 
 
 At the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Morawiecki was asked by an Israeli reporter whether the reporter himself could be penalized for telling a story in Poland about his mother, who survived the Holocaust, and told him that some Poles had collaborated with the Gestapo. 
 
 In his answer, Morawiecki equated “Jewish perpetrators” with Polish, Ukrainian, Russian and German perpetrators, drawing immediate criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called his words “outrageous”. 
 
 Poland’s government said Morawiecki’s comments were not intended to deny the Holocaust or allege that Jewish victims bore responsibility for “Nazi German-perpetrated genocide”. 
 
 At the Polish embassy in Tel Aviv on Sunday, swastikas and anti-Polish profanities were found drawn in marker pen on a gate and bulletin board. Police, who released photographs of the markings, opened an investigation. 
 
 Netanyahu spoke by telephone on Sunday with Morawiecki and rejected any comparison between Polish and Jewish actions during the Holocaust, a statement issued by the Israeli prime minister’s office said. 
 
 “The aim of the Holocaust was to destroy the Jewish people and that every Jew, everywhere, was facing a death sentence,” it quoted Netanyahu as saying. 
 
 Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart agreed to continue to pursue a dialogue on the new law, and that teams from both sides would meet soon, the statement said. 
 
 Some 3 million Jews who lived in pre-war Poland were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of all Jews killed in the Holocaust. 
 
 Jews from across the continent were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by Germans in occupied Poland — home to Europe’s biggest Jewish community at the time — including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. 
 
 Thousands of Poles risked their lives to protect Jewish neighbors during the war. But research published since the fall of communism in 1989 showed that thousands also killed Jews or denounced those who hid them to the Nazi occupiers, challenging the national narrative that Poland was solely a victim. 
 
 According to figures from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis, who invaded Poland in 1939, also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians. 
 
 “Attempts to equate the crimes of Nazi German perpetrators with the actions of their victims — Jewish, Polish, Romani among others — who struggled for survival should be met with resolute, outright condemnation,” the Polish government’s statement also said. ||||| Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned as “outrageous” his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki’s remark Saturday that Jewish perpetrators were also responsible for the Holocaust. 
 
 “The Polish prime minister’s remarks here in Munich are outrageous,” said Netanyahu, who is also in Germany for a security conference. 
 
 “There is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people. I intend to speak with him forthwith,” Netanyahu said in a statement from Munich.

 Addressing the Munich Security Conference earlier, Morawiecki was rejecting criticism of a new law that criminalizes mentions of Polish state complicity in the Holocaust, when he was asked by an Israeli journalist if sharing his family’s history of persecution in Poland would be outlawed under the new legislation. 
 
 “Of course it’s not going to be punishable, [it’s] not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian; not only German perpetrators,” Morawiecki told Yedioth Ahronoth’s Ronen Bergman.

 Morawiecki’s was harshly criticized by opposition lawmakers. 
 
 “Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki talks like the last of the Holocaust deniers. The blood of millions of Jews cries out from the ground in Poland over the distortion of history and escape from blame,” tweeted party leader Avi Gabbay. 
 
 “Jews were murdered in the Holocaust and Poles took an active part in their murder. The Israeli government must be here for the millions murdered and strongly condemn the Polish prime minister’s words,” he said. 
 
 Tzipi Livni, a Zionist Union MK and former foreign minister who was in the audience, said it was “moving to hear Ronen Bergman asking/attacking the Polish prime minister over the law that forbids mentioning the participation of the Polish nation in the Holocaust, as [Bergman] told his family story and received applause from the audience.” 
 
 Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, one of the most vocal Israeli critics of the Polish law, said Morawiecki’s statement is “anti-Semitism of the oldest kind.” 
 
 “The perpetrators are not the victims. The Jewish state will not allow the murdered to be blamed for their own murder,” he said, while calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to recall Israel’s ambassador to Warsaw. 
 
 The Polish Prime Minister’s statement is antisemitism of the oldest kind. The perpetrators are not the victims. The Jewish state will not allow the murdered to be blamed for their own murder. I again call upon the Prime Minister to immediately recall our Ambassador to Israel. — יאיר לפיד (@yairlapid) February 17, 2018 
 
 Zionist Union MK Ksenia Svetlova said Morawiecki’s remark “shows his true face.” 
 
 “It should be remembered that according to the most conservative estimate 200,000 Jews in Poland were murdered by Poles,” she tweeted, adding that “the crisis with Poland is only getting worse and there is no room here for compromises.” 
 
 “If we don’t stand up for the truth, no will do it for us.” 
 
 Fellow Zionist Union MK Itzik Shmuli also criticized the Polish prime minister, saying the next phase in his “pathetic project” would be “blaming the Jews for their own Holocaust.” 
 
 probably the next step of Morawiecki’s pathetic project to erasing the crimes of the Polish is going to be blaming the Jews for their own Holocaust and presenting the Nazis as victims of the circumstances.He would have to sue the 6M victims Jews+my state????????before it will happen! https://t.co/wKmDv470Tq — איציק שמולי (@ishmuli) February 17, 2018 
 
 In response to Bergman’s question, Morawiecki said the new law aimed to prevent falsely attributing Nazi crimes in Poland under Nazi occupation to Polish government policy at the time. He said that last year Polish embassies had to respond 260 times to statements referring to “Polish death camps.” 
 
 He said the Polish people generally aided their “Jewish brothers and sisters” during the war, and that the lines between Holocaust victims and perpetrators were becoming increasingly blurred. 
 
 The legislation prescribes prison time for using phrases such as “Polish death camps” to refer to the killing sites Nazi Germany operated in occupied Poland during World War II. Its provisions run wider, however: 
 
 “Whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reich… or other crimes against peace and humanity, or war crimes, or otherwise grossly diminishes the actual perpetrators thereof, shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years,” a translation of a key paragraph of the bill reads. 
 
 The legislation sparked outrage in Israel, with some lawmakers accusing the Polish government of outright Holocaust denial. 
 
 The dispute has elicited bitter recriminations on both sides. Some Israelis have accused the mostly Catholic Poles of being driven by anti-Semitism and of trying to deny the Holocaust. Poles believe that they are being defamed by being linked to German crimes, of which they were one of the largest group of victims. 
 
 Israel, along with several international Holocaust organizations and many critics in Poland, argues that the law could have a chilling effect on debating history, harming freedom of expression and leading to a whitewashing of Poland’s wartime history. 
 
 Netanyahu has pilloried the law as “distortion of the truth, the rewriting of history, and the denial of the Holocaust.” 
 
 Amid the dispute some Polish commentators, including in government-controlled media, have made strong anti-Jewish remarks. 
 
 In one instance, the head of a state-run channel suggested referring to Auschwitz as a “Jewish death camp,” in response to an outcry over use of the term “Polish death camp” to describe the Nazi killing site in German-occupied Poland. 
 
 Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.","– Swastikas and profanity were reportedly scrawled on the property of the Polish embassy in Israel over the weekend in the wake of controversial remarks made by the country's prime minister about the Holocaust. The symbol of hate appeared on the entrance to the property in Tel Aviv on Sunday, one day after Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki publicly suggested that Jews, along with Poles and others, were among those responsible for aiding the Nazi genocide, Reuters reports. An estimated 3 million Jewish people living in Poland are believed to have been murdered by the Nazis prior to World War II.

225,"SEOUL—A top LG Electronics Inc. executive has been indicted by Seoul prosecutors for allegedly vandalizing several high-end washing machines manufactured by rival Samsung Electronics Co. 
 
 An LG Electronics spokeswoman said Sunday that Jo Seong-jin, head of the company’s home-appliance division, has been indicted on charges of deliberately damaging four Samsung “Crystal Blue” washing machines ahead of a trade show in Germany last September. Mr. Jo has also been charged with defamation and obstruction of business, she said. 
 
 ... ||||| Screenshot by CNET Korea 
 
 Following the indictment of one of its senior executives for vandalism of rival Samsung's washing machines, LG has denied all wrongdoing and posted the allegedly damning CCTV footage of the act to YouTube. 
 
 The footage, LG says, proves that the executive in question was testing, rather than sabotaging, South Korean rival Samsung's washing machines. Samsung claims the footage is ""arbitrarily edited."" 
 
 The move follows South Korean prosecutors' indictment of Jo Seong-jin, head of LG's Home Appliance and Air Solution company, and two other LG employees on charges they wilfully damaged rival Samsung's washing machines during the IFA tradeshow in Berlin last year. Samsung instigated the investigations by filing suit against LG for property damages and defamation. LG denied the charges and counter-sued Samsung for defamation and tampering evidence, but the prosecutors have declined to follow this counter-suit, citing lack of evidence. 
 
 The video, embedded below and entitled ""This is LG Electronics' Jo Seong-jin,"" includes CCTV footage that shows Jo and his employees in three separate encounters with a Samsung Crystal Blue Door front-load washing machine, with accompanying explanations by LG. LG alleges this is the footage turned over to the prosecution by Samsung during the investigation. 
 
 LG says that Samsung's allegations are based on the second encounter, where Jo is shown to be bending his knees and pushing down on the door of the washing machine with his hands, with what looks like visible force. LG claimed that Jo was performing standard product tests, out of habit as an engineer, and the footage was accompanied and followed by images that showed people from non-LG home appliance and home-shopping companies pushing down on the door in a similar fashion. 
 
 It also showed images of what looked to be regular consumers -- IFA is open to the public -- using the door roughly, such as hanging a hefty looking blanket on the door, or leaning on the door while taking the laundry out. A child was also seen sitting on the door. 
 
 LG also pointed out that Jo tested other products besides the washing machine on display at the Samsung store, in full view of Samsung promoters who checked on the condition of the appliances and did not ask Jo to stop. That Jo conducted the ""test"" in the open, with Samsung employees as witnesses, made Samsung's claim of him ""secretly sabotaging"" the washing machine preposterous, LG said. 
 
 Near the end of the video, LG showed images of what it claimed are results from its re-enactment of the testing. LG concluded that the same testing could not cause as much damage as Samsung said had occurred, with a not-so-subtle suggestion that Samsung may have tempered with the washing machine, which was airlifted from Berlin to be turned in as evidence to prosecution. 
 
 In the latest statement, LG's Jo apologized for the situation itself, which he called ""unnecessary controversy,"" but again proclaimed his innocence. 
 
 Sources familiar with the matter told CNET's sister site ZDNet Korea that Samsung and LG execs met earlier this year in a meeting that was not made public, under the mediation of the prosecution, to possibly settle the issue. The talks fell through, however, as LG declined to apologize for what it claims it did not do. 
 
 Samsung in a statement claimed the video was ""arbitrarily edited"" and distorts the truth. ""The prosecution has already sufficiently examined the entire video, not the edited version, and has determined that there is enough suspicion of willfully damaging, so we have decided that just because LG Electronics posted a video it would be inappropriate for us to release the entire video as tit-for-tat,"" a spokesperson for Samsung said. 
 
 Samsung also claimed that its employees, not seen in the video, were at a distance and looking in a different direction when Jo was damaging the washing machine, and were therefore unable to protest. It also said Jo's actions shown in the video, when performed by a healthy adult such as himself, ""clearly"" broke the bounds of conventional testing. 
 
 An LG spokesman said there was nothing to add to the statement the company released and the video it posted.","– Jo Seong-jin, a top exec for LG Electronics, has been accused of vandalizing washing machines made by rival company Samsung. He and two other LG executives have been indicted over the incident, an LG spokesperson tells the Wall Street Journal. Before a trade show in Germany last September, Samsung said LG execs had broken the doors of four of its washing machines at Berlin shopping centers. LG said Jo, the head of its home appliance division, and other execs were indeed surveying the competition, but insisted any broken Samsung doors were caused only by subpar hinges. Even so, LG paid for the damaged appliances, but Samsung filed a lawsuit anyway. LG countersued for defamation and evidence tampering, and then South Korean prosecutors got involved. In December, prosecutors raided LG offices and temporarily banned Jo from traveling outside the country. Mediation attempts were unsuccessful, and Jo has now been charged with not just the allegedly deliberate damage but with defamation and obstruction of business, the LG rep says. In response to the indictment, LG has released footage of Jo performing what it calls ""standard product tests"" on the Samsung machines as Samsung promoters were in the room, CNET reports; the footage also shows other consumers handling the doors in a less than gentle fashion. But Samsung says the footage has been ""arbitrarily edited."" Says Jo's lawyer: ""It is questionable whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that the president of a global company deliberately destroyed the machines where employees of the competing company were present. The truth will be revealed in the courts.""","<pad> – LG Electronics has been accused of vandalizing Samsung's washing machines, reports CNET Korea. The company has denied all wrongdoing and posted CCTV footage of the incident to YouTube, which shows Jo Seong-jin, head of the company's home appliance division, in three separate encounters with a Samsung washing machine. The video shows Jo bending his knees and pushing down on the door of the washing machine with his hands, with what looks like visible force.

 Japan has already deployed Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile batteries in Tokyo, as well as in Okinawa and at locations along the northern and western coasts facing the Korean Peninsula.

 New satellite images released on Friday indicate that snow may have slowed the preparations, but Pyongyang shouuld still be ready for liftoff starting on Monday. 
 
 Pyongyang claims the launch is an attempt to put an earth-observation satellite into orbit. But analysts and foreign governments share the belief that the it is part of North Korea’s development of long-range missiles. 
 
 The head of US forces in Japan, Lt. Gen. Salvatore Angelella, said on Thursday that the launch threatens the stability of the region. 
 
 “This is a very dangerous situation and we do not support those actions by North Korea,” he said. “We are monitoring the situation closely.” 
 
 The government and military forces in South Korea have been placed on heightened alert, while the Philippines has expressed “serious concern” that the missile will violate resolution by the United Nations Security Council and called on Pyongyang “to reconsider its planned launch and abide by these resolutions, which call for the abandonment of its ballistic missile programme in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.”","– If, after its firing, any piece of North Korea's rocket appears likely to fall in Japanese territory, Tokyo is ready to shoot it from the sky.

227,"Apple has begun a super-secret quest for a store in historic Grand Central Terminal, potentially creating a hive of buzzing techies in the glamorous Beaux Arts landmark. 
 
 Reliable sources tell The Observer that the maker of ubiquitous iGadgets–from computers to cell phones–hopes to open a store in the transportation and retail hub, though it has yet to begin the long approval process necessary for opening in a city landmark. 
 
 Apple wields a famously iron fist over all its major announcements and has been rumored to back out of deals if anyone speaks to the press. To wit, when contacted by The Observer, most of the parties potentially involved wouldn’t even blink twice for yes, although they tellingly would not deny it either. 
 
 Friendly receptionists became suddenly cagey when we dropped the A-bomb. “We’re not authorized to speak about that,” said the woman who answered the phone for Grand Central‘s leasing agent, Williams Jackson Ewing. Likewise, a lovely Southerner at Dallas-based Open Realty, which represents Apple, sighed almost imperceptibly and noted that Apple’s broker, Jonathan A. Siegel, is away on business. 
 
 For its part, MTA Real Estate/ Retail+Leasing division, which will have the final word on any new store, offered this careful response: “We select tenants through a public process that features a formal request for proposals,” said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the MTA. “We don’t comment on prospective tenants outside of the process. Robert K. Futterman, which handled Apple’s first three New York spaces, declined to comment. 
 
 Apple, unsurprisingly, said the company hadn’t made an announcement about a new store. 
 
 The riddle remains: Where can you put a phalanx of high-tech gadgets and hundreds of techies and tourists alike in historic Grand Central? Banana Republic and Kenneth Cole, which have stores fronting 42nd Street, have leases expiring, according to one broker, but the store is not expected to take those spaces. Instead, it sounds like the company plans to put its high-tech shrine right in the terminal. 
 
 Apple is most famous for its glass cube on Fifth Avenue (the fifth most-photographed site in New York City) and a similar store on the Upper West Side. But the company also has a track record of historically sensitive design: namely, its first New York store, inside a Soho post office, its warehouse store in the Meatpacking District, and one in historic Georgetown, in Washington, D.C. Neither the Landmarks Preservation Commission nor the architect of its previous stores, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, have been contacted by Apple. 
 
 SLIDESHOW: Apple’s Last Stop? Grand Central 
 
 lkusisto@observer.com 
 
 Follow Laura Kusisto via RSS. ||||| Apple will be building a massive store in New York’s Grand Central Terminal, we have independently confirmed. 
 
 The store will open in the fall, likely early September — and it will be Apple’s largest retail space in the world. 
 
 The store already has a name: Apple Store, Grand Central, according to a source close the company. The source said Apple will be making an internal announcement within the next month or so. 
 
 “The company will certainly pull out all the stops on this one,” said the source, who asked not to be named. 
 
 This year is the 10th anniversary of Apple retail, and Apple wants to make a big splash, our source said. Apple’s retail operation has been a spectacular success, helping fuel the company’s explosive growth and creating shops that make twice as much money as Tiffany & Co. 
 
 
 
 Reports that Apple was looking at the New York landmark first appeared last week in The New York Observer and IFOAppleStore.com. Both publications said Apple was “evaluating” Grand Central but hadn’t started the long and complex approval process, which is overseen by New York’s bureaucratic MTA. 
 
 The Apple Store, Grand Central, will be the largest in the world. It will be bigger than the Apple Store in Covent Garden, London, currently Apple’s largest retail location. The Covent Garden store is about 40,000 square feet over four stories, but only 16,372 square feet is public, according to IFOAppleStore. 
 
 It’s unclear where Apple will find more than 16,000 square feet inside Grand Central. 
 
 The terminal is home to more than 100 retail locations, spread across three levels and 130,000 square feet. Most average between 1,000 and 6,000 square feet. One of the largest stores is Rite Aid at 10,000 square feet, followed by Kenneth Cole, which has about 8,500 square feet next to the iconic Vanderbilt Hall. Here’s the leasing plan (pdf). 
 
 The Observer said Apple isn’t expected to take one of the traditional retail spaces, but will locate right in the terminal. 
 
 Our source suggested that Apple may be taking walls down — but didn’t elaborate. 
 
 The terminal sees more than 700,000 visitors a day, most heading for trains or subway. But about 250,000 come to look at Vanderbilt Hall or eat at the 35 restaurants, including the historic Oyster Bar on the lower level. 
 
 Apple already operates four super-popular stores in Manhattan. The largest is the spectacular glass-fronted store on the Upper West Side. The busiest is the famous glass cube on Fifth Avenue. The Fifth Ave. store is only a mile away from Grand Central. In fact, the mad crowds at Fifth Ave. is the reason Apple wants another store so close, to take the pressure off, according IFOAppleStore. ||||| Big Apple, indeed. 
 
 Not content to have the highest-grossing store on the world’s most expensive street, Apple is set to open a gargantuan retail outlet inside Grand Central Terminal, the massive train station in the heart of Manhattan, according to a new report. 
 
 Rumors of the deal have been circulating for a few days, but Apple sleuth Leander Kahney says he’s confirmed that Apple will be opening the store sometime in the fall, most likely in early September. 
 
 If true, I think it’s fair to say that this deal would represent a vote of confidence in New York City’s economic recovery. 
 
 It would also reflect a change in the nature of Grand Central, a beloved, 140-year-old landmark on 42nd Street, turning it from essentially a transit point — albeit a gorgeous one — with scattered retail, into a full-fledged shopping destination. 
 
 The move would help alleviate the immense traffic at Apple’s flagship store on Fifth Avenue. For years now, it’s been increasingly difficult to do business there in a timely way, except for late at night. On weekends and over holidays, the store is virtually impassible, clogged by throngs of tourists from around the globe. 
 
 Kahney says the outlet will become the largest Apple retail location in the world and be called Apple Store, Grand Central. At present, the largest Apple store is the Covent Garden location in London, which measures in at 16,732 square feet of publicly accessible space. 
 
 Last time I checked, there wasn’t a 16,000 square-foot chunk of unoccupied retail space inside Grand Central, through which 700,000 people — mostly commuters — travel each weekday. 
 
 However, and this is pure speculation, one possible candidate could be the retail spaces surrounding and below Vanderbilt Hall, the huge room on the 42nd Street side that used to be the station’s waiting area. It’s currently used for seasonal events, art shows, etc. (Wall Street bank Bear Stearns once set up a squash court there). 
 
 Here’s the leasing plan [.pdf] via Kahney. 
 
 Reached for comment, an Apple spokesperson told Wired.com: “We have not made any announcements about a store at that location. Anything else is rumor and speculation.”

 Daniels is already embroiled in litigation with the president and his lawyer, Michael Cohen, over a 2016 deal in which she agreed to keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006. Daniels got $130,000 from Cohen and sued to get out of the agreement. 
 
 She claimed in interviews that in 2011, after she agreed to cooperate with a magazine about an article, she was threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot by a man to keep quiet about her tryst with Trump. Daniels’s lawyer released a composite sketch of the man on April 17. 
 
 Trump dismissed the claim in an April 18 Twitter posting: “A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!"" 
 
 Tracking Trump: Follow the administration’s every move 
 
 In her lawsuit, Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, says Trump’s statement in effect accuses her of committing a crime under New York law by saying she falsely accused an individual of committing a crime against her. 
 
 “Mr. Trump used his national and international audience of millions of people to make a false factual statement to denigrate and attack Ms. Clifford,” according to her claim. 
 
 Trump has about 51.4 million followers on Twitter. 
 
 Daniels is seeking more than $75,000 in damages, saying she has been exposed to death threats and had to hire bodyguards to ensure her safety. 
 
 Representatives for the Trump administration didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 
 Daniels said her ex-husband approached In Touch magazine, without her approval, about her relationship with Trump. She said she agreed to help with the article ""only after being told the magazine was going to be running the story with or without her cooperation."" 
 
 She said she was then approached by the man in Las Vegas, who looked at Daniels’s infant daughter and said “it’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.” Daniels said she didn’t report the incident to police. 
 
 Daniels claims Cohen had the In Touch story killed, using threats and intimidation. 
 
 Since very few people knew about the possible magazine story, Daniels said it’s reasonable to infer that the person who threatened her “could have only been acting directly or indirectly on behalf of Mr. Trump and/or Mr. Cohen.”

 Adult film star Stormy Daniels has filed a defamation suit against President Donald Trump for a tweet that said a forensic sketch of a man who allegedly threatened her in 2011 was ""a total con job."" 
 
 Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was warned by an unidentified man to keep quiet about it five years later, after she gave an interview to a gossip magazine. 
 
 A sketch of the man Stormy Daniels says threatened her and her infant daughter in 2011 inside a Las Vegas parking garage. Michael Avenatti 
 
 Earlier this month, Clifford worked with a forensic artist to create a sketch of the man she says accosted her in a Las Vegas parking lot, told her, ""Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,"" and ominously suggested something bad could happen to her. 
 
 The lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan centers on an April 18 post on Trump's Twitter account in which he reacts to another person's tweet about the sketch. 
 
 ""A sketch years later about a nonexistent man,"" Trump's post said. ""A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!"" 
 
 The suit alleges Trump's comment amounts to an accusation that Clifford fabricated the threat and exposed her to ridicule and violent threats. 
 
 ""Mr. Trump used his national and international audience of millions of people to make a false factual statement to denigrate and attack Ms. Clifford,"" the complaint says. 
 
 Trump's attorney had no immediate comment on the defamation claim. 
 
 Read Stormy Daniels' defamation lawsuit 
 
 Clifford's attorney, Michael Avenatti, said, ""Regardless of who you are or what position you hold, you are not permitted to fabricate statements in an effort to deceive people. There are consequences for doing that."" 
 
 The case was assigned to Judge Jesse Furman, who issued a summons for Trump on Tuesday. Furman, a former prosecutor who was nominated by President Obama, has been on the federal bench since 2012. He recently dismissed a harassment lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein by his personal assistant on the grounds that the court didn't have jurisdiction. 
 
 This is the second lawsuit that Clifford has filed against Trump. Earlier this year she sued him and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to dissolve a confidentiality agreement she signed days before the 2016 election in exchange for $130,000. 
 
 Last week, a federal judge put the earlier suit on hold for 90 days because Cohen is now under federal investigation in connection with the payment to Clifford. 
 
 The White House has said Clifford's allegations are false. 
 
 ""I've had conversations with the president about this,"" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in March. ""And as I outlined earlier, that this case had already been won in arbitration, and that there was no knowledge of any payments from the president and he's denied all of these allegations."" 
 
 Earlier this month, aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters that he didn't know about the $130,000 payment to Clifford and said they should ask Cohen. Cohen has said that he paid the hush money out of his own funds and was not repaid by the Trump campaign or Trump Organization — though he has not explicitly said Trump himself didn't repay it. 
 
 Last week, during a live interview, Trump appeared to acknowledge that Cohen was representing him in the payment arrangement. 
 
 ""He represents me like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me,"" Trump said in a phone call to ""Fox and Friends."" 
 
 Clifford underwent a polygraph test in 2011, and the examiner concluded she was telling the truth when she said she and Trump had unprotected sex in 2006. She took the exam at the request of a magazine that interviewed her about the encounter but didn't publish a story about it at the time. 
 
 She contends the confidentiality pact she signed in 2016 is invalid because Trump didn't sign it. Lawyers for Cohen and Trump say the president was not a party to the agreement, so his signature wasn't required. ||||| Adult-film star Stormy Daniels has filed a defamation suit against President Trump Donald John TrumpEx-Russia ambassador: Trump has done more damage to NATO in months than Russia has in decades Trump takes credit for increased defense spending by NATO allies, but says 'it isn't nearly enough' Trump questions how Russia probe can 'proceed' given FBI agent's private comments MORE in addition to her ongoing one against his personal attorney, Michael Cohen. 
 
 Daniels's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, tweeted Monday that his client has filed the lawsuit for Trump's ""irresponsible and defamatory statements"" about Daniels, whom Cohen paid $130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement weeks before the 2016 election. 
 
 The complaint alleges that Trump's tweets mocking Daniels over a forensic sketch of a man she says threatened her to keep quiet about her claims of an affair with the president amount to defamation because they accuse her of fabricating the alleged crime, which would itself be illegal.

 Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is seeking damages in excess of $75,000, claiming that in posting the tweets, Trump knew that Daniels ""would be subjected to threats of violence, economic harm, and reputational damage.""

 Daniels claimed in a “60 Minutes” interview last month that in 2011 a man approached her and her infant daughter in a parking lot and threatened her not to speak about the alleged affair. 
 
 “He leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That’s a beautiful little girl,' ” Daniels said. “ 'It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.” 
 
 In response to the forensic sketch Daniels released, Trump tweeted that the situation was “a total con job,” and shared a tweet that compared the sketch to a photo of Daniels’s ex-husband, suggesting that the two are the same person.

 Cohen has requested and on Friday received a 90-day stay in Daniels's lawsuit against him, following the FBI raids on his office, home and hotel room earlier this month. 
 
 Last week, Cohen invoked his Fifth Amendment rights in the suit, saying he could not effectively defend himself because it might incriminate him in the federal case.

 It seems President Donald Trump‘s re-election campaign has come up with their first ad for 2020, and it involves you calling the president, giving your thanks and singing his praises. 
 
 Yes, really. 
 
 Campaign manager Brad Parscale narrates the ad, asking people to get on their phones and “deliver a personal thank you” to Trump for making America great again or whatever. 
 
 “We need to let President Trump know that we appreciate what he’s doing for America,” Parscale said. “I need you to call the number on your screen and deliver a thank you to President Trump.” 
 
 The rest of it was…well, just watch above.

 Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Less than three seconds into an ad for President Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, Brad Parscale repeats a claim his boss makes regularly: “President Trump has achieved more during his time in office than any president in history.” Visuals flash on screen of Trump signing legislation in the Oval Office and applauding during the swearing-in ceremony for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. 
 
 Then, Parscale, the president’s 2020 campaign manager, asks Trump supporters to call their commander in chief to give thanks for all the work he’s done, according to a video of a TV ad shared Monday night. 
 
 “That is why I need every Trump supporter to pick up a phone right now and deliver a personal thank you to your president,” says Parscale, wearing an electric blue suit with a matching tie and “Thin Blue Line” flag lapel pin in support of the “Blue Lives Matter” movement. 
 
 But really, Parscale continues, call and say thank you to Trump. 
 
 “We need to let President Trump know that we appreciate what he’s doing for America,” he says later in the ad. “I need you to call the number on your screen and deliver a thank you to President Trump.”

I called the number and it leads to a fundraising appeal (not unusual for pres campaigns) pic.twitter.com/yB3Rb1pJKe — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) December 18, 2018 
 
 The video of the ad was first shared by journalist Yashar Ali shortly before 9 p.m. Monday. As of early Tuesday, the video has been viewed on Twitter more than 127,000 times. 
 
 Ali tweeted that the ad ran on CNN, though it’s unclear whether the campaign spot was seen on its national broadcast or if it ran locally. Ali told The Washington Post that he saw the ad in the Southern California area toward the end of “Anderson Cooper 360.” Parscale and CNN did not immediately return requests for comment. 
 
 The campaign spot is one of the first indications of what the president’s reelection campaign might look like against whomever emerges from the Democratic field to challenge him in 2020. The timing of the ad comes less than two years into his presidency, and also during a stretch in which almost every organization Trump has led in the last 10 years is under investigation. 
 
 [Mounting legal threats surround Trump as nearly every organization he has led is under investigation] 
 
 In a one-minute ad littered with visuals of factory workers, campaign events and the American flag, Parscale, 42, touts “a booming economy” and “historic low unemployment.” When he adds that the jobs situation under Trump includes “the lowest unemployment rate for minorities in history,” an image of a black female factory employee hard at work pops up on the screen. 
 
 Toward the end of the ad, which shows an excited Trump gazing at falling confetti from a Christmas-themed rally in Florida last year, a trio of supporters each offer an enthusiastic, “Thank you, President Trump!” 
 
 “President Trump needs to hear from his supporters,” a narrator says in a booming voice. 
 
 As is customary for campaign ads, Trump’s voice comes on at the end to say that he approves the message, with text underneath that reads, “Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.” 
 
 So, what happens when someone calls the number listed in the ad? A prompt urges you to state your name and leave a brief message for the president, thanking him for his work. Then Parscale appeals for donations to Trump’s campaign. He again praises the strength of the economy, citing “lower regulations, massive tax cuts and renegotiated trade deals that put America first.” 
 
 After talking about how “enforcing our immigration laws are making Americans safer,” Parscale takes another page out of Trump’s playbook and points his attention toward the media and Democrats. 
 
 “But President Trump is under vicious, daily attacks from the fake news media and far-left Democrats who want to implement the radical socialist agenda,” Parscale continues in the recording. “They will stop at nothing to overturn the election and remove your president from office.” 
 
 [How Brad Parscale, once a ‘nobody in San Antonio,’ shaped Trump’s combative politics and rose to his inner circle] 
 
 Callers are given a prompt that allows them to choose to donate (press 1) or continue (press 2). If they choose to continue instead of donating, Parscale comes back on the line and pleads his case one more time. 
 
 “I understand a contribution is a lot to ask for, but President Trump is asking for your support now, before it’s too late,” he urges. “We must protect the Trump presidency for the American people.” 
 
 While it’s rare for an incumbent or candidate, let alone a sitting president, to prominently feature a member of their campaign staff in a political ad, it isn’t totally unprecedented. When it happened in 2011, in fact, the TV spot went viral. Mark Block, the chief of staff for Herman Cain’s 2012 presidential campaign, made his case for his candidate’s place as the Republican nominee in an impassioned address that ended with a close-up shot of him smoking a cigarette. The ad concluded with another tight shot of a grinning Cain with “I Am America,” an anti-establishment anthem popular with the tea party at the time, playing as the screen faded to black. 
 
 Even before Cain’s failed attempt to win the 2012 GOP nomination, Block’s smoking shot would become one of the most bizarre, and viral, ads in the history of presidential campaigns. “Never thought twice about the fact that I smoke,” Block told the Sacramento Bee in 2012, calling the ad “historic.” 
 
 Some Trump critics and pundits were quick to mock Parscale and Trump’s new ad on Twitter.

 Rick Wilson, the Republican political strategist and prominent Never Trump pundit, suggested another line that didn’t make the thank-you ad. 
 
 “Also, ‘And ladies, if you’re hot, leave little sumthing in Don’s voicemail,' ” Wilson tweeted.","– In what Mediaite says appears to be the first 2020 ad for President Trump's re-election campaign, supporters hear an unusual request. Campaign chief Brad Parscale asks them to call an 800 number and leave a personal message of thanks for the president. ""We need to let President Trump know that we appreciate what he's doing for America,"" Parscale says. ""I need you to call the number on your screen and deliver a thank-you to President Trump."" You can see the ad via this tweet from journalist Yashar Ali, who spotted it on CNN Monday night. ""President Trump has achieved more during his time in office than any president in history,"" says Parscale. This being a campaign ad, another motive is at play: money. The Washington Post punched in the number and found that callers do indeed get a prompt to record their message. Then comes a plea for a donation, followed by a second one if callers disregard the first. ""I understand a contribution is a lot to ask for, but President Trump is asking for your support now, before it's too late,"" Parscale says. ""We must protect the Trump presidency for the American people."" (The number of potential Democratic candidates keeps growing.)","<pad> – It's a minute long, and it's a minute long. Campaign manager Brad Parscale tells CNN that he's asking Trump supporters to call their commander in chief to give thanks for all the work he's done. ""That is why I need every Trump supporter to pick up a phone right now and deliver a personal thank you to your president,"" he says.

230,"Some consular staff of the real US Embassy in Ghana would be sacked after security officials discovered and shut down a fake Embassy that has been operating for 10 years and issuing genuine US visas in the country at a cost of $6000. 
 
 Genuine visas can only be issued when there is an inside job. 
 
 The fake embassy also reportedly issued visas to other European countries, as well as counterfeit documents. 
 
 It is not clear when the criminals were busted but the information was posted on the Department of State’s website on November 2, 2016, the news however, went viral only after ghanabusinessnews.com broke it Friday evening December 2. 
 
 While US Embassy officials won’t comment because they say investigation of the matter is ongoing, ghanabusinessnews.com can say on authority that some staff of the consular section would be fired. 
 
 A source familiar with Department of State processes told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees found culpable in the crime would simply be recalled and no reasons would be assigned, and Embassy staff wouldn’t even know about it. 
 
 It appears that’s how diplomatic missions handle offences by staff. Ghanabusinessnews.com is familiar with a similar incident at the Embassy of a European country in Ghana. There was a visa scandal at this Embassy in 2012, and the Ambassador was quietly recalled, and no reason was assigned. Some staff didn’t even know why. 
 
 A source who wasn’t authorized to speak to the media told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees at the said Embassy apparently were engaged in illegal issuance of visas, and the travellers were arrested at the country’s entry point. The travellers were caught because that country had joined a new visa system, and had changed its visas. But these travellers had the visa from the old system. 
 
 In an unprecedented move in 2006, Switzerland recalled its entire diplomatic staff including the ambassador from its Karachi mission when it was discovered that there was a massive visa fraud in its Islamabad Embassy, and visas for Pakistanis were halted at that time. 
 
 The fake US Embassy operating somewhere in Accra, was issuing genuine visas, the security team that closed it down said. They also found that a Ghanaian immigration lawyer working with some Turkish and other Ghanaian citizens was involved with the active connivance of Ghana law enforcement officers, who were apparently bribed to look the other way. 
 
 Visa acquisition in Ghana 
 
 Applying for visas in Ghana is a dreadful experience for any prospective traveller. The consular sections of almost all Embassies demand for proofs like birth certificate, bank statements, invitation letters, some with additional photocopies of hosts, and in some instances even their bank statements. 
 
 After providing all these, the Embassies demand that prospective travellers submit their applications in person and in most cases go through an interview, and yet many known qualified prospective travellers with no intention of remaining in these countries are denied visas. 
 
 There was a famous case of a medical professional that was invited to present a paper at a conference in Spain but was denied visa on the flimsy excuse that he didn’t satisfy the conditions for a visa, which in most cases means that the applicant is not likely to return to Ghana. 
 
 This medical expert then responded by writing a copious open letter to the Spanish Embassy in Ghana. 
 
 Connection men 
 
 Due to the frustrating experience in acquiring a visa to travel, especially to Europe and the US, the phenomena of connection men has sprung up. While anyone familiar with visa issuance processes would disbelieve the effectiveness of these connection men to whom prospective travellers pay huge sums of money for visas, these incidents of the fake US Embassy and the example of the European country’s embassy in Ghana emphatically confirm that insiders work with these connection men to issue visas. 
 
 Human trafficking 
 
 This fake US Embassy that operated for 10 years, which category of travellers was it serving? Could they have issued visas to human traffickers? Because $6000 is a colossal amount that very few ordinary travellers can afford. It would therefore, not be out of place to assume that most of the clients of this criminal gang were human traffickers. 
 
 The crime of human trafficking is a lucrative illegal business generating an amount of $150 billion every year for traffickers.

 For a decade, an American flag flew outside a battered pink building in Ghana’s capital city, welcoming out-of-town visitors who, once inside, found a photo of President Obama hanging on the wall. Signs confirmed to travelers — who had been bused in from the most remote parts of West Africa — that they had arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Accra. 
 
 The “consular officers” working there were not Americans, but they spoke English and Dutch and issued official-looking visas and identification papers. They charged their customers $6,000. 
 
 Billboards and fliers advertised the official services. 
 
 But there was nothing official about them. The real U.S. Embassy in Accra is white, not pink, and it sits on a large piece of land inside security fences in one of the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods. 
 
 The battered building with the flag and Obama picture was a fake — ran by Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian lawyer practicing immigration and criminal law, the State Department said in a statement. 
 
 “For about a decade it operated unhindered,” the statement said. “The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored.” 
 
 Officials said they shut down the fraudulent operation during the summer after an informant tipped off the assistant investigator for the Regional Security Office. The investigation in Ghana stemmed from a larger State Department initiative, Operation Spartan Vanguard, which was created by the RSO to “address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region,” according to the statement.

 The State Department released information about the investigation Nov. 2, but the news is being widely reported only now. The story seems to have been first reported by Ghanaian media last week, and it cites the statement from one month ago on the State Department website. The information was not contained in a news release from the State Department or its Bureau of Diplomatic Security, but in a “behind the scenes” article written by diplomatic security staff. 
 
 In it, officials did not say how many people, if any, may have entered the United States illegally with documentation from the fake embassy or how the crime ring got hold of what the state department called “fraudulently obtained, legitimate U.S. visas.” 
 
 State Department officials in Ghana deferred questions to the media office in Washington, which did not immediately respond to a request for more information. 
 
 The sham embassy, authorities said, did not allow walk-in appointments but instead recruited customers from remote parts of West Africa and even targeted people in the neighboring countries of Ivory Coast and Togo with billboards and fliers. They would shuttle customers to Accra, rent them rooms in a nearby hotel and then shuttle them to the fake embassy, which only operated on Monday, Tuesday and Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to noon. 
 
 The Turkish citizens posing as “consulate officers,” officials said, issued U.S. work visas, counterfeit visas and false Ghanaian identification papers, such as bank and education records and birth certificates.

 The RSO investigator, with officers from the Ghana Police Force, verified the initial informant tip and then formed an international task force that included the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT and Canadian Embassy officials. 
 
 They exposed the shabby pink building as the crime ring’s central hub and discovered two other locations — a dress shop and an apartment building — that were satellite operators. 
 
 A raid at the dress shop derailed the investigation when the “corrupt Ghanaian attorney” lied to local police, officials said, telling law enforcement they could not enter the shop because it was involved in a different court case. 
 
 That court case, though, did not exist — it was a decoy meant to buy time for “corrupt officials” to find money and bail out of jail members of the crime ring, officials said. The group then moved the document-production facility — including a purported industrial sewing machine that bound the fake passports — outside Accra and exported the fraudulent documents from the dress shop to Europe and other parts of Africa. 
 
 “Several suspects” were arrested during the raids, State Department officials said, but they did not specify how many. Warrants have been issued for the suspects who escaped and Ghanaian police plan to pursue them. Officials said the investigation is ongoing. 
 
 Evidence collected during the raids included a laptop computer, smartphones, counterfeit-identity documents, 150 passports from 10 countries, and legitimate and counterfeit visas from the United States, the Schengen area of Europe, India and South Africa. 
 
 The creation of fraudulent documents has decreased by 70 percent since Operation Spartan Vanguard commenced, officials said, but called this “only the beginning.” 
 
 In Africa, many people seek visas for Western countries such as the United States, making production of fake documents at steep prices a profitable business model for crime rings, Reuters reported. 
 
 Similar operations have been busted in Accra, including one in January that had been making and selling fake documents for 13 years. In that investigation, authorities found 190 passports, three printers, one camera, 75 different rubber stamps, two lamination machines and a laptop, Modern Ghana reported. Three men were arrested.

 When you stepped inside a building in Accra, Ghana, you were greeted by an American flag and a photo of President Obama. It wasn’t the U.S. Embassy, however. 
 
 It was not operated by the United States government, but by figures from both Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian attorney practicing immigration and criminal law. The ""consular officers"" were Turkish citizens who spoke English and Dutch.

 For about a decade it operated unhindered; the criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank local documents to be doctored or counterfeited. 
 
 This past summer the assistant regional security officer investigator (ARSO-I) at the real U.S. Embassy in Accra, in cooperation with the Ghana Police Force, Ghana Detectives Bureau, and other international partners, shut down this “fake embassy.” 
 
 
 
 Exterior of the legitimate U.S. Embassy in Accra, Ghana (U.S. Department of State photo) 
 
 This investigation is a small part of the broader “Operation Spartan Vanguard"" initiative. ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" was developed by Diplomatic Security agents in the Regional Security Office (RSO) at U.S. Embassy Ghana in order to address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region. 
 
 During the course of another fraud investigation in ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" an informant tipped off the ARSO-I about the fraudulent document operation, as well as a fake Netherlands embassy operating in Accra. 
 
 After receiving the tip, the ARSO-I, who is the point person in the RSO shop for ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" investigations, verified the information with partners within the Ghanaian Police Force. The ARSO-I then created an international task force composed of the aforementioned Ghana Police Force, as well as the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT, and officials from the Canadian Embassy to investigate further. 
 
 The investigation identified the main architects of the criminal operation and several satellite locations (including a dress shop and an apartment building) used for operations. The “fake embassy” did not accept walk-in visa appointments; instead, they drove to the most remote parts of West Africa to find customers, advertising their services through flyers and billboards to cultivate customers from Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, and Togo. They would shuttle the customers to Accra, and rent them a room at a hotel nearby. The Ghanaian organized crime ring would shuttle the victims to and from the fake embassies. Locating the document vendor within the group led investigators to uncover the satellite locations and key players. 
 
 When the task force conducted raids, they arrested several suspects and collected evidence that included a laptop computer; cell smart phones; counterfeit identity documents; and 150 lost, stolen, or purchased passports from 10 countries. A small number of these passports contained expired U.S. visas. The criminals would either chemically wash and doctor expired visas or use them as a blueprint in an attempt to create counterfeit visa foils. The fraud ring sold these expired and counterfeit visas and other false identification documents (including bank records, education records, birth certificates, and others) for a cost of $6,000. 
 
 The dress shop acted as both a front for the operation—it was open to the general public for alterations and the purchase of dresses—as well as housing some of the document production. It was purported to house an industrial sewing machine they would use to re-create the binding on the fake passports. 
 
 During the raid on the dress shop the corrupt Ghanaian attorney lied to Ghanaian detectives by telling them they were not allowed to access the shop because it was involved in an additional court case. 
 
 The ""additional court case"" was determined to be fallacious, but it bought enough time for corrupt officials to arrange for bail for members of the organized crime group so that they could move the document production facility outside of Accra. Many of the documents also were exported elsewhere in Africa and to Europe through the dress shop. 
 
 Several suspects remain at large, but Ghanaian police have warrants for their arrest and plan to pursue them. The investigation and search for the Turkish organized crime group is ongoing. 
 
 After the operation was complete, both Interpol and the Bureau of Consular Affairs were sent the information collected to enter into their databases. At the request of the Ghana Police, DS Computer Forensic Lab will be assisting with forensic evaluation of the computer equipment seized in the operation. 
 
 Successful interagency operations like this are an essential part of investigating and stopping the well-connected criminal networks perpetrating passport and visa fraud. The regional security officer in Ghana reports that as a result of this and other raids in “Operation Spartan Vanguard,” the export of fraudulent documents have decreased by 70 percent in West Africa, criminal leaders no longer have the political cover they once had, and multiple other investigative avenues have opened to DS and other law enforcement partners, and this is only the beginning. 
 
","– All it takes to convince people you're a US Embassy is an American flag, a picture of President Obama, and a whole lot of visas—at least in Ghana, where a ramshackle building in Accra housed a phony embassy really run by organized crime members from Ghana and Turkey, the Guardian reports. What wasn't fake: the US visas they got their hands on and doled out for the past decade. ""The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored,"" the US State Department said in a Nov. 2 statement (per the Washington Post, the news is only being widely reported now). A visa could be had for $6,000 from ""consular officers"" who were really Turkish citizens speaking English and Dutch; customers could also get other documents, including phony birth certificates and bank statements. The ""embassy,"" only open three days a week, advertised itself on billboards and in fliers in Ghana and other West African countries. The process of obtaining a visa legally in Ghana is a ""dreadful experience,"" per the Ghana Business News, which is how these con operations flourish. This initiative was discovered after an informant tipped off an investigator involved in a larger trafficking and fraud probe in the area; the fraudulent business was shuttered over the summer.

231,"There are more American rock climbing gyms now than there’s ever been, and the popularity of indoor climbing doesn’t appear likely to slow down any time soon. That’s good news for climbing enthusiasts, and for mental health advocates who argue that bouldering — climbing without ropes or a harness — can be used as an effective treatment for depression. 
 
 In a recent study presented at the Association for Psychological Science Convention, a team of American and German psychologists argue that bouldering can be used as a psychotherapeutic intervention. While some German psychiatric hospitals already use rock climbing as therapy, this study is the evidence that it is actually a successful treatment: The team explains in BMC Psychiatry that climbing resulted in their study participants improving from being severely depressed to demonstrating “moderate to mild depression levels.” 
 
 “I hope this study and future studies are able to impact a life,” study co-author Eva-Maria Stelzer, a researcher at the University of Arizona, said in a statement. “Depression is a severe illness. Even though a variety of treatment options exist, less than one-third of people receive treatment for their symptoms.” 
 
 A total of 47 participants participated in this study and were split into two groups. One group immediately began bouldering therapy, and the other was put on a waitlist. Each study participant was either diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist, or had scored less than 13 points on the World Health Organization depression scale. Approximately half the participants were also undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment in addition to this study, and nearly 70 percent utilized anti-depressive medication. 
 
 The intervention group immediately began participating in eight weekly sessions of bouldering that were each for three hours. Every session began with a short mediation or mindfulness exercise, the pscyho-educational theme of the session would be briefly discussed (like “how to cope with anxiety”), and then a bouldering session that would precede led by mental health therapists trained in “therapeutic rock climbing.” Each session would also end with another mindfulness mediation and a discussion of that day’s experience. 
 
 After eight weeks, the groups switched out and the originally waitlisted group went through the same process. At the end of the study, the participants were asked to complete the Beck Depression Inventory survey, a symptom checklist, and questionnaire on depression and self-management skills. The researchers found that the group that immediately began the rock climbing training improved their scores on the Beck Depression Inventory by 6.27 points, while the waitlisted participants only improved by 1.4 points as they waited for their own session to begin. When this group started climbing, their scores massively improved as well, which was evidence to the researchers that bouldering therapy was an effective one. 
 
 Original Could Kratom Solve the Opioid Crisis? 
 
 The researchers believe that these results emerged because bouldering combines the benefits of group therapy, social interactions, and physical activity. While psychologists have yet to embrace physical activity as therapy, numerous studies have confirmed that it does yield beneficial, psychotherapeutic results. When people exercise “feel-good” brain chemicals like endorphins are released, immune system chemicals that worsen depression are reduced, and body temperature rises, which is believed to have a calming effect. 
 
 “In contrast to most studies in which exercise interventions consisted of running or aerobics, aimed at improving or maintaining one or more components of physical fitness, bouldering focusses in particular on mental aspects,” the researchers write. “For this reason, bouldering may be especially interesting as a therapeutic tool since many people with depression have poor physical health, low levels of fitness and physical self-worth, and less motivation for heavy physical effort.” ||||| We all experience anxiety. For example, speaking in front of a group can make us anxious, but that anxiety also motivates us to prepare and practice. Driving in heavy traffic is another common source of anxiety, but it helps keep us alert and cautious to avoid accidents. However, when feelings of intense fear and distress become overwhelming and prevent us from doing everyday activities, an anxiety disorder may be the cause. 
 
 Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health concern in the United States. An estimated 40 million adults in the U.S. (18%) have an anxiety disorder. Meanwhile, approximately 8% of children and teenagers experience an anxiety disorder. Most people develop symptoms before age 21. 
 
 Symptoms 
 
 Anxiety disorders are a group of related conditions, each having unique symptoms. However, all anxiety disorders have one thing in common: persistent, excessive fear or worry in situations that are not threatening. People typically experience one or more of the following symptoms: 
 
 Emotional symptoms: 
 
 Feelings of apprehension or dread 
 
 Feeling tense or jumpy 
 
 Restlessness or irritability 
 
 Anticipating the worst and being watchful for signs of danger 
 
 Physical symptoms: 
 
 Pounding or racing heart and shortness of breath 
 
 Sweating, tremors and twitches 
 
 Headaches, fatigue and insomnia 
 
 Upset stomach, frequent urination or diarrhea 
 
 Types of Anxiety Disorders 
 
 There are many types of anxiety disorders, each with different symptoms. The most common types of anxiety disorders include: 
 
 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 
 
 GAD produces chronic, exaggerated worrying about everyday life. This worrying can consume hours each day, making it hard to concentrate or finish daily tasks. A person with GAD may become exhausted by worry and experience headaches, tension or nausea. 
 
 Social Anxiety Disorder 
 
 More than shyness, this disorder causes intense fear about social interaction, often driven by irrational worries about humiliation (e.g. saying something stupid or not knowing what to say). Someone with social anxiety disorder may not take part in conversations, contribute to class discussions or offer their ideas, and may become isolated. Panic attacks are a common reaction to anticipated or forced social interaction. 
 
 Panic Disorder 
 
 This disorder is characterized by panic attacks and sudden feelings of terror sometimes striking repeatedly and without warning. Often mistaken for a heart attack, a panic attack causes powerful physical symptoms including chest pain, heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath and stomach upset. Many people will go to desperate measures to avoid an attack, including social isolation. 
 
 Phobias 
 
 We all tend to avoid certain things or situations that make us uncomfortable or even fearful. But for someone with a phobia, certain places, events or objects create powerful reactions of strong, irrational fear. Most people with specific phobias have several things that can trigger those reactions; to avoid panic, they will work hard to avoid their triggers. Depending on the type and number of triggers, attempts to control fear can take over a person’s life. 
 
 Other anxiety disorders include: 
 
 Agoraphobia 
 
 Selective mutism 
 
 Separation anxiety disorder 
 
 Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, involving intoxication or withdrawal or medication treatment 
 
 Causes 
 
 Scientists believe that many factors combine to cause anxiety disorders: 
 
 Genetics. Studies support the evidence that anxiety disorders “run in families,” as some families have a higher-than-average amount of anxiety disorders among relatives. 
 
 Studies support the evidence that anxiety disorders “run in families,” as some families have a higher-than-average amount of anxiety disorders among relatives. Environment. A stressful or traumatic event such as abuse, death of a loved one, violence or prolonged illness is often linked to the development of an anxiety disorder. 
 
 Diagnosis 
 
 Physical symptoms of an anxiety disorder can be easily confused with other medical conditions, like heart disease or hyperthyroidism. Therefore, a doctor will likely perform an evaluation involving a physical examination, an interview and lab tests. After ruling out an underlying physical illness, a doctor may refer a person to a mental health professional for evaluation. 
 
 Using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) a mental health professional is able to identify the specific type of anxiety disorder causing symptoms as well as any other possible disorders that may be involved. Tackling all disorders through comprehensive treatment is the best recovery strategy. 
 
 Treatment 
 
 Different anxiety disorders have their own distinct sets of symptoms. This means that each type of anxiety disorder also has its own treatment plan. But there are common types of treatment that are used. Please visit our Anxiety Treatment page for more in-depth information on the following methods: 
 
 Psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy 
 
 Medications, including antianxiety medications and antidepressants 
 
 Complementary health approaches, including stress and relaxation techniques 
 
 Related Conditions 
 
 Anxiety disorders can be seen with other mental health conditions, and they can often make related conditions worse. So, talk with a mental health care professional if you are experiencing anxiety and any of the following: 
 
 Reviewed December 2017 ||||| A growing body of research suggests that bouldering, a form of rock climbing, can help build muscle and endurance while reducing stress — and a new study co-led by a University of Arizona doctoral student of psychology suggests that the activity also may be used to effectively treat symptoms of depression. 
 
 UA researcher Eva-Maria Stelzer and Katharina Luttenberger of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg led a team that involved more than 100 individuals in a bouldering intervention in Germany, where some hospitals have begun to use climbing as a therapeutic treatment. 
 
 The participants were randomly split into two groups. One immediately began the intervention, while the other group had to wait to start bouldering, which involves climbing rocks or walls to a moderate height without ropes or a harness. Each participant bouldered for three hours a week over the course of eight weeks. 
 
 The research team measured the depression of group members at different points in the study using the Beck's Depression Inventory and the depression subscale of the Symptom Check List Revised, known as SCL-90-R. 
 
 The team's major finding was that, during the therapy, the immediate intervention group's Beck's Depression scores improved by 6.27 points, but for the same time period the group that was initially wait-listed improved by only 1.4 points. This drop in score reflects an improvement of one severity grade from moderate to mild depression levels. 
 
 ""Bouldering, in many ways, is a positive physical activity,"" said Stelzer, who began researching the benefits of bouldering while completing her master's in psychology at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and is now completing her doctorate at the UA. ""There are different routes for your physical activity level, and there's a social aspect along with the feeling of an immediate accomplishment when bouldering."" 
 
 Stelzer will present the study and findings during the 29th annual Association for Psychological Science Convention, to be held Thursday through Sunday in Boston. 
 
 In addition to Stelzer and Luttenberger, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg researchers involved were Stefan Först, Elmar Gräßel, Matthias Schopper, Johannes Kornhuber and Stephanie Book. The team has since expanded the study to compare the bouldering intervention with cognitive behavior therapy involving individuals in Erlangen, Munich and Berlin. 
 
 ""I hope this study and future studies are able to impact a life,"" Stelzer said. ""Depression is a severe illness. It is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States and worldwide. Even though a variety of treatment options exist, less than one-third of people receive treatment for their symptoms."" 
 
 The National Institute of Mental Health reports that anxiety disorders, including depression, are the most common mental illnesses in the U.S. About 18 percent of the nation's adult population, or about 40 million people, cope with anxiety disorders. 
 
 Invested in improving interventions to aid with such conditions, Stelzer, Luttenberger and Schopper, who have offered bouldering sessions for patients at a care center in Germany, drew on their own experiences as avid rock climbers and boulderers to investigate the benefits the sport could provide to those dealing with anxiety, depression, social isolation and self-esteem issues. 
 
 ""Patients enjoyed the bouldering sessions and told us that they benefited greatly,"" said Luttenberger, a psychometrics expert at the University of Erlangen, located just north of Nuremberg in Germany, about the sessions Schopper offered. ""Since rumination is one of the biggest problems for depressed individuals, we had the idea that bouldering could be a good intervention for that."" 
 
 For the study, most of the patients involved were new to bouldering. 
 
 Also during the study, both groups were taught about how to cultivate positive social interactions and about meditation and mindfulness throughout the study. All told, the study involving the intervention and follow-up lasted 24 weeks. 
 
 Stelzer explained that bouldering has a number of other important characteristics that make it especially beneficial for the treatment of depression, namely that it helps boost self-efficacy and social interactions — both of which hold innate benefits for dealing with depression. 
 
 ""You have to be mindful and focused on the moment. It does not leave much room to let your mind wonder on things that may be going on in your life — you have to focus on not falling,"" Stelzer said. 
 
 ""Bouldering not only has strong mental components, but it is accessible at different levels so that people of all levels of physical health are able to participate,"" she said, adding that because many people who are depressed deal with isolation, bouldering as a treatment could bolster physical activity and be used as a social tool allowing people to interact with one another. 
 
 Given the positive results, the team believes that bouldering may be used to complement traditional care for clinical depression. Team members are now working to develop a manual that could be adopted for an eight-week program integrating bouldering and psychotherapeutic interventions for groups. 
 
 Said Luttenberger: ""I'd always encourage patients to do the sport they like — may it be climbing or something else — as sport is a wonderful possibility to prevent all possible sorts of illnesses, mental and physical.""","– Heading out for a weekend climb or scaling the rock wall at the gym may be good therapy for treating depression, new research shows. A University of Arizona study found that a form of rock climbing eased depression symptoms in participants from moderate to mild levels after eight weeks, Inverse reports. The sport, also known as bouldering, which doesn't use ropes or harnesses, combines physicality and self-sufficiency, both of which have been shown to be beneficial in combatting depression, researchers say. ""You have to be mindful and focused on the moment,"" lead author Eva-Maria Stelzer says. The sport ""does not leave much room to let your mind wonder on things that may be going on in your life—you have to focus on not falling."" Researchers divided more than 100 people in Germany diagnosed with depression, or who received low scores on a depression on a WHO depression scale, into two groups, the first of which immediately began climbing rocks or walls at a moderate height for three hours a week. Most were new to the sport. Over eight weeks, early participants showed a 6.27-point improvement in their score, while those in the second group who didn't climb saw a boost of just 1.4 points. When the sedentary group got the green light to climb in a second trial, their scores increased as well. Some German hospitals are using bouldering to treat depression, Inverse notes. Stelzer says bouldering could be a useful treatment in the US, where some 40 million American adults suffer from anxiety disorders.

 WASHINGTON The U.S. Postal Service's losses shot up to $3.3 billion in the last three months of 2011, a tenfold jump from the same period a year before, as its customer base eroded with the growth of email and online billing. 
 
 The cash-strapped agency recorded the loss during its traditionally strongest period, the year-end holiday shipping season, as declines in mail volumes outweighed growth in shipping. 
 
 ""Technology continues to have a major impact on how our customers use the mail,"" Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said in a statement on Thursday. 
 
 ""While it has helped us grow our Shipping Services businesses, it has had a significant negative impact on some of our much larger sources of revenue."" 
 
 The agency reiterated its call for Congress to pass legislation giving the Postal Service flexibility to remake its crumbling business. 
 
 Postal officials want lawmakers to allow the agency to tap into a retirement-fund surplus and permit it to offer new services. It also wants to end Saturday delivery and eliminate a large annual payment to prefund retiree health benefits. 
 
 ""The longer the Postal Service remains in a weak position, the more damage can be done to our business,"" Chief Financial Officer Joe Corbett said during a conference call with reporters. 
 
 ""We need to change and get back to a point where we're financially stable so that our customers and our suppliers have faith in us."" 
 
 The Postal Service lost $5.1 billion the last fiscal year, which ended on September 30. Corbett warned the agency could hit its legally mandated borrowing limit this fall. A downturn in the economy or other unforeseen circumstances could cause a cash crunch that would force the agency to miss some payments in order to keep paying employees and suppliers, he said. 
 
 Total mail volume dropped 6 percent in the first fiscal quarter which ended on December 31, the Postal Service said. 
 
 Declines in first-class and standard mail revenue outweighed a boost to the package business from increased online shopping during the holidays. 
 
 Total revenue fell 1.1 percent to $17.7 billion, the Postal Service said. 
 
 The Postal Service said it needs to reduce operating costs by $20 billion by 2015, and that it expects large losses to continue unless it sees results from a plan to close thousands of facilities, eliminate jobs and restructure its healthcare program, as well as action from Congress. 
 
 Lawmakers remain deeply divided on closing post offices, ending Saturday mail and eliminating the retiree health benefit payment. But the losses could pressure Congress to act. 
 
 ""USPS has reached a new, deeper level of crisis,"" said Republican Representative Darrell Issa, author of postal legislation in the House of Representatives. ""Congress must pass legislation that allows USPS to reduce its operating costs and realign its network in line with America's declining demand for paper mail."" 
 
 The Postal Service, which relies on sales of stamps and other products rather than taxpayer dollars, said it expects to default on this year's retiree health prefunding payment. 
 
 (Editing by Vicki Allen and Mohammad Zargham) ||||| The U.S. Postal Service said Thursday that its quarterly loss widened to $3.3 billion amid declining mail volume and mounting costs for future retiree health benefits as it struggles to stave off bankruptcy. 
 
 From October through December 2011, losses were $3 billion more than the same period a year ago, even though that quarter is typically the strongest due to increased holiday shipping. The mail agency said that at this rate, it will run out of money by October. 
 
 The Postal Service is seeking new leeway from Congress to eliminate Saturday mail delivery, raise stamp prices and reduce health and other labor costs. 
 
 Also at stake are roughly 100,000 jobs, part of a postal cost-cutting plan to save up to $6.5 billion a year by closing 252 mail processing centers and up to 3,700 post offices. At the request of Congress, the cash-strapped agency agreed to wait until mid-May to begin closures so lawmakers would have time to stabilize its finances first. 
 
 Prospects for immediate congressional action remain uncertain. 
 
 ""Passage of legislation is urgently needed that provides the Postal Service with the speed and flexibility needed to cut costs that are not under our control, including employee health costs,"" said Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe. 
 
 He said the post office must cut $20 billion in annual costs by 2015 so it can reach profitability, rather than becoming a ""long-term burden to taxpayers."" 
 
 Overall, the post office had income of $17.7 billion from October through December, the first quarter of its 2012 fiscal year. That was down $200 million from the same period last year. Expenses were $17.5 billion. 
 
 In addition, the Postal Service had costs stemming from yearly advance payments of roughly $5.5 billion to a future retiree health-benefit fund. Because the agency is low on cash, Congress agreed to extend the legal deadline for last year's payment until this fall, when this year's payment will also be due. 
 
 In its financial statement, the post office spread the total $11.1 billion in costs over 12 months, creating additional quarterly debt of more than $3 billion. Without those annual payments _ not required of other government agencies _ the post office would have posted a profit in most recent years and had a loss of roughly $200 million in the last quarter. 
 
 The Postal Service also has been rocked by declining mail volume as people and businesses continue switching to the Internet in place of letters and paper bills. The number of items mailed during the last quarter was 43.7 billion pieces, a 6 percent decrease, much of it in first-class mail. 
 
 On the positive side, postal shipping services such as express and priority mail had an 8 percent increase in income to $3.2 billion, with package volume in the holiday period nearly double that of FedEx and UPS, according to postal officials. 
 
 Separate proposals passed last year by House and Senate committees would scrap or reduce the annual health prepayment requirement, but they differ widely on financial oversight and a reduction to five-day-a-week delivery. The Senate initially planned to take action earlier this month but stalled as some lawmakers pushed for changes that would delay decisions on closings and delivery cuts for two more years. 
 
 On Thursday, Donahoe said reducing the size of its postal network was critical to its efforts to reduce costs. Closure of mail-processing centers were still planned to begin after mid-May. He said the mail agency was revising some of its proposals to accommodate the needs of rural communities, which rely more heavily on postal service for the delivery of newspapers, prescription drugs and other services. 
 
 As part of the changes, the mail agency plans cuts to first-class mail that would slow delivery and, for the first time, virtually eliminate the chance for stamped letters to arrive the next day. 
 
 ""We have to make sure we are taking actions that are swift to maintain our liquidity and pay our bills,"" said chief financial officer Joe Corbett, warning that large losses will continue without changes. 
 
 Last year, postal losses totaled $5.1 billion. 
 
 In the event of a postal shutdown, private companies such as FedEx and UPS could handle a small portion of the material the post office moves, but they do not go everywhere. No business has shown interest in delivering letters everywhere in the country for a set rate of 45 cents for a first-class letter. 
 
 ""We have a Postal Service that essentially is living from paycheck to paycheck, which is a very risky proposition for the American economy and the 8 million private sector workers whose jobs rely on the mail,"" said Art Sackler, coordinator of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, a group representing the private sector mailing industry. ""Each day Congress fails to enact postal reform, this problem grows more difficult and perhaps more expensive to resolve.""

 According to The Eagle in College Station, a shooting that left a 19-year-old college student dead started with an argument over the rules of beer pong. But her death appears random. 
 
 Early on the morning of Sunday, May 3, Lacie LaRose was shot in the neck at a house party in College Station, where people had gathered to watch Floyd Mayweather fight Manny Pacquiao on TV, reported KXTX news in May. 
 
 A report from the College Station Police Department said 39-year-old Ronald McNeil, a neighbor of the party host, fired the shot that killed LaRose. 
 
 Early accounts said there'd been a scuffle, but details lacked. Now new witness testimony, reported by The Eagle, indicates that an argument erupted between McNeil and other partygoers regarding the rules of a beer pong game underway. It eventually led to a brief exchange of blows. The witness told The Eagle that McNeil and a group of his friends had been evicted from the party, but pledged to return armed. 
 
 And allegedly he did. According to accounts, McNeil entered the house's backyard and fired fourteen shots from a handgun, which he told police he'd intended to scare the party guests with whom he'd argued. One man was hit in the leg, and one took shrapnel, but LaRose, a bystander, received a fatal bullet. 
 
 She died early Sunday morning in the College Station Medical Center, The Eagle Reports.

234,"After months of rumour and speculation as to what might have come of her, China’s highest-paid actress Fan Bingbing was back centre stage on Wednesday with a grovelling apology to her fans and the Communist Party, and a colossal bill for overdue taxes and fines. 
 
 “Recently, I have experienced unprecedented pain and agony,” she wrote on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, where she has more than 62 million followers. 
 
 “I have undergone profound thought and reflection. I feel ashamed and guilty about what I have done, and I sincerely apologise to you all!” 
 
 Fan’s letter – her first public statement since June – came after China’s tax authorities ordered her to pay nearly 884 million yuan (US$129 million) in overdue taxes and fines, Xinhua reported on Wednesday. 
 
 The star was released from “residential surveillance at a designated location” – a form of secret detention – about two weeks ago and returned to Beijing as the tax authorities completed their investigation, sources with knowledge of the case told the South China Morning Post. 
 
 One said Fan had been kept in a “holiday resort” used to investigate officials, in a suburb of Wuxi in coastal Jiangsu province. 
 
 The sources disagreed, however, on what might happen next, with one saying the star would now face further questioning on related investigations, and the other saying her ordeal was over. 
 
 Fan, 37, who gained international fame after appearing in the X-Men and Iron Man film franchises, is the most famous and bankable star to be incriminated under a government crackdown launched in the summer on tax evasion among high-earning celebrities. 
 
 Her case is expected to serve as a clear warning to others in the entertainment industry about the consequences for those who fail to pay their tax bills, Xinhua said in a separate article. 
 
 In their investigation, the tax authorities found that Fan owed more than 255 million yuan in unpaid taxes, of which 200 million yuan was regarded as tax evasion, the first report said. 
 
 She and her companies were ordered to pay the unpaid taxes, and fined about 600 million yuan. 
 
 In a breakdown of the tax bill and fines, Xinhua said that Fan would have to pay 33 million yuan as a surcharge to her overdue taxes of 255 million yuan. 
 
 She was also fined 240 million yuan for using spurious contracts to conceal her true income and 239 million yuan for using the accounts of her studio to hide her personal income. Her companies, meanwhile, were fined a combined 117 million yuan for offences ranging from omitting income from their books – so as not to pay tax on it – to providing illicit assistance in the act of tax evasion. 
 
 Despite the hefty penalties, Fan will not face criminal charges if she pays all the money by an undisclosed deadline as requested by the tax authorities, Xinhua said, citing a 2009 amendment to China’s criminal law. 
 
 The State Administration of Taxation, meanwhile, said that companies and individuals in the entertainment industry that voluntarily “rectify their behaviour” and pay previously evaded taxes before December 31 will be exempt from administrative punishment and fines. 
 
 In her apology, Fan said she fully accepted the punishment by the authorities and would “overcome all difficulties” to pay what she owed. 
 
 “One could say that every bit of the achievement I have made cannot be separated from the support of the state and the people. Without the good policies of the Communist Party and the state, without the people’s love and care, there would be no Fan Bingbing,” she wrote. 
 
 A familiar face on film and television, as well as serving as ambassador for several luxury brands, Fan earned 300 million yuan (US$43.5 million) last year, according to the 2017 Forbes China Celebrity List. The only Chinese celebrity who earned more than her was Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan, with an estimated 330 million yuan. 
 
 According to Forbes, Fan earned 1.4 billion yuan between 2003 and 2016. 
 
 In 2015, she was quoted as saying: “I don’t want to marry someone who’s rich. I am someone who’s rich.” 
 
 Her troubles began in May, when an outspoken presenter on state television, Cui Yongyuan, posted snapshots on Weibo of two contracts that appeared to be for a coming film of Fan’s. One showed a salary of US$1.6 million to be reported to the tax authorities, while the second appeared to show an actual payment of US$7.8 million – a prevalent tax-dodging practice known as yin-yang contracts. 
 
 Amid a public outcry ignited by his whistle-blowing, Cui later apologised to Fan and in June withdrew his claims altogether. That, however, did not stop the State Administration of Taxation from launching an investigation, which led to her disappearance. 
 
 Her abrupt silence sparked a cascade of rumours and concerns, with many people questioning why an investigation into tax evasion was being handled in such a secretive manner. 
 
 Fan was held under “residential surveillance at a designated location”, a form of detention introduced into criminal law in 2012 that lets police detain anyone suspected of endangering state security, terrorism or significant corruption at an undisclosed location for up to six months. 
 
 Since its introduction, the detention has been regularly used to intern rights lawyers and activists and block their access to family members and legal counsel. The practice has been widely condemned by rights groups. 
 
 Fan’s detention was followed by a wide-reaching crackdown on tax evasion and offshore currency transfers among high-profile celebrities in the fields of entertainment and sports. 
 
 The investigations involved tax officials, the foreign exchange watchdog, financial crime investigators and regulators from the publishing, broadcasting and sports bureaus, sources told the Post earlier. 
 
 The investigation found that Fan used yin-yang contracts when working on Unbreakable Spirit, the war film known outside China as Air Strike and also starring Bruce Willis. Of her actual payment of 30 million yuan, only a third was included in the contract that she presented to the tax bureau – enabling her to evade at least 6 million yuan of personal income tax, according to Xinhua. 
 
 Meanwhile, Fan’s agent has been detained by police for further investigation for allegedly hiding and destroying accounting records during an initial investigation in June, the report said. 
 
 Tax officials in Wuxi, a base for the country’s film and television industry near Shanghai where Fan has three movie studios, have also been implicated in the case, it said.

 Letter of Apology 
 
 Recently, I have experienced unprecedented pain and agony, and I have undergone profound thought and reflection. I feel ashamed and guilty about what I have done, and I sincerely apologise to you all! 
 
 For a long time, I did not respect the relationship between the interests of the state, society, and myself, and used “split contracts” and other tax evasion methods in relation to the film Air Strike and others. I am deeply ashamed of this. 
 
 These days, through my cooperation with the tax authorities’ tax inspections of me and my company, I have been reflecting deeply: as a public figure, I should abide by the law and be a role model for society and the industry. 
 
 We should not lose self-discipline and succumb to lax management for economic interests and break the law. Here, I sincerely apologise to society, to the friends who care about me, to the public and to the national tax authorities. 
 
 I completely accept the series of decisions on penalties made in accordance with the law by the tax authorities in their investigation. I will try my best to overcome all difficulties, raise funds, pay taxes, and pay fines according to the final decision of the tax authorities. 
 
 I have liked the arts from an early age, and I had the great opportunity to rise with a booming film industry. With the guidance of many of my seniors, and the love of my audience, I have made my own persistent effort, and with all these things I have made some small achievement in the performing arts. 
 
 As an actor, I am always proud of being able to showcase my country’s culture on the world stage, and I have spared no efforts to promote this. One could say that every bit of the achievement I have made cannot be separated from the support of the state and the people. Without the good policies of the Communist Party and the state, without the people’s love and care, there would be no Fan Bingbing. 
 
 Today, I am deeply disturbed by the mistakes I have made! I have failed the state’s cultivation of me, failed the trust society had in me, and failed the love of my fans! Here, I sincerely apologise once again to everyone! Please forgive me! 
 
 I believe, after going through this rectification, I will follow the rules, be orderly and responsible. While presenting good works to you all, I will also supervise the management of [my] companies, abide the law in company operations, be honest and trustworthy, and strive to be a cultured and good company that spreads positive energy to society! 
 
 Once again, I would like to sincerely say to society, to the fans who have always supported me, and to the friends and family who care for me: sorry! 
 
 Fan Bingbing 
 
 October 3, 2018 ||||| The star reportedly was held for weeks in a remote ""holiday resort"" used to investigate Chinese officials suspected of corruption. 
 
 Fan Bingbing, China's most famous — and recently ""disappeared"" — actress, is back in Beijing and at her liberty, according to local sources. 
 
 The star was released from secret detention and returned to the Chinese capital about two weeks ago, as Beijing regulators concluded their investigation into her tax evasion case, according to a report Thursday in the South China Morning Post, which cited sources ""with knowledge of the case."" 
 
 On Wednesday, China's tax authorities slapped Fan with a fine equivalent to about $130 million (nearly 892 million yuan) for tax evasion and other offenses. She then issued her first public statement in months — a groveling apology to the Communist Party of China and the public at large, admitting to all wrongdoing and begging for forgiveness. 
 
 A central issue that remained unclear, however, was where Fan had been during the intervening months, and whether she had regained her freedom. The star, usually a ubiquitous presence at glamorous events of East and West, still hasn't been seen in public since July 1. 
 
 A senior film executive in Beijing told THR on Thursday that they had been in contact with Fan since her statement. ""She has regained her liberty and is in relatively good spirits,"" the exec said, asking not to be named because of the case's ongoing sensitivity in China. 
 
 According to the SCMP, the star was held under ""residential surveillance at a designated location,"" an official Chinese form of secret detention. She was reportedly kept in a ""holiday resort"" used to investigate Chinese officials suspected of corruption, in a suburb of Wuxi in coastal Jiangsu province, where her embattled company is based. 
 
 The practice of ""residential surveillance at a designated location” was introduced into Chinese criminal law in 2012. The system allows the Chinese police to detain anyone suspected of endangering state security, plotting terrorism or significant corruption at an undisclosed location for up to six months without access to legal counsel or family contact. The practice has been regularly condemned by international rights groups since its introduction. 
 
 Fan's return to the public sphere followed a script many in the Chinese film industry had privately anticipated: an enormous, signal-sending fine, followed by a carefully orchestrated apology — but none of the bad optics of China's most glamorous movie star being hauled off to jail, which may have appeared too draconian even for the People's Republic of China. 
 
 The timing was also notable, if predictable, to many insiders. The authorities chose the middle of China's weeklong patriotic National Day holiday to unfurl their globally news-making handling of Fan — a time when China's stock exchanges are closed, avoiding the potential for market turmoil caused by a potential crash in entertainment stocks (all eyes are now on Monday when trading resumes). 
 
 As the staggering size of Fan's penalties were unveiled — around $130 million in total — the natural question was whether she could possibly afford it, and just how wealthy ""China's highest paid actress actually is."" The State Administration of Taxation said Fan will only escape criminal charges if she pays all the money by an undisclosed deadline, according to state news outlet Xinhua. 
 
 One of the very most famous faces from film and television during China's unprecedented box-office boom era — when salaries for top stars exploded — Fan is undoubtedly rich, fantastically so. In addition to prominent roles in films like Feng Xiaogang's Cell Phone and Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past, she has also been known as a fashion icon, serving as the public face in China for brands as various as Montblanc, Louis Vuitton, Adidas, De Beers and fashion house Guerlain. 
 
 According to the SCMP's estimates, Fan earned about $208 million (1.4 billion yuan) between 2003 and 2016; and Forbes pegs her 2017 earnings at a whopping $43.5 million (300 million yuan). Just prior to Fan's tax evasion scandal exploding into public view in June, Chinese social media was awash with rumors that she had bought a luxury condo in Shanghai for nearly $40 million (270 million yuan). 
 
 Still, such estimates undoubtedly involve a fair degree of speculation and hazy guesswork. (Consider, after all, that Fan's whole ongoing legal debacle stems from her various machinations over the years to obscure her true income, and that even the Chinese government apparently didn't have anything like a full account of her wealth until its recent investigations). 
 
 But the common thinking in Beijing industry circles has it that the authorities — which have been peering into her accounts for months — wouldn't bother to levy a fine that they had no hope of recouping. And given that she'll most likely be headed to a Chinese prison if she fails to pay in full, most are betting that Fan will find a way to assemble the $130 million. 
 
 As she put it in her apology letter on Wednesday: ""I will try my best to overcome all difficulties, raise funds, pay taxes, and pay fines according to the final decision of the tax authorities.""","– More than three months after she disappeared from public view, Chinese actress Fan Bingbing has resurfaced.

235,"WASHINGTON, DC — As part of his commitment to make 2014 a year of action using his pen and phone, President Obama will sign a proclamation today to establish the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in south-central New Mexico, an action that, according to independent analysis, could generate $7.4 million in new economic activity each year. Using his authorities under the Antiquities Act, the President’s action will permanently preserve approximately 496,000 acres to ensure that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans while preserving access for sportsmen, ranchers, and recreational users. The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument joins the ten other national monuments President Obama has designated across the country to permanently protect sites that are significant to our nation’s rich history and natural heritage. 
 
 “Whether they’re hiking or camping or fishing, visitors to our parks and public lands are not only enjoying the bounty of our natural resources, but also promoting jobs and growth. And continuing to set aside federal land for outdoor recreation will drive critical revenue for those local communities, and preserve our pristine land for generations to come,” said President Obama. 
 
 “Today is the culmination of a community-led effort to preserve, protect and promote these public lands, but it’s the beginning of a new chapter for the businesses that will benefit from the tourism and recreation, and the wildlife that rely on this unique habitat,” said Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. “The Organ Mountains and surrounding Desert Peaks are steeped in culture, history, wildlife and opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors – from hunting to hiking to gazing at ancient petroglyphs and fossils – and the President’s action ensures that these cherished landscapes are celebrated and passed on to the generations of New Mexicans and Americans to come.” 
 
 The President’s proclamation honors years of work by the local community and businesses seeking increased protection and recognition for the area. Senators Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall have championed legislation to protect and preserve the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks region. Conservation groups and sportsmen’s organizations, local tribal governments, veterans and ranchers, faith leaders and Latino leaders, historic preservationists, the nearby cities of Las Cruces and El Paso, and over two hundred local businesses have also expressed support for permanent protection. 
 
 The area is home to a high diversity of animal life, including deer, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, peregrine falcons and other raptors as well as rare plants, some found nowhere else in the world, such as the Organ Mountains pincushion cactus. Hundreds of archeologically and culturally significant sites are found within the new monument, including some limited Paleo-Indian artifacts, extensive rock art sites and the ruins of a ten room pueblo, among other ancient dwellings. More recent history is memorialized with Geronimo’s Cave, Billy the Kid's Outlaw Rock, and sites related to early Spanish explorers. The Organ and Doña Ana Mountains are popular recreation areas, with multiple hiking trails, a popular campground, and opportunities for hunting, mountain biking, rock climbing, and other recreation. 
 
 Today’s action builds on steps the Administration has taken over the past five years as part of the America's Great Outdoors initiative, which fosters a 21st century approach to conservation that responds to the priorities of the American people. When he signed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, President Obama marked the most extensive expansion of land and water conservation in more than a generation, designating more than 2 million acres of federal wilderness, thousands of miles of trails, and protecting more than 1,000 miles of rivers. 
 
 Wilderness, parks, forests, monuments, and other public lands help support local economies through tourism. Recent estimates also show that over $50 billion were added to the economy from visits to public lands in 2012 alone. In fact, a recent study says that this national monument could double the number of visitors to the region and help grow the local economy by more than 70%. Protected public lands also attract businesses interested in relocating to areas with beautiful scenery, outdoor opportunities, and a high quality of life. These businesses can bring high paying jobs, which helps explain why, on average, western non-metro counties’ per capita income increases when there is more protected public land in the area. The outdoor recreation industry supports 6.1 million jobs nationwide. 
 
 First exercised by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 to designate Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming, the authority of the Antiquities Act has been used by 16 presidents since 1906 to protect unique natural and historic features in America, such as the Grand Canyon, the Statue of Liberty, and Colorado's Canyons of the Ancients. 
 
 The monument will continue to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the system of National Conservation Lands. The Bureau of Land Management currently manages the federal land within the national monument for multiple uses, including conservation of natural and archeological resources and outdoor recreation, such as hiking, biking, camping and hunting. Recreation on BLM-managed lands and waters in New Mexico supported more than 1,900 jobs and contributed more than $170 million to the state’s economy in fiscal year 2012. ||||| The immigration battle is seeping into unlikely territory: A new national monument in New Mexico. 
 
 Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that President Barack Obama’s move to designate nearly 500,000 acres of land in New Mexico as a national monument could undermine security along the southern border — an argument disputed by the agency that oversees border security.

 “For many months, I have warned that the president’s fondness for unilateral action has created widespread doubt among the American people that he and his administration can be counted on to enforce any law he signs, particularly when it comes to securing our nation’s borders and reforming our immigration system,” Boehner said. 
 
 “The president’s announcement today intensifies those concerns, demonstrating a level of audacity that is remarkable even for this administration,” the Ohio Republican added. 
 
 At issue is the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument, located in south central New Mexico. Preserving the 496,000 acres as a monument could generate $7.4 million in economic activity through tourism and other revenue, according to the White House. 
 
 But the problem for Boehner and other House Republicans is that the White House went around Congress to designate the area as a national monument through executive order. And Boehner’s office said legislation in both chambers of Congress that would have accomplished the goal of Obama’s proclamation included border security protections that were not included with the White House action. 
 
 “This designation will in no way limit our ability to perform our important border security mission, and in fact provides important flexibility as we work to meet this ongoing priority,” Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. “CBP is committed to continuing to work closely with the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service to maintain border security while ensuring the protection of the environment along the border.” 
 
 House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), whose panel handles immigration policy, raised similar concerns earlier this week. Republicans say because of the way the declaration is written, it prevents Border Patrol from accessing key areas along the southwestern boundary. 
 
 “Once again, the president has chosen to bypass the legislative branch — and, in this case, do so in a manner that adds yet another challenge in our ongoing efforts to secure our Southern border,” Boehner said. “At a time of continued cartel violence in Mexico, we should not be putting any additional restraints on efforts to protect our borders.” 
 
 Though the monument itself is a relatively obscure issue, it plays into a broader narrative from House Republicans that has become the chief problem voiced by the conference: They simply don’t trust Obama to implement any immigration laws Congress may pass. Democrats and immigration advocates dismiss that reason as an excuse. 
 
 Meanwhile, House Republican leaders have yet to move any immigration reform bills, nearly a year after the Democratic-led Senate passed a comprehensive measure. Earlier Wednesday, leaders blocked a measure that would have legalized young undocumented immigrants who serve in the military from getting a vote during the National Defense Authorization Act debate.","– President Obama yesterday used his executive power to designate 500,000 acres of desert along New Mexico's southern border a national monument. It's a move being praised by environmentalists and ... slammed by John Boehner, who called it ""a level of audacity that is remarkable even for this administration."" What's the big deal? Well, Boehner and others argue the move could undermine security along the US-Mexico border, Politico reports. ""Once again, the president has chosen to bypass the legislative branch—and, in this case, do so in a manner that adds yet another challenge in our ongoing efforts to secure our southern border,"" Boehner said. ""At a time of continued cartel violence in Mexico, we should not be putting any additional restraints on efforts to protect our borders."" Customs and Border Protection say the move ""will in no way limit our ability to perform our important border security mission, and in fact provides important flexibility as we work to meet this ongoing priority."" But critics point out there are no terms to allow local police to patrol the area—which includes ancient lava flows, rock outcroppings, hunting areas, and Billy the Kid's Outlaw Rock, the AP reports—which is something that could have been addressed if the motion had passed through Congress. The White House has countered, noting the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument could generate $7.4 million in economic activity through tourism and other revenue.",<pad> President Obama signed a proclamation today to establish the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument.</s>,0.10471204034977112,0.04838709563768213,0.10471204034977112
236,"MATT LAUER, co-host: Let us begin, though, this half-hour with that incredibly disturbing story out of Texas , video of a father repeatedly hitting his daughter with a belt. He is a judge. And a warning, this is very difficult to watch. We'll talk to the judge's daughter exclusively in a moment. But first, NBC 's Janet Shamlian is live in Rockport , Texas , with the story. Janet , good morning to you. 
 
 JANET SHAMLIAN reporting: Matt , good morning. Yeah, it bears repeating: This video is graphic, it is disturbing, it's difficult to watch, and it has taken the Internet by storm. More than 1.6 million views on YouTube , most of those within the last 24 hours. A Texas judge here in Rockport , Aransas County , repeatedly whipping his teenage daughter with a leather strap even as she was crying and pleading with him to stop. 
 
 Judge WILLIAM ADAMS: Get over here. 
 
 SHAMLIAN: The man in this video is Texas Judge William Adams and the girl is his then 16-year-old daughter , who has cerebral palsy. 
 
 Judge ADAMS: Bend over that bed. Bend over the bed. Bend over the bed! 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS (Released Videotape of Beating From Her Father): Stop! 
 
 SHAMLIAN: The beating continues unabated for most of the seven-minute video that has swept the Internet and provoked an online outcry. Again and again , Hillary Adams cries out after being lashed by her father's belt on her legs, her arms and her buttocks, once at the hand of her mother. 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS (Mother of Hillary Adams): You turn over . I'm going to spank on your butt. You turn over like a 16-year-old and take it! Like a grown woman! Turn over ! 
 
 SHAMLIAN: The disturbing scene was captured seven years ago in her bedroom, Hillary says, after her dad found out she had downloaded music from an illegal website. 
 
 Judge ADAMS: Are you happy? Huh? Disobeying your parents? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Stop! 
 
 SHAMLIAN: After holding onto the video since 2004 , Hillary , now 23 and living on her own, uploaded it to YouTube after she says her father continued to harass her and she finally had enough. 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: The disputes and the harassment were escalating and finally it just was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back, and I told him I had the video and he brushed it off. 
 
 SHAMLIAN: William Adams isn't just Hillary 's father. He's a judge in south Texas , where he routinely rules on cases involving children. He also sits on a county board overseeing the juvenile system. He admits that's him in the video . 
 
 Judge ADAMS: No, I -- in my mind I haven't done anything wrong other than discipline my child after she was caught stealing . And I did lose my temper but I've since apologized. It looks worse than it is. There is a story. It'll come out in due time , OK? 
 
 Offscreen Voice: And it's because she downloaded a game onto your computer or something? 
 
 Judge ADAMS: No, she was stealing -- I don't want to get into it, OK? 
 
 Voice: OK. 
 
 Judge ADAMS: But there was a reason she was being disciplined. 
 
 SHAMLIAN: But as a family's private feud went public and viral, outrage has boiled over. Facebook pages have sprung up decrying Judge Adams . The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct has been flooded with demands he be removed from the bench, and in tiny Rockport , police have been swamped by calls from all over the world . Chief Tim Jayroe has opened an investigation at the district attorney's request to determine whether the beating was criminal. When does it cross the line? When does discipline within a family become assault? 
 
 Mr. TIM JAYROE (Rockport Police Chief): Yeah, frequently that's a difficult thing to determine because by state law a person has a right to discipline their children to a point, but not to the point that you cause serious bodily injury to a child. 
 
 SHAMLIAN: Hillary 's mother has since divorced Adams and apologized for her role in the beating. For his part, Judge Adams insists his daughter wasn't hurt. 
 
 Judge ADAMS: I lost my temper. I spanked her. Her mother was there. She wasn't hurt. It was a long time ago. 
 
 Voice: Do you acknowledge that it's -- the beating was excessive, the spanking, the discipline? 
 
 Judge ADAMS: No, I'm not going to get into any of that, OK? 
 
 SHAMLIAN: Police say Judge Adams has left Rockport , and a note outside the courthouse informs his hearings have been canceled. 
 
 Judge ADAMS: Well, then I ought to just keep beating you... 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Stop! 
 
 Judge ADAMS: ...and beating you! 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Stop! 
 
 SHAMLIAN: A daughter 's disclosure as a family's private troubles go public. Authorities tell NBC News that for a charge such as bodily injury to a child the statute of limitations is five years. This video is seven years old, so it's likely no charges will be filed. As for Judge Adams ' seat here on the bench, county officials tell me that when the judge does return, for any cases involving children, a visiting judge is going to handle those at least for now. Matt : 
 
 LAUER: Janet Shamlian . Thank you very much . Hillary and Hallie Adams are here with us for an exclusive interview. Ladies, good morning to both of you. 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Good morning, Matt. 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: Good morning. 
 
 LAUER: We only showed a little portion of that tape. It goes on for seven very long minutes. We showed it in our newsroom yesterday to people who have seen an awful lot of tough things. They were universally upset by this. As you watch it seven years later, Hillary , what goes through your mind? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: It -- well, I've experienced everything from crying about it to almost just laughing. I've just experienced so many emotions, and sometimes it's like reliving it and sometimes it's like watching it from a completely third-person point of view. It's just -- it's really impossible to put all that into words. 
 
 LAUER: Families in this country struggle with the dilemma of punishing and discipline all the time, to spank or not spank. I think the belt thing seems to cross a line. But was this something that happened regularly in your house? Is that why you set that camera up in the room that night? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: It did happen regularly for a period of time, and I could tell because of the pattern that things were escalating again, so I set up my video camera on my dresser and covered the little red light with a scarf. And about half an hour after I set the camera up, this happened, and it was amazing that I was able to capture such a thing. 
 
 LAUER: Why did you wait seven years? You've had this video ; you clearly are as upset about it today as you were back then. Why did you wait seven years, and why release it on the Internet as opposed to going to authorities with it? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Well, I waited seven years because back then I was still a minor and living under his roof, and releasing it then would have -- I don't know would have happened to me or my mother or my little sister . So waiting till today, seven years later just about, it has enabled me to pull away and be able to distance myself from the consequences. 
 
 LAUER: You released a note accompanying the video , quote, ""Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again."" Now, he's not up for re-election right now. I don't think that comes for three years. So again, the timing of this is in question. Why? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: It just -- it was like I said in that previous video . It was the straw that broke the camel's back. It wasn't any, you know, huge happening or anything. I just -- I told him I had the video and he didn't seem to think anything of it and basically dared me to post it. 
 
 LAUER: Do you want him to lose his job? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: I think wishing anybody to lose their job is not a really good thing to do, but... 
 
 LAUER: But he -- because of a public outcry , there's a chance... 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Yeah. 
 
 LAUER: ...he may be forced to step down... 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: I know. 
 
 LAUER: ...even if no criminal charges are filed against him. 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: But his being fit for the job, that's something I really can't say that he is. 
 
 LAUER: Hallie , let me turn to you because you're in this tape. 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: Yes. 
 
 LAUER: And we heard you in there... 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: Yes. 
 
 LAUER: ...saying, ' Turn over . Take it like a 16-year-old girl.' I mean... 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: It's chilling. 
 
 LAUER: ...how does a mother -- how does a mother not only stand by and watch her husband do that to her daughter , but take part in it? 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: That's a good question and that's what I had to ask myself. I didn't know about the video until this -- well, until this past April, and this past weekend was the first time I saw it. And my answer to you and to the world is something that I've been hiding for a very long time as a family secret , and that's addiction. And my husband... 
 
 LAUER: Addiction on your part or on... 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: No, sir. 
 
 LAUER: On his part. 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: Yes, sir. 
 
 LAUER: But still that doesn't tell me why you participated in it and watched it. 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: Because I lived in an environment of dysfunction and it steadily got worse. I tried to -- I did leave him when she was six months old, and he shamed me into going back and I did my best to make the marriage work. 
 
 LAUER: So were you afraid for your own safety if you had stood up to this man, that you would... 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: I was completely brainwashed and controlled. I did every single thing that he did. When I leave the room, he's telling me what to say, what to do. 
 
 LAUER: Are you angry at your mom? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: No. No, we're very close now. It -- she -- when I showed her the video , she started crying, hasn't stopped apologizing, and I forgive her because she knows everything that happened. 
 
 LAUER: Judge Adams said on Wednesday, quote, ""I haven't done anything wrong other than discipline my child after she was caught stealing . I did lose my temper but I've since apologized. It looks worse than it is. There is a story. It will come out in due time ."" What is the story that you think he is referring to. 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: He -- well, I think he feared and didn't understand the Internet because the media that I wanted to obtain was overseas and at that time I couldn't have purchased it if I'd wanted to. So I think there's some controversy there. 
 
 LAUER: But is there more that's going on in this family that I don't about. 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Well... 
 
 LAUER: You're saying yes. 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: Mm-hmm. 
 
 LAUER: What else is there ? 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: I think that the story that's going to come out in undue time in his mind is that he has projected his problem onto me. And for the entire four years since I left the marriage I've been abused and harassed through texts, emails. I've had to cut him off talking to him. And this past June I told him I wasn't texting him at all, I was never talking to him again, and he's threatened me to file for modification to take my younger daughter away from me over and over. 
 
 LAUER: What do you -- what do you want to see here, Hillary ? Do you want him to get help? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Yes, exactly. 
 
 LAUER: What is the outcome you're looking for? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: I think he's been punished enough just by seeing this go public like this and I think he just really needs help and rehabilitation. We need to get him counseling or something. 
 
 LAUER: Do you have any regrets, by the way, of releasing this now, now that this has gone so public and so many people have watched it? Any regrets? 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: Well, I regret that some of my friends and some people close to me have kind of had trouble with this, and of course I regret that it's my own father. I'm having very mixed feelings about that. But at the same time, so many people are telling me that I did the right thing. So there have -- definitely different emotions. 
 
 LAUER: Hillary and Hallie Adams . Thank you so much . We appreciate you both being here. We'll follow this story. 
 
 Ms. HILLARY ADAMS: OK, thank you, Matt. 
 
 Ms. HALLIE ADAMS: Thank you. ||||| Do you think it's acceptable to spank your child with a belt as punishment? 
 
 Aransas County Judge William Adams claims, """"It's not as bad as it looks on tape."" 
 
 Police say the Texas judge videotaped brutally beating his disabled daughter with a belt over Internet music downloads will not face charges, as the statutes of limitations for the charges he likely would have faced has passed. 
 
 The statute of limitations for the most-likely assault charges is five years, Rockport police told the Associated Press. William Adams' abuse of his daughter was videotaped seven years ago. 
 
 He will face an official State Commission on Judicial Conduct and could be forced to step down from the bench. In the meantime, Adams is on paid leave and may have left town in the wake of death threats. 
 
 His daughter, Hillary Adams, who uploaded the shocking video of her being viciously whipped with a belt, said Thursday she waited seven years to go public out of fear for her family. 
 
 In a ""Today"" show interview, , Adams, now 23, said she recorded the 2004 beating in her room with a hidden camera after her father’s ""abuse and harassment"" escalated. 
 
 ""I waited seven years because back then I was still a minor and living under his roof and releasing it then, I don't know what would've happened to me and my mother and my little sister,"" said Adams, who suffers from cerebral palsy. ""So waiting until today, seven years later, was about me being able to pull away and distance myself from the consequences."" 
 
 With her mother by her side, Adams told “Today’s” Matt Lauer that she hoped her father, Judge William Adams, wouldn't lose his job as a result. 
 
 “I think [my father] has been punished enough just by seeing this go public like this, and I think he just really needs help and rehabilitation,"" Adams said. 
 
 ""Judge Adams has agreed he'll have a visiting judge for the near future,"" Aransas County Judge Burt Mills told Corpos Christi's KRISTV. ""I don't know yet [how long he’ll be gone\] but he'll not take the bench for a while."" 
 
 The video, uploaded to YouTube on Oct. 27, shows William Adams berating and savagely beating his teenage daughter with a belt, flogging her in the legs and sides of her body. ||||| A family law judge whose daughter secretly videotaped him savagely beating her seven years ago won't face criminal charges because too much time has elapsed, police said.

 Aransas County Court-at-Law Judge William Adams likely would have been charged with causing injury to a child or other assault-related offenses for the 2004 beating of his then-16-year-old daughter, but the five-year statutes of limitations expired, Rockport Police Chief Tim Jayroe said Thursday. 
 
 ""We believe that there was a criminal offense involved and that there was substantial evidence to indicate that and under normal circumstances ... a charge could have been made,"" Jayroe said. He said the district attorney determined he couldn't bring charges, and that police would discuss the case with federal prosecutors even though he doesn't believe federal charges would apply. 
 
 Hillary Adams, now 23, posted the 8-minute clip on YouTube last week that shows her father viciously lashing her with a belt and trying to force her to bend over her bed to be beaten despite her wails and pleas to stop. The clip had received more than 2.4 million hits as of Thursday, and police began investigating Wednesday after hearing from concerned citizens. 
 
 William Adams, 51, issued a three-page statement Thursday saying his daughter posted the clip to get back at him for telling her he would be reducing the amount of financial support he gives her and taking away her Mercedes. The statement did not include an apology for the beating, but he told Corpus Christi television station KZTV on Wednesday that the video ""looks worse than it is,"" that he had already apologized to his daughter and that he was just disciplining his child for stealing. 
 
 Hillary Adams says her parents were angry because she had downloaded pirated content online, and that she turned on the camera because she sensed something was going to happen. 
 
 William Adams, who presides over child abuse cases, is still being investigated by the state's judicial conduct commission and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which on Thursday requested that he be removed from its cases until the investigation concludes. 
 
 Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for the agency, declined to elaborate on the exact nature of the investigation. But he said that in general, the agency would only investigate a case in which a suspected abuse victim has already reached adulthood if there are still children in the home who could be at risk. Adams was granted joint custody of his 10-year-old daughter in his 2007 divorce. 
 
 There are no allegations of alleged abuse by Adams against his younger daughter, who primarily resides with her mother, Hallie Adams. Crimmins declined to say whether his agency is investigating the parental fitness of Hallie Adams, who lashed Hillary once during the 2004 beating. 
 
 Crimmins said his agency ordinarily wouldn't disclose that it is investigating someone, but that it did in this case because the investigation is the reason it requested that William Adams be taken off its cases. 
 
 Jayroe said that police did not interview the younger daughter, but asked both Hallie and Hillary Adams about it and there was no indication of abuse of the younger daughter. 
 
 In his statement Thursday, Adams said he would ""respond"" to all investigations. As Aransas County's top judge, he has dealt with at least 349 family law cases in the past year alone, nearly 50 of which involved state caseworkers seeking determine whether parents were fit to raise their children. 
 
 County officials confirmed that Adams will not hear cases related to Child Protective Services for at least the next two weeks. And the top administrator in Aransas County cast doubt on whether Adams could credibly return to the bench. 
 
 ""I would think it would be very difficult,"" said Aransas County Judge C.H. ""Burt"" Mills Jr. ""Personally I don't see how he can recover from this."" 
 
 If the judicial commission and police investigations don't lead to punishment or charges, Adams could be safe on the bench until he's up for re-election in three years. 
 
 Hillary Adams said she waited so long to expose her father because she was terrified at what might have happened had she done so while still living under his roof. She said the outpouring of support and encouragement she's received since posting the clip is tempered by the sadness that it's her father repeatedly lashing her with a belt and threatening to beat her ""into submission."" 
 
 During an interview with her and her mother Thursday on NBC's ""Today"" show, Hillary Adams said her father regularly beat her for a period of time. She has repeatedly said she didn't post the clip to spite her father, and that she hopes it forces him to seek help. 
 
 Her mother blamed her ex-husband's bouts of violence on an ""addiction."" She called it a ""family secret,"" but declined to elaborate. 
 
 In his statement, though, William Adams painted a starkly different picture of why his daughter posted the clip. 
 
 ""Just prior to the YouTube upload, a concerned father shared with his 23-year-old daughter that he was unwilling to continue to work hard and be her primary source of financial support, if she was going to simply `drop out,' and strive to achieve no more in life than to work part time at a video game store,"" Adams' statement said. ""Hillary warned her father if he reduced her financial support, and took away her Mercedes automobile, which her father had provided, he would live to regret it."" 
 
 Hillary Adams did not immediately respond to email requests Thursday seeking a response.

 Associated Press writer Danny Robbins in Dallas contributed to this report.","– A Texas judge filmed in a viral video beating his disabled daughter won't face criminal charges because the five-year statutes of limitations has expired, say police. Though the beating occurred several years ago, daughter Hillary Adams, who suffers from cerebral palsy, said she was afraid to post the film any earlier because she feared retribution by her dad. ""I waited seven years because back then I was still a minor and living under his roof, and releasing it then, I don't know what would've happened to me and my mother and my little sister,"" Adams, now 23, said on the Today Show.

 Google Inc. rose after reorganizing into a holding company called Alphabet Inc., breaking out its main Web operations from ambitious new endeavors such as research lab Google X and Calico, which seeks to extend human lives. 
 
 The structure, announced Monday, will give greater clarity into how Google invests in various ventures, including driverless cars, high-speed Internet service and health-related technologies. It also makes it easier to make any future acquisitions or potential divestments. 
 
 “There’s been a lot of speculation about how much money they put into these other ventures,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. “That will come to an end. This also gives them the structure to add in another business line if they were to acquire something. The mechanism is in place.”

 Shares of Google gained 4.1 percent to $690.30 at the close in New York. The stock has climbed 30 percent this year, with much of the gain coming after the company reported quarterly results last month. 
 
 The goal isn’t to make Alphabet a consumer brand, said Larry Page, co-founder and current chief executive officer, who will hold that title at Alphabet. Co-founder Sergey Brin will be president. Ruth Porat will remain chief financial officer of the holding company. Sundar Pichai, Page’s deputy, will be promoted to CEO of Google Inc., which generates the bulk of the company’s $60 billion in annual revenue. 
 
 New Structure 
 
 Omid Kordestani will transition from his role as chief business officer to become an adviser to Alphabet and Google. 
 
 “Sergey and Larry will be able to allocate their time differently between the core and non-core businesses,” said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. “You have Sundar focusing on the core business, and you will have Larry and Sergey kind of looking at the future growth businesses.” 
 
 The new structure will be introduced in phases in the coming months. Alphabet will give its results as a holding company starting with the fourth-quarter earnings report, which is usually released in January. 
 
 With this move, investors will get more details on how the businesses are operating, a longstanding concern on Wall Street. Spending on projects that include everything from driverless cars to chip-embedded contact lenses has rankled investors, who aren’t sure how long it will take for the efforts to pay off.

 “We’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes,” Page wrote in the post. “Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable.” 
 
 For anyone who owns shares of Google now, no action is required. The stock will automatically convert into Alphabet shares that represent stakes in the same collection of companies that exists today, just arranged differently. The change won’t require a shareholder vote or create any extra taxes. 
 
 “The conversion will occur automatically without an exchange of stock certificates,” according to a regulatory filing. “Stock certificates previously representing shares of a class of Google stock will represent the same number of shares of the corresponding class of Alphabet stock.”

 While Alphabet may be an unusual choice for a multibillion-dollar Web conglomerate, it’s more mundane than the company’s name, which was considered odd before it become a household term. Page and Brin adopted Google, a misspelling of the large number Googol (1 followed by 100 zeroes), when they founded the Web-search company in 1998. 
 
 “We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity’s most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search!” Page said. “We also like that it means alpha-bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!” |||||

GOOGL, +1.74% announced late Monday that it will create a new organizational structure, with an umbrella company dubbed Alphabet Inc. that co-founder and Chief Executive Larry Page will lead. Sundar Pichai, who was in charge of two of Google's most important products, Android and Chrome, will take over the CEO role at Google. ""Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights,"" Page said in Monday's announcement. Google shares gained 4% in late trading after closing with a 0.2% loss at $663.14. 
 
 Read the full story: Google announces new structure, with Alphabet as parent firm","– Big changes at Google today: Its founders have a created a parent company for it called Alphabet and will focus on running that. Google itself will still exist, but in a ""slimmed down"" version that will be run by current Google exec Sundar Pichai, writes Larry Page in a company blog post. Co-founder Sergey Brin will be Alphabet's president. Essentially, Google is separating its ""search, YouTube, and other Web companies from its research and investment divisions,"" explains Bloomberg. Google is, in fact, disappearing in one sense: Alphabet will replace it as the publicly traded entity, reports MarketWatch. Shares were up nearly 6% on news of the restructuring. Part of Page's explanation: ""What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity)."" Also included will be the X lab and Wing, the company's drone project, reports the Wall Street Journal. “Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related,” writes Page.","<pad> Google Inc. rose after reorganizing into a holding company called Alphabet Inc., breaking out its main Web operations from ambitious new endeavors such as research lab Google X and Calico, which seeks to extend human lives.</s>",0.14507771710811035,0.007843134718647494,0.13471502280759223

 In putting together its annual list of the world’s most reputable companies, RI assigns each company a score – The RepTrak Pulse – ascertained by taking into account the esteem, trust, admiration and feelings the general public has for each company in seven categories. Ratings are based on online polls of more than 240,000 people in 15 countries, such as China, the United States, Germany, Russia, Brazil and others. 
 
 Of the 100 companies in the survey (identified by taking the best-scoring companies from markets around the world that also score well worldwide), Rolex managed to place in the top ten among poll respondents in 11 nations—more than any other company. Sony (which came in 9th overall) scored in the top ten in 10 nations. Rolex has indeed been consistent as of late, placing in the top five most reputable companies for the past three years, as have other household-name firms like Google, Walt Disney and BMW. 
 
 “Around the world, (Rolex) has a consistently strong to excellent reputation,” says Kasper Ulf Nielsen, Executive Partner at RI, “Being number one in the world – which is a summary of fifteen countries – it shows that you are strong to excellent throughout the world—it’s not enough to be excellent in a few markets.” 
 
 The area where Rolex scored highest among respondents (a score of 82.2) was in products and services, proving that the general population has high regard for the company’s wares and its willingness to stand behind its product. Rolex also scored highly in performance, innovation, workplace and governance – among other categories – generally getting high marks across the board. 
 
 Another strong performer on this year’s list was The Walt Disney Company, which scored higher in the citizenship and governance categories. Says Nielsen: “The Walt Disney Company is number one in the world when it comes to being perceived as a good corporate citizen and also as a company with fair and ethical business practices.” 
 
 One firm that saw a dropoff in reputation was Volkswagen. Following scandalous allegations of cheating on emissions testing and the subsequent resignation of its chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, the company’s good name took a noticeable hit, dropping from 14th place, with a RepTrak score of 75 last year, to 123rd place in 2016, with a mediocre score of 61.3. 
 
 But how do a strong reputation and the admiration of the general populace translate to sales? According to Reputation Institute, companies with higher RepTrak Pulse scores are more likely to have their goods or services recommended by their customers. For a company on the list, improving a RepTrak Pulse score by five points can increase the likelihood of customer recommendations by 8.5%. 
 
 Also, companies that rated average on RI’s score chart (with a RepTrak Pulse score of between 60 and 69) saw only about 35% of respondents willing to buy their products. Companies that scored between 70 and 79 saw that willingness to buy jump up to an average of 55%. “In a world where companies are fighting for market share,” says Nielsen, “this is showing us that reputation is an avenue to improve the recommendations you get from consumers.” 
 
 The importance of the personal recommendation has grown in recent years, Nielsen says, likely because people have generally lost trust in institutions like governments and corporations—they expect to be disappointed and hold quality in higher regard when they find it. “And that means that if you’re able to stand out as a company that is trusted, you get an accelerated level of support.” That support, he added, can lead to increased sales and profit.","– The Reputation Institute is out with its annual list of the world's most reputable companies, based on a poll of 240,000 people from 15 countries.

239,"Workers digging a well outside the city of Xi'an, China, in 1974 struck upon one of the greatest archaeological discoveries in the world: a life-size clay soldier poised for battle. 
 
 The diggers notified Chinese authorities, who dispatched government archaeologists to the site. 
 
 They found not one, but thousands of clay soldiers, each with unique facial expressions and positioned according to rank. And though largely gray today, patches of paint hint at once brightly colored clothes. Further excavations have revealed swords, arrow tips, and other weapons, many in pristine condition. 
 
 The soldiers are in trenchlike, underground corridors. In some of the corridors, clay horses are aligned four abreast; behind them are wooden chariots. 
 
 The terra-cotta army, as it is known, is part of an elaborate mausoleum created to accompany the first emperor of China into the afterlife, according to archaeologists. 
 
 China's Terra-Cotta Warriors 
 
 Young Emperor 
 
 Ying Zheng took the throne in 246 B.C. at the age of 13. By 221 B.C. he had unified a collection of warring kingdoms and took the name of Qin Shi Huang Di—the First Emperor of Qin. 
 
 During his rule, Qin standardized coins, weights, and measures; interlinked the states with canals and roads; and is credited for building the first version of the Great Wall. 
 
 According to writings of court historian Siam Qian during the following Han dynasty, Qin ordered the mausoleum's construction shortly after taking the throne. More than 700,000 laborers worked on the project, which was halted in 209 B.C. amid uprisings a year after Qin's death. 
 
 To date, four pits have been partially excavated. Three are filled with the terra-cotta soldiers, horse-drawn chariots, and weapons. The fourth pit is empty, a testament to the original unfinished construction. 
 
 Archaeologists estimate the pits may contain as many as 8,000 figures, but the total may never be known. 
 
 Unexcavated Tomb 
 
 Qin's tomb itself remains unexcavated, though Siam Qian's writings suggest even greater treasures. 
 
 ""The tomb was filled with models of palaces, pavilions and offices as well as fine vessels, precious stones and rarities,"" reads a translation of the text. 
 
 The account indicates the tomb contains replicas of the area's rivers and streams made with mercury flowing to the sea through hills and mountains of bronze. Precious stones such as pearls are said to represent the sun, moon, and other stars. 
 
 Modern tests on the tomb mound have revealed unusually high concentrations of mercury, lending credence to at least some of the historical account. 
 
 Chinese archaeologists are also using remote-sensing technology to probe the tomb mound. The technique recently revealed an underground chamber with four stairlike walls. An archaeologist working on the site told the Chinese press that the chamber may have been built for the soul of the emperor. 
 
 Experimental pits dug around the tomb have revealed dancers, musicians, and acrobats full of life and caught in mid-performance, a sharp contrast to the military poses of the famous terra-cotta soldiers. 
 
 But further excavations of the tomb itself are on hold, at least for now. ||||| FILE - In this July 30, 2013 file photo, visitors walk past a display of the unearthed Terra Cotta Warriors cast by sunlight at the excavation site inside the No.1 pit of the Museum of Qin Terracotta... (Associated Press) 
 
 BEIJING (AP) — China is expanding the ranks of the famed Terra Cotta Warrior army with new excavations expected to yield hundreds more of the ancient life-size figures. 
 
 The museum overseeing the vast mausoleum of China's first emperor says it began work March 30 on the tomb's No. 2 pit that is smaller in scale but believed to be richer in archaeological value than the already excavated No. 1 pit. 
 
 Along with 1,400 warrior and horse statues, the pit is believed to contain 89 war chariots and 116 mounted soldiers, offering invaluable insights into the military culture of the Qin dynasty, the museum said in a statement on its website. 
 
 ""The No. 2 pit contains the true essence of the Terra Cotta army,"" the museum's former curator was quoted as saying. 
 
 Discovered in 1974, the army is one of China's biggest tourist draws, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. In recent years, the warriors have joined the giant panda as a tool of Chinese ""soft power,"" with several batches being exhibited overseas to enthusiastic crowds. 
 
 The army was built to guard the tomb of the first Qin emperor, Qin Shi Huang, who died in 210 A.D. after conquering much of what is now modern China. 
 
 In all, the tomb's three pits are thought to hold more than 8,000 figures of archers, infantry soldiers, mounted cavalry, horse-drawn chariots, officers, acrobats, musicians and others. 
 
 The pits is adjacent to the emperor's sprawling mausoleum that lies under a 76-meter (250-foot) mound and remains un-excavated as experts debate the pros and cons of doing so. 
 
 Ancient accounts tell of a huge complex of chambers, including underground rivers filled with flowing mercury, along with the remains of craftsmen and imperial concubines sealed alive in the tomb with the dead emperor. 
 
 The Terra Cotta statues weigh about 180 kilograms (400 pounds) each and range in height up to 183-195 centimeters (6 feet to 6 feet 5 inches) depending on rank. Generals are the tallest. 
 
 Originally brightly painted, they are intricately detailed with armor, top knots, weapons and boots. No two figures are alike, and craftsmen are believed to have modeled them after a real army. 
 
 A ruthless figure of fear and awe in Chinese history, Qin built an extensive system of roads and canals along with an early incarnation of the Great Wall of China while unifying measurements and establishing a single written language, currency and legal statutes. ||||| An archaeologist works on an excavation site of terracotta warriors in Xi’an April 30, 2015.[Photo/Xinhua] 
 
 XI'AN - China launched a second excavation project on Thursday on a burial pit in the ancient capital of Xi'an, where an army of terracotta warriors guards the mausoleum of China's first emperor. 
 
 Archaeologists plan to excavate about 200 square meters of Pit No.2, located near the tomb of Emperor Qinshihuang, founder of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), according to Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum. 
 
 Archaeologist Yuan Zhongyi estimated that the burial pit has 1,400 clay figures and horses and 89 chariots waiting to be unearthed. 
 
 Yuan described Pit No.2 as ""the essence of the terracotta warriors,"" for its mix of terracotta chariots, cavalry and archers. 
 
 ""You can find all the kneeling archers, soldiers and cavalry in the No.2 pit,"" Yuan said. ""Their colorful paint is also relatively well preserved."" 
 
 The No.2 pit was famed for the unearthing of several colorful warriors, including a rare specimen with a green face, indicating that the army was once painted various colors that faded throughout the ages. 
 
 Located in Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the 56-square-km Mausoleum of Qinshihuang is the world's largest underground mausoleum. An army of more than 7,000 life-sized terracotta warriors and horses was discovered at the site in 1974. 
 
 First excavation began on Pit No.2 in 1994 and was halted in 2008 due to a lack of personnel and advanced protective technologies.","– A new excavation of something branded the ""No. 2 pit"" is a potentially much more remarkable undertaking than it sounds: It could swell the ranks of China's famed terracotta army. Work began March 30 on the pit, which sits adjacent to the tomb mound of Qin Shi Huang, an emperor who conquered much of modern China before his death in 210 BC. That pit has seen previous excavations, between 1994 and 2008, reports the Xinhua News Agency, and gave up statues whose coloring led archaeologists to conclude the clay warriors were originally painted. What they expect a 2,150-square-foot section of the pit to give up now: as many as 1,400 warrior and horse statues, 89 war chariots, and 116 mounted soldiers, the AP reports by way of the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum. Those warriors would add to the 7,000 that were found at the site—the world's biggest underground mausoleum—since 1974. The No. 2 pit is thought to be a more archaeologically interesting site than the already excavated No. 1, with archaeologist Yuan Zhongyi describing the No. 2 as holding ""the true essence of the terracotta army,"" noting the ""colorful paint is also relatively well preserved."" National Geographic's file on the terracotta warriors reports there are four pits that have seen some excavation, including one that was found to be empty, ""a testament to the original unfinished construction.""

Now Santa is really getting to the bottom of barrel of potential sleigh draggers. A bioluminescent species of clusterwink snail (Hinea brasiliana) may use its light producing ability to make itself look bigger and startle off predators. Santa has to deliver presents to children all over the world. He could never make it using snails to pull his sled. It looks like no other animals are up for the challenge of leading Santa's reindeer through a foggy Christmas Eve. No wonder he's the most famous reindeer of all. PHOTOS: What Glows in the Night 
 
 One of the most familiar of luminescent creatures, the firefly, has some distinct advantages over its rivals for Rudolph's job. For one thing, they can already fly. Plus, they produce their own light and don't need any UV-light sources or genetic engineering to help them out. Each species of firefly has a distinct sequence of flashes it uses to find a mate. But the frisky firefly better beware. Carnivorous fireflies can mimic their relatives' flash patterns. By copying the flash pattern of a female, they invite a male firefly over for a dinner date. The unsuspecting male ends up as the dinner. Just think of how sad the world's children would be if their toys were delayed because an amorous insect got himself eaten! For all their flying and glowing advantages, fireflies might be more trouble than they're worth for Kris Kringle. 
 
 Santa has to deliver presents to some pretty rough parts of the world. He might need some protection. The bright glow of a scorpion leading the way would surely keep the jolly old elf safe from sleigh-jackers. Scorpions naturally glow under UV-light. Entomologists use this to find the creatures at night by searching the desert with portable UV- lights. Scientists aren't completely sure why the scorpions glow. It may be that the glow is a by product of their exoskeletons chemical structure. Or it could be part of the mechanism they use to avoid coming out in daylight or during the full moon. But sadly scorpions will probably have to go on the naughty list. Children would simply be afraid if the patter of reindeer hooves was replaced by the skittering of scorpion claws on the roof. 
 
 While the elves have their diving gear on to wrangle squid, they may as well pick up a few glowing sharks. The largest of fish, the whale shark, has spots on its back that shine brightly in the sunlight. Every whale shark has a different pattern of spots, which ichthyologists use to identify individuals. Santa wouldn't have any trouble telling the sharks apart, and the giant fish would surely be able to haul the weight of all the world's presents. Lantern sharks and smalleye pygmy sharks are both shrimps compared to the whale shark at less 30 centimeters in length. But they have a bright idea that may keep them safe from predators and could guide Santa's sleigh. Studies by Julien Claes of the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium proved the sharks, like squid, have photophores on their bellies that were capable of producing light. Hormonal signals caused the shark’s underside to glow. The lights may help disguise the shark's silhouette from predators looking up towards the light filtering down from the surface. The lights may also aid in communication. But landing a whaleshark on a rooftop may be too big of a challenge, even if the elves could figure out how to keep the fish alive out of water. NEWS: Glowing Shark Wears Cloak of Invisibility 
 
 If Santa’s looking for an animal that is both unappealing as a pet and hasn’t been obliterated off the face of the planet by molten magma, perhaps a squid would do swimmingly. Numerous species of squid and octopi can change their colors for camouflage or communication. Some squid live at the very bottom of the sea, where very little of the sun's light reaches. In the inky depths, the creatures produce their own light for a variety of reasons, including attracting prey and communicating. Jules Verne and Peter Benchley may have given squid a naughty reputation, but some squid have been observed tenderly caring for their unhatched eggs. The nurturing instincts of the squid mothers fit with Santa's style and having all those tentacles could help with wrapping presents and other holiday chores. The glowing squid shown here, Watasenia scintillans, has special organs called photophores that allow it to light up. Plus, this species is edible. So, in a pinch, Santa could stuff a stocking with calamari. The problem is, they simply can't survive outside of the water, much less at the high altitudes reached by Santa's sleigh. PHOTOS: Squid, Glowing Bacteria Work Well Together 
 
 If brilliant beagles and fluorescent felines were too cute, perhaps Santa would be better off with an animal few kids want to cuddle. Glowing roaches could guide the sleigh and would have no trouble getting down the chimney. No luck here though, the incandescent insects’ lights may have been snuffed out permanently by a volcano. The roach was only known from a single specimen collected more than 70 years ago in Ecuador. Since then an eruption of the Tungurahua volcano may have wiped out the only known habitat for the insect. Oh well, Mrs. Claus probably wouldn’t have liked Santa bringing roaches around the house, anyway. ANALYSIS: Volcano Vaporizes Cool Glowing Roach 
 
 If Santa doesn't want to monkey around with glowing simians, perhaps he can use the fluorescent felines created by Mayo Clinic researchers to help in the fight against HIV-AIDS. The cats were genetically engineered to carry a protein that defends them from infection by the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), the cat version of HIV. The cats glow because of the jellyfish gene was inserted along with the FIV-resistance gene. If the genetically modified mouser glowed an eerie green, the researchers knew it was also resistant to FIV. ""One of the best things about this biomedical research is that it is aimed at benefiting both human and feline health,"" said Eric Poeschla, lead author of the study published in Nature Methods, in a press release. ""It can help cats as much as people.” Santa would have a ready supply of milk for the cats, what with all the cookies and milk left for him. Unfortunately, cats have proven remarkably difficult to herd. Getting them to pull a sleigh would be too much of a challenge for Santa’s elves. Glowing cats are better fit for Halloween anyway. 
 
 Dogs do a good job hauling sleds around in the Arctic, so they already have on the job experience. However, dogs don't naturally shine. Recently though, a genetically modified beagle was designed to glow. A gene from the jellyfish species Aequorea victoria that causes them to glow, or fluoresce, under ultraviolet light was inserted into the the beagle. In further studies, the genetically modified mutts could have disease-causing genes inserted along with the glowing genes. That would allow scientists to know which dogs had picked up the disease causing genes by shining a UV light on the animals. ""The dog has 268 genetic type diseases that are similar to those of humans,"" study co-author ByeongChun Lee told Discovery News’ Jennifer Viegas. ""Also, the dog has physiological and anatomical similarities with humans. These reasons make them a good model for human disease."" The only problem is the bright-bodied beagle, named Tegon, is adorable. If Santa’s sleigh was pulled by a frisky little beagle, too many kids would want to keep the pup as a present. Plus the dog might raid Santa’s cookies and milk. NEWS: Genetically Modified Beagle Glows 
 
 When all of the other reindeer used to laugh and call Rudolph names, like Pinocchio, he had to take their abuse and accept being excluded from their reindeer games, like Monopoly. What if Rudolph with his nose-so-bright refused to guide Santa's sleigh in retaliation for the abuse he had faced from dull-nosed reindeer? Would another reindeer be able to fill in for Rudolph? After all, he isn't the only red-nosed reindeer. Certain reindeer in the Norwegian Arctic have naturally pink noses. Reindeer noses have 25 percent more capillaries than the human nose, according to a recent study published in the journal BMJ. The reddish coloration of the animals noses results from the high concentration of blood vessels. The red-nosed reindeer lacked one important feature. Their noses, although useful in regulating body heat, were unable to glow. A Rudolph rebellion could indeed cancel Christmas for Santa unless he can find a truly illuminating animal. Santa will need to check out the resumes of some other glowing creatures. ANALYSIS: Why Some Reindeer Have Red Noses 
 
 Reindeer populations worldwide are decreasing, according to the authors of a new study who hope that measures soon will be taken to save the majestic and iconic winter holiday animals. 
 
 Strengthening reindeer populations would have far reaching effects, according to the study, published in the Journal for Nature Conservation. Ecosystems, local economies and even climate change are just some of the matters that could be impacted, and not just in the northernmost polar region. 
 
 ""Reindeer occur in the northern part of the Arctic and subarctic region,"" lead author Xiuxiang Meng explained to Discovery News. ""In northern Europe (such as in Finland, Sweden and Norway), Asia (Russia, Mongolia and China) and North America (Canada and Alaska), reindeer populations have been declining for many years."" 
 
 Play Video How Snowflakes Form As the saying goes, each snowflake is different. And chances are that saying is right! 
 
 Meng, a professor at Renmin University's School of Environment and Natural Resources, and his colleagues further note that there are two subspecies of reindeer in the world: tundra reindeer and woodland reindeer. Some are wild or feral, while others are considered to be ""semi-domesticated."" The various types, also known as caribou, appear to be experiencing population decreases. 
 
 The researchers focused their study on reindeer in China, since the hoofed mammal's population there has declined at least 28 percent since the 1970s. Meng and his team said that reindeer in China originated from Siberia about 2000 years ago, migrating with the Ewenki people, who have been called ""the last hunting tribe of China."" 
 
 The Ewenki have never tamed or fully domesticated the reindeer, which feed on their own. People just provide basic herd management, such as provisioning the animals with salt. The Ewenki benefit from the reindeer's meat, hides, antlers, milk and other things. 
 
 The researchers, however, believe that at least six factors are causing the reindeer population to decline. The first is inbreeding. Since reindeer populations here and in other locations are low, there is a greater risk for genetic deterioration. The second factor is poaching, often for the very same antlers that grab our attention on holiday cards. 
 
 The third are natural predators. As the scientists mention, ""Bears, wolves and lynx are the three main predators of reindeer, and may kill as many as a third of reindeer calves each year."" 
 
 Lack of herders and breeders, climate change, and changes to the tourism industry round out the list. To attract more tourists, herders have been moving closer to where people tend to congregate, putting reindeer at risk from traffic, the aforementioned poaching and other problems. 
 
 Achyut Aryal, a researcher at Massey University, echoed the concerns. He told Discovery News that disease is yet another threat to reindeer populations worldwide. 
 
 Both he and Meng believe that the IUCN Red List Data on reindeer needs to be updated. As it stands, reindeer are classified as being of ""least concern,"" in terms of their conservation status. This is based on a 2008 assessment. 
 
 ""The semi-domesticated (reindeer) population in China, Mongolia and Russia—and especially China—should be given enough concern by the IUCN Red List,"" Meng said. ""Our survey showed that the reindeer in China comprise the southernmost reindeer population in the world, which is so important to the distribution and conservation of reindeer worldwide."" 
 
 Meng and his team are working on yet another study to determine how reindeer herding first emerged in the world. They have data supporting that reindeer herding originated in forests located in Russia, Mongolia and China. ||||| The reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) is listed as a species of “least concern” on the Red List of Threatened Species of the World Conservation Union (IUCN). It is distributed in the northern part of China and semi-domesticated in the region. Here we present a comparison of the historical and current distribution and numbers of reindeer in China, as well as an assessment of the factors limiting population growth. Based on this information we explore potential protective measures for reindeer in China. 
 
 The reindeer has been herded extensively by the Ewenki people, the only people to do so in China. Reindeer in China originated from the Wenduosenlin tundra highlands of Siberia. Capable of migrating more than 3000 km/year, the reindeer moved from the highlands to the Weitimu river during the 16th century and on to the Northeast area of China in 1654. Since 1957, 600 reindeer have settled in Qiqian in Inner Mongolia, and from 1965 more than 900 reindeer migrated from there to Mangui. In response to frequent flooding and a fluctuating reindeer population in the Mangui region, in 2003 the Ewenki people and more than 260 reindeer translocated from there to Aoluguya. 
 
 Currently, eight meta-populations of reindeer comprising 773 individuals inhabit in the Arctic region of China. The reindeer population peaked in the 1970s at more than 1080 animals, but declined markedly from 1998 onwards mainly as a result of inbreeding, poaching, predation and tourism. The Chinese government's interest in wildlife protection is increasing, as evidenced by the introduction of wildlife protection laws and regulations, the importation of new reindeer varieties from Russia and the joining of the Association of World Reindeer Herders. However, natural reserves and national parks have still not been established within the reindeer's range in China to conserve this fragile population. ||||| Reindeer populations worldwide have decreased markedly since 1998, a new study says.

 BEIJING, Dec. 9 (UPI) -- Reindeer populations across the globe are decreasing due to inbreeding and poaching, researchers at a university in China said. 
 
 A study published in the Journal for Nature Conservation focused on two subspecies -- tundra reindeer and woodland reindeer -- which have declined in population by at least 28 percent since the 1970s. The decline increased markedly in 1998. 
 
 ""In northern Europe (such as in Finland, Sweden and Norway), Asia (Russia, Mongolia and China) and North America (Canada and Alaska), reindeer populations have been declining for many years,"" lead author Xiuxiang Meng told Discovery News. 
 
 The study, written by researchers from China's Renmin University School of Environment and Natural Resources, blamed the population decrease on six factors, including inbreeding, poaching, natural predators, lack of herders and breeders, climate change, and changes to the tourism industry. 
 
 ""Bears, wolves and lynx are the three main predators of reindeer, and may kill as many as a third of reindeer calves each year,"" the report says. 
 
 ""The semi-domesticated (reindeer) population in China, Mongolia and Russia -- and especially China -- should be given enough concern by the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) Red List,"" Xiuxiang said. ""Our survey showed that the reindeer in China comprise the southernmost reindeer population in the world, which is so important to the distribution and conservation of reindeer worldwide.""","– The iconic reindeer is in peril, according to a new study analyzing population trends in China. While their numbers have been in decline for decades, dropping by at least 28% since the 1970s, the rate of decline has increased dramatically since 1998, reports UPI. The study, published in the Journal for Nature Conservation, puts the number of reindeer in the ""Arctic region of China"" at 773; the 1970s peak was 1,080. The researchers point to six factors contributing to the sinking numbers there: inbreeding, poaching, natural predators, lack of herders and breeders, climate change, and changes in the tourism industry. Another researcher adds disease to the list. They say the IUCN Red List Data on reindeer is out of date; the animals are still listed under their 2008 classification as being of ""least concern.""

241,"Getting divorced was the greatest thing that ever happened to Julia Roberts’ character in Eat Pray Love: The aftermath involves getting down with James Franco and Javier Bardem, not to mention copious amounts of gelato and pizza, and, if the trailer is to be believed, finding “your truth” at the “center” of your life. The movie is based on the book of the same name by Elizabeth Gilbert (which has been criticized for glossing over the messier parts of divorce). But who wants mess when you can revive the great ‘70s film trope: the woman liberated by ditching her husband. 
 
 Hollywood has been grappling with divorce since before there were talkies, says film critic David Thomson. Cecil B. Demille, he points out, made a number of films with Gloria Swanson that were flirting with the idea. But those films, like Don’t Change Your Husband(1919), and Why Change Your Wife? (1920) can’t quite let the women revel in their newfound freedom and truly move on. In Why Change Your Wife?, Swanson plays Beth Gordon, a nerdy woman whose husband leaves her for a glitzier babe. Rather than move on with her life, Gordon decides to get a makeover and wins her husband back. 
 
 In the ‘30s and ‘40s, comedies of remarriage like The Philadelphia Story were in fashion. As Willa Paskin described the genre in a Double X article from last year, these rom-coms “dissect the institution and then build it back up again.” The films often begin with a divorce, and then the divided pair ends up back together. Although the female characters in these films are often independent, sassy dames, the genre is an affirmation that happiness comes from the institution. 
 
 The trope of the woman emancipated by divorce didn’t really take hold until the ‘70s—this isn’t surprising, as divorce rates increased exponentially during that decade, as part of a wave of “self-actualization.” An Unmarried Woman, starring Jill Clayburgh as Erica, a jilted Upper East Side wife, is the epitome of the ‘70s divorce-liberation flick: The film turns “the heroine’s unwedded status into a positive growth experience,” according to the New York Times. She even shacks up with the requisite ‘70s “sensitive bearded artist.” 
 
 In the intervening 30 years, many movies have portrayed women in the throes of post-divorce self-discovery. The process has some familiar steps, including dancing in various flattering, decade-appropriate outfits (An Unmarried Woman, Living Out Loud), destroying your ex-husband’s possessions (Waiting To Exhale, The First Wives Club), doing recreational drugs (Living Out Loud, It’s Complicated) and traveling to foreign lands to meet hunky dudes (How Stella Got Her Groove Back, Under the Tuscan Sun, and of course, Eat Pray Love). Herewith, a slide show of ladies who are loving life, sans husband.

 Judge Thokozile Masipa said prosecutors have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Pistorius, 27, is guilty of premeditated murder. 
 
 ""Culpable homicide is a competent verdict,"" the judge said, but did not deliver any formal verdicts in the shooting death of Pistorius' 29-year-old girlfriend before calling for a lunch break in the proceedings. 
 
 Culpable homicide refers to a negligent killing. If Pistorius is formally acquitted of murder, he could still be sent to jail for years if it's found he acted negligently in Steenkamp's death. Pistorius has admitted firing the four shots that killed Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. 
 
 Pistorius says he mistook his girlfriend, a model and budding reality TV star, for an intruder and killed her accidentally. The prosecution alleges the athlete intentionally killed her after a loud argument, which was heard by neighbors. 
 
 Masipa was explaining her reasoning behind the upcoming verdicts in the case against Pistorius. Masipa said there were ""just not enough facts"" to support the finding of premeditated murder in Steenkamp's fatal shooting. 
 
 As the judge spoke, Pistorius wept quietly, his shoulders shaking as he sat on a wooden bench. 
 
 Masipa earlier told Pistorius he could remain seated on a wooden bench while she read her verdict out and until she asked him to stand. She then proceeded to explain her assessment of the testimonies of some of the 37 witnesses who testified. The process 
 
 Casting doubt on witness accounts of hearing a woman's screams, Masipa said ""none of the witnesses had ever heard the accused cry or scream, let alone when he was anxious,"" apparently acknowledging the possibility that the defense argument that Pistorius had been screaming in a high-pitched voice after discovering he had fatally shot Steenkamp. 
 
 At one point, Masipa said: ""I continue to explain why most witnesses got their facts wrong."" 
 
 Masipa also said she was disregarding text messages between Steenkamp and Pistorius that had been entered as evidence. Prosecutors had submitted text messages that showed tension between them while the defense submitted messages that indicated mutual affection. That evidence, the judge said, doesn't prove anything. 
 
 ""Normal relationships are dynamic and unpredictable most of the time, while human beings are fickle,"" she said. 
 
 Pistorius faced 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder for fatally shooting Steenkamp in his home in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 14, 2013. He also faces years in jail if found guilty of murder without pre-planning, or of negligent killing. Pistorius could also be acquitted if Masipa believes he made a tragic error. 
 
 Pistorius has said he mistakenly shot Steenkamp through the closed door of a toilet cubicle, thinking there was an intruder in his home and pleaded not guilty to murder. 
 
 A key part of the prosecution's case was its assertion that Steenkamp screamed during a late-night alleged fight with Pistorius before he killed her. But Masipa said some of those witnesses who testified to hearing a woman scream in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 14, 2013 were ""genuinely mistaken in what they heard, as the chronology will show."" 
 
 That appeared to indicate that the defense had succeeded in raising doubts that Steenkamp ever screamed. The defense says the screaming was instead Pistorius, who was traumatized and desperately calling for help in a high-pitched voice after realizing he had shot Steenkamp in error. 
 
 Masipa also cited testimony of an acoustics expert called by the defense, saying it cast ""serious doubt"" on whether witnesses who were hundreds of meters (yards) away in their homes — as some state witnesses were — could have differentiated between the screams of a man or a woman. 
 
 Earlier, Masipa began by outlining in detail the four charges against the Olympic runner: Murder, two counts of unlawfully firing a gun in a public place in unrelated incidents and one count of illegal possession of ammunition. 
 
 Before the session began, Pistorius hugged his brother Carl, who was seated in a wheelchair because of injuries suffered in a recent car crash. 
 
 The parents of Steenkamp were also in the packed gallery. Other members of Pistorius' family, including his father Henke, sat behind him. 
 
 If Pistorius is convicted on any charge, the case will likely be postponed until a later sentencing hearing. 
 
 There were many journalists at the courthouse, where the sensational trial has unfolded over the last six months. ||||| Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius did not commit murder the night he killed Reeva Steenkamp, a judge said Thursday. 
 
 He did not intend to kill her, Judge Thokozile Masipa said. 
 
 But his conduct was ""negligent,"" she said before adjourning for the day, suggesting she will find the Olympian guilty of culpable homicide. 
 
 There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law. It's up to the judge to decide. 
 
 As he fired four bullets into the bathroom of his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year, he did not foresee the ""possibility that he would kill the person behind the door, let alone the deceased, as he thought she was in the bedroom at the time,"" Masipa said. 
 
 Evidence suggests that Pistorius genuinely believed the person in the bathroom was an intruder, although that is irrelevant to the case, the judge said. 
 
 Pistorius could have taken other actions when he thought there was an intruder, she said. ""All the accused had to do was to pick up his cell phone to call security or the police,"" she said. 
 
 ""He could have run to the balcony and screamed in the same way he screamed after the incident,"" she added, noting that Pistorius called security after the incident and could have done so when he heard what he thought was an intruder. 
 
 Judge: Pistorius' background no excuse 
 
 Defense arguments that his upbringing ""in a crime-riddled environment and in a home where the mother was paranoid and always carried a firearm"" might explain his conduct that night, but ""it does not excuse the conduct,"" Masipa said. 
 
 ""The accused had reasonable time to reflect, to think and to conduct himself reasonably,"" she said. ""I am not persuaded that a reasonable person with the accused's disabilities in the same circumstances would have fired four shots into that small toilet cubicle."" 
 
 Following the country's legal standard for determining culpable homicide, Masipa found that ""a reasonable person"" would have ""foreseen the reasonable possibility"" that whoever was in the bathroom might have been killed, and would have ""taken steps to guard against that possibility,"" she said. 
 
 ""I am of the view that the accused acted too hastily and used excessive force,"" she said, adding that under the circumstances, ""it is clear that his conduct was negligent."" 
 
 Pistorius could be seen crying at times during the reading of the lengthy verdict. 
 
 The Olympian's trial in the death of his model and law graduate girlfriend started six months ago, transfixing the world with graphic details of how he fatally shot Steenkamp. 
 
 Before she rejected the premeditated murder charge, Masipa questioned why he fired ""not one ... but four shots"" into the bathroom before he went to find his girlfriend. 
 
 However, she said, the intention to shoot does not necessarily mean the intent to kill. 
 
 Judge: Pistorius knew right from wrong 
 
 ""Court is satisfied that at the relevant time, the accused could distinguish between right and wrong,"" and act accordingly, she said. 
 
 Masipa cast doubt on witness testimony and said she believes media coverage contaminated testimonies. She doubted state witnesses, saying they were in and out of sleep the night of the killing. 
 
 ""Technology is more reliable than human perception and human memory,"" she said. 
 
 She described the victim's wound as ""immediately incapacitating"" and said she believed a scream heard by witnesses the night of the killing was Pistorius,' not Steenkamp's. 
 
 The judge appeared to be accepting the defense timeline of events that the shots came first, then screaming that must have been Pistorius. 
 
 She knocked down some aspects of the state's case: the fact that Steenkamp took her phone and locked herself in the bathroom allegedly out of fear for her safety, phone messages between the couple that showed some rocky patches, and her stomach contents. 
 
 Barry and June Steenkamp sat expressionless a few rows behind the man on trial for killing their daughter. Her father bowed his head as he heard about his daughter's fatal wounds. 
 
 Pistorius' uncle, sister and brother also attended the hearing in the packed courtroom -- the latter in a wheelchair from a car accident. 
 
 Lesser charges 
 
 Pistorius also faces three weapons charges. 
 
 The most serious relates to ammunition found in his house when police searched it after the killing. He did not have a proper license for it, but he says he was storing it in his safe for his father. 
 
 If he is found guilty of the ammunition charge, he could face up to 15 years in prison, though the judge could opt for a lesser punishment such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. 
 
 Two other charges are related to allegations that he recklessly fired a gun in public -- once in a restaurant in 2012, and again out of the sunroof of a car last year. Pistorius denies both. 
 
 The maximum penalty for each charge is five years behind bars. If he is convicted of either, he could face a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license.

 The verdicts came after she ripped into the athlete - the first amputee to run in both the Olympics and Paralympics - over his evidence, describing him as a ""poor"" witness who was initially composed, then ""contradicted himself"" under cross examination. 
 
 Pistorius was charged with one count of murder, two of illegally discharging a firearm - which is unrelated to the death of Ms Steenkamp - and one of illegally possessing ammunition. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

At the game reserve, they stopped at a curio shop where Jon spotted a 15- to 18-inch giraffe bone with a herd of elephants carved on it. He was interested in the bone because he hadn't seen anything like it and thought it might look good on his desk at home. He's a retired dentist who's traveled to 132 countries on seven continents.""Is that legal,"" Jon said was the first thing he asked the shop clerk.The clerk said yes and told Grant all the laws have to do with ivory.""That sounded logical,"" he said. But he hadn't thought the bone might be illegal in another country.Later in the trip the couple flew from Kenya to Tanzania for a 6-day safari. On the way out of the country, a baggage checker asked Jon to remove the bone from his luggage. Jon told the checker what it was and where he bought it. The checker examined it while the couple's luggage was put on a plane.

Speier thinks they were targeted because they were Americans and they looked like they had money.Getting out of Tanzania cost the Grants $62,000, little of they will get back even though American officials intervened.

She said U.S. officials should reevaluate that aid or at least have a direct conversation about how local customs agents handle Americans being processed through their system. She said the problem faced by the Grants may be a pattern that has developed. If there is a pattern, U.S. officials need to reevaluate the U.S.'s relationship with Tanzania, according to Speier. Future travelers need to be alerted too, Speier said.Before the Grants were able to come home they had to pay $2,000 to have a person carry an original receipt from South Africa to a Tanzanian courtroom to prove where they bought the bone.""This is pretty egregious,"" Speier said. ||||| African safari turns into ‘trip from Hell' for Foster City couple News African Safari turns to ‘trip from hell’ for Foster City couple Jon and Linda Grant have traveled around the world, but the couple from Foster City is now back home after what can only be described as the trip from Hell.

 ""That was very, very scary. We were in with real criminals just lined up in the booking area,"" said Jon Grant. 
 
 
 
 ""You're just so exhausted so tired you just go where they tell you to go,"" added Linda. 
 
 
 
 Jon Grant, a 72-year-old retired dentist and his wife would end up paying thousands of dollars he' says to bribe a judge and other officials to get the charges reduced and to get a earlier court hearing. 
 
 
 
 Grant was also able to contact a Foster City councilmember who called Peninsula Congresswoman Jackie Speier. 
 
 
 
 Speier then contacted the ambassador in Tanzania and got the charges reduced to failing to have an export permit. That carries a $30,000 fine. 
 
 
 
 ""They said, ‘Are you willing to pay it?’ We said, ‘absolutely’. Cost us $30,000 for buying souvenir plus another $30,000 in bribes to get out of the country,"" said Jon Grant. 
 
 
 
 Speier told us by phone she intends to have a serious talk with the Tanzanian ambassador to discuss this case and corruption, in the hopes other Americans are not targeted. 
 
 
 
 ""It is a nightmare and there have been nightmares since we got home from it,"" said Linda. 
 
 
 
 The Grants say they have no plans to travel outside the U.S. anytime soon. 
 
","– A California couple on safari in Africa bought a souvenir that ended up being far more expensive than they could have imagined. Jon and Linda Grant picked up the souvenir, a 15- to 18-inch giraffe bone onto which a herd of elephants had been carved, at a game reserve in South Africa after being assured by the clerk that it was perfectly legal. That may have been the case in South Africa, but the Grants ran into trouble when the safari took them to Tanzania. They were jailed after being informed at the airport that the giraffe was Tanzania's national animal, reports ABC7. Anti-poaching officials were called to the scene, and the Grants were suddenly facing a 20-year sentence and a $150,000 fine. Eventually, the charges were reduced to failure to have an export permit, which carries a still-hefty $30,000 fine. ""They said, 'Are you willing to pay it?'"" Jon Grant, a 72-year-old retired dentist, tells KTVU. ""We said, 'Absolutely.' Cost us $30,000 for buying [the] souvenir plus another $30,000 in bribes to get out of the country."" Local Congresswoman Jackie Speier, who helped get the original charges reduced, thinks this was likely more than a mix-up—that the Grants were targeted as wealthy Americans. ""This is pretty egregious,"" she tells ABC7, adding that US officials should be on the lookout for a pattern and that American tourists should be on alert.

 With four-fifths of precincts reporting, Schweikert was leading Quayle, 53 percent to 47 percent and The Associated Press called the race. Redistricting thrust the two incumbents into battle for a Scottsdale-area seat.

 (PHOTOS: Ben Quayle’s life and career) 
 
 Schweikert attacked Quayle mercilessly throughout the primary, telling voters he owes his position in Congress to his father’s name and connections. And Quayle’s past life gave Schweikert no shortage of other ammunition: Quayle was forced years ago to admit writing under a pseudonym for TheDirty.com, a racy site about Scottsdale nightlife, and had to contend with a picture that emerged of him partying in a cow costume. 
 
 A story by POLITICO last week reinforced that image: Quayle was among several lawmakers who went swimming in the holy Sea of Galilee — including one in the buff — after a night of drinking. Though Quayle insisted he had only a glass of wine and joined in for the religious experience, the scandal raised fresh questions about the lawmaker’s maturity.

 In another key race, Rep. Jeff Flake dispatched real estate investor Wil Cardon in the state’s Republican Senate primary. A six-term congressman, Flake drew support from establishment and tea party types, leaving little room for Cardon, who poured millions of his personal fortune into his campaign. Flake will face off against Democratic former U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona, in November — a race that’s expected to be competitive but is generally thought to favor Republicans. 
 
 Another freshman GOP member of the Arizona House delegation, Rep. Paul Gosar, easily survived a challenge by outspoken state Sen. Ron Gould, who had the backing of the Club for Growth. Gosar outraised Gould by a wide margin, but the Club narrowed that advantage by spending more than $600,000 Gould’s behalf. 
 
 (Also on POLITICO: Arizona House primary results) 
 
 And in the race for Flake’s House seat, former Republican Rep. Matt Salmon was leading former Arizona House Speaker Kirk Adams, 54 percent to 46 percent, with four-fifths of precincts reporting. Adams was endorsed by Sarah Palin. 
 
 But the must-watch race of the night was Quayle vs. Schweikert. Both men boasted conservative voting records and ideologies, so the contest came down to character. 
 
 (Also on POLITICO: 'Fortunate son' rap threatens Quayle) 
 
 Quayle argued that the 50-year-old Schweikert would say anything to win. Quayle created a website, DishonestDave.com, in an attempt to catalogue what Quayle called a series of lies and distortions. 
 
 In a recent interview, Quayle told POLITICO that he knew his last name “would put a big target on my back” if he ran for office. So when he arrived in Congress in 2011, Quayle took cues from the Hillary Clinton model, taking on weighty committee assignments, boning up on the issues and, for the most part, keeping his head down. 
 
 But redistricting threw a huge monkey wrench in that strategy. Pitted against an opponent whose intensity on the campaign trail bordered on obsessive — and who showed no compunction about revisiting the old knocks against Quayle as an undisciplined partier — Quayle found himself on the defensive for much of the race. 
 
 Schweikert, for his part, tried to draw a sharp personal contrast with Quayle, emphasizing working-class aspects of his biography such as how he washed dishes to help pay for college. Though Quayle represented about two-thirds of the redrawn district, Schweikert was a well-known figure in his own right, thanks to decades of work in state and local politics. 
 
 In other primaries Tuesday, Democratic Rep. Ron Barber, the former aide to Gabrielle Giffords who won a June special election, easily beat back a challenge by state legislator Matt Heinz. Barber faces a competitive November race against Republican Martha McSally, a retired Air Force officer. 
 
 In Oklahoma, meanwhile, both parties selected nominees in the race for the seat of retiring Democratic Rep. Dan Boren of Oklahoma. Plumbing company owner Markwayne Mullin defeated George Faught in the Republican runoff. On the Democratic side, former prosecutor Rob Wallace beat seed company owner Wayne Herriman. 
 
 Republicans are expected to seize the GOP-leaning seat in November. ||||| Rep. Jeff Flake won Arizona’s Republican Senate primary Tuesday, easily defeating self-funded businessman Wil Cardon. He will face former surgeon general Richard Carmona in the general election. 
 
 In other important races held Tuesday, Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) defeated fellow freshman Republican Rep. Ben Quayle while Republican Rep. Paul Gosar turned back a challenge from Ron Gould, a state legislator backed by the Washington based anti-tax group Club For Growth. 
 
 Arizona gained an additional House seat following the decennial redistricting process. The new lines also prompted some reshuffling among the state’s current delegation. Quayle was faced with a choice: run in the swing 9th district or the more Republican 6thdistrict. He chose the latter last winter, setting off a fierce competition with Schweikert. 
 
 Flake’s win is a victory for the Republican establishment, which viewed him as the candidate most capable of holding the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. John Kyl (R). 
 
 Cardon’s personal money allowed him to run ads that raised his name recognition and made him competitive against the congressman, who has burnished a reputation as a fiscal conservative. But Flake also spent big – over $4 million, none of which came from his own pockets – and eventually put significant distance between himself and Cardon. 
 
 Flake will now face Carmona, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Carmona served as surgeon general during the administration of George W. Bush and was recruited by President Obama to join the race. Democrats are hopeful his moderate political profile will help him stay competitive, even in a state that leans Republican. 
 
 Elsewhere on Tuesday, in Oklahoma’s 2nd district, where Democratic Rep. Dan Boren is retiring, plumbing company owner Markwayne Mullin won the Republican runoff and will begin the general election as the frontrunner in a district that gave Sen. John McCain two out of every three votes in 2008. Mullin’s Democratic opponent will be Rob Wallace, a prosecutor.

246,"Anne Smedinghoff, 25, was killed Saturday, April 6, 2013, in southern Afghanistan, the first American diplomat to die on the job since last year's attack on the U.S. diplomatic installation in Benghazi, Libya. (AP Photo/Courtesy of Tom Smedinghoff) (Uncredited/AP) 
 
 Three American civilians and three U.S. troops were killed in two attacks in Afghanistan on Saturday, officials said, including a powerful blast that struck officials traveling to a school to donate books. Among the dead was the first State Department diplomat to be killed in the country since the war began. 
 
 The bloodshed Saturday, the deadliest day this year for Americans in Afghanistan, underscored how dangerous the country remains as the United States proceeds with the withdrawal of its remaining troops over the next 20 months, leaving security in the hands of Afghanistan’s fledgling army. 
 
 The attacks suggested that even as the military coalition’s focus shifts to managing the drawdown, the United States appears likely to face an intense “fighting season,” the springtime period in Afghanistan during which violence typically in­creases. 
 
 The American diplomat killed Saturday was identified as Anne Smedinghoff by her parents. Smedinghoff was recently tasked with assisting Secretary of State John F. Kerry on his trip to Kabul. 
 
 Four other State Department officials who were with her, traveling to a school in the southern province of Zabul, were injured in the same bombing, one critically, Kerry said in a statement. 
 
 “She was everything a Foreign Service Officer should be: smart, capable, eager to serve, and deeply committed to our country and the difference she was making for the Afghan people,” Kerry said. “She tragically gave her young life working to give young Afghans the opportunity to have a better future.” 
 
 In a somber address to State Department employees in Istanbul, Kerry paid tribute to Smedinghoff. 
 
 There is no greater contradiction, Kerry said, between Smedinghoff's zeal to ""change the world"" and help others and a bomber who he said drove a car into their vehicle. 
 
 ""Folks who want to kill people, and that's all they want to do, are scared of knowledge. They want to shut the doors,"" Kerry said. 
 
 ""Here is a huge challenge for us. Here's a confrontation with modernity, with possibilities, with everything that our country stands for."" 
 
 Smedinghoff, 25, served as Kerry’s main embassy guide and aide during his two-day visit late last month. That assignment, as a “control officer,” is considered an honor and a mark of promise for young Foreign Service officers. 
 
 The diplomat began an assignment as a press officer in Kabul last summer after spending two years at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, where she worked in the consular section. Smedinghoff graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a degree in international relations, said her parents, Tom and Mary Beth Smedinghoff. 
 
 The Smedinghoffs, who live in the Chicago area, said in an e-mail that their daughter joined the State Department straight out of college. 
 
 “She particularly enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with the Afghan people and was always looking for opportunities to reach out and help to make a difference in the lives of those living in a country ravaged by war,” they said. “We are consoled knowing that she was doing what she loved, and that she was serving her country by helping to make a positive difference in the world.” 
 
 The attacks came as Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived in Afghanistan to take stock of the war as U.S. officials continue to deliberate how quickly they should pull out the 68,000 American troops still deployed there. 
 
 Saturday’s violence followed a coordinated attack Wednesday in the country’s relatively safe west that killed at least 46 people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault in Farah province, saying it had been carried out to avenge the group’s fighters who have been “kept in prisons for years on end and even mercilessly given the death penalty.” 
 
 In the deadlier of the two attacks Saturday, in Zabul province’s Qalat district, insurgents detonated a bomb when a convoy transporting U.S. troops and State Department officials and another one carrying the governor of the province intersected. The blast, in an area that has long been a Taliban stronghold, killed three U.S. service members, the young diplomat and a U.S. Defense Department employee. 
 
 The Associated Press reported that the governor survived the attack but that an Afghan doctor was killed in the explosion. 
 
 In a statement, the Taliban said the attack was carried out at noon when a militant detonated explosives packed in a vehicle as the provincial governor was approaching the Americans. A Taliban spokesman told the AP that militants linked to the group were hoping to strike a U.S. or an Afghan government convoy when they placed the bomb. “We were waiting for one of them,” spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said. “It was our good luck that both appeared at the same time.” 
 
 In the east, meanwhile, a third American civilian was killed in an “insurgent attack,” according to a statement issued by the military coalition in Kabul. It offered no further details. 
 
 Dempsey, the country’s top U.S. military official, told reporters traveling with him that he was heartened by what U.S. officials have described as spontaneous rebellions against the Taliban that have unfolded in recent months as the U.S. presence in the country has thinned. He expressed hope that a political solution will lead at least some segments of the Taliban to join the political process, according to remarks published by the American Forces Press Service, a Pentagon news division. 
 
 “Any conflict in history, when it is resolved, is resolved through some form of reconciliation,” Dempsey said. “I support the effort to try . . . through the Afghans to encourage them to take reconciliation as an important line of effort.” 
 
 Kerry, who traveled Saturday to the Middle East, spoke to the woman’s parents to offer “what little comfort I can for their immeasurable loss.” 
 
 “As the father of two daughters, I can’t imagine what their family is feeling today,” he said. 
 
 Tom Smedinghoff said his daughter died in the pursuit of a career she loved. 
 
 “The world lost a truly beautiful soul today,” he said. “She was such a wonderful woman--strong, intelligent, independent, and loving.”

 Anne Smedinghoff, a 25-year-old foreign service officer, died Saturday when the group she was traveling with was struck by an explosion in southern Zabul province. They were traveling to donate textbooks to students. An employee with the U.S. State Department and three U.S. soldiers were also killed in the attack. 
 
 The Chicago-area woman is the first American diplomat to die on the job since last year's attack on the U.S. diplomatic installation in Benghazi, Libya.

 Smedinghoff was ""vivacious, smart, capable, chosen often by the ambassador there to be the lead person because of her capabilities,"" Kerry said. 
 
 The attack killed Afghan civilians and wounded four more State Department personnel. One of them was in critical condition in a hospital in Kandahar, Kerry told reporters Sunday.

 ""One of the things I'm going to ask (Dunford) is ... what have you learned,"" Dempsey told the American Forces Press Service. 
 
 ""If he tells me 'Nothing,' I'm going to say, 'Maybe we got the wrong guy.'""

 Scientists with the Victoria (B.C.) Marine Science Association say a necropsy found that the whale found dead on Vancouver Island was pregnant with a full-term fetus, which may have caused the whale's death. 
 
 The 18-year-old orca J-32, nicknamed Rhapsody, was found dead on Thursday. 
 
 The VMSA said via Facebook on Sunday that the current theory on the cause of death is that the calf may have died first, resulting in an infection, which contributed to or caused Rhapsody's death. Lab results are pending. 
 
 The orca's head will be sent to a lab in the United States for MRI testing to determine if there was any acoustic damage, though that is not suspected. 
 
 The Victoria Marine Science Association said the necropsy began with a sage smudging ceremony by a local Indigenous man. 
 
 ""It was a very moving and powerful way to send Rhapsody on to rest and thank her for the information she and her calf have provided to science,"" the Association said. 
 
 CTV reported Sunday that an investigation is underway after it was discovered that four of the whale's teeth had been sawed off and stolen. 
 
 The death marks a major blow for a population already struggling with low birth and survival rates. The total population is now 77. 
 
 Earlier this fall an orca calf was presumed dead seven weeks after its birth. It's been three years since the J, K or L pod produced a baby that survived more than a year.

 The endangered orca, known as J-32, was reported floating in the water near Courtenay on Thursday. The area is located on the eastern side of Vancouver Island more than 200 kilometres northwest of Victoria. 
 
 Officials with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans moved the carcass to a boat launch Friday evening, where it was set to undergo a post-mortem examination on Saturday. 
 
 By morning, several teeth were damaged or removed, said Paul Cottrell, the Pacific marine mammals co-ordinator for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
 
 ""Her jaw and teeth were in great shape and solid,"" Cottrell said in an interview Sunday. 
 
 'Cut off right to the gum' 
 
 ""It looks like they broke off a couple, and there were a number that were sawed off, and those were cut off right to the gum."" 
 
 Cottrell said fisheries officers are following up on a number of leads. 
 
 He said the department doesn't know what motivated the theft, such as whether it might be linked to the sale or trade of endangered species. 
 
 The federal Species At Risk act makes it illegal to possess part of an endangered or threatened animal. 
 
 The law carries a range of sentences depending on whether the perpetrator is a corporation, non-profit group or a private citizen. For individuals, the maximum penalty is a fine of $250,000, up to five years in prison or both, though maximum sentences are rarely imposed.

 ""It's just a senseless, illegal act,"" said Cottrell. ""We take this kind of thing seriously. We don't want endangered species parts being traded or sold."" 
 
 Biologists who have been examining the whale have yet to determine a cause of death. 
 
 The necropsy revealed the whale was pregnant with a full-term fetus. 
 
 Marcie Callewaert of the Victoria Marine Science Association, a fledging group that she hopes to turn into a non-profit soon, said she went to the area to see the whale on Saturday. 
 
 Callewaert said it's significant any time an orca dies, and she said the missing teeth just makes it worse. 
 
 ""I set eyes on her on the beach about the same time a lady told me that her teeth had been cut the night before, so that was two blows at once,"" said Callewaert, a Grade 6 teacher who spends her summers as a whale-watching photographer. 
 
 Tissue samples from the orca and the fetus will be examined at a number of labs across North America, said Cottrell of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Results are expected in four to six weeks. 
 
 The skeletons will be donated to the Royal B.C. Museum. 
 
 Significant blow to killer whale population 
 
 The death of the orca is considered a significant blow to the killer whale population and efforts to rebuild it. 
 
 J-32 was a southern resident orca. Until the animal's death, there were believed to be 78 southern residents in the wild. Of those, 17 to 18 were believed to be reproductive females. 
 
 The whale that was found dead on Thursday , J-32, had been carrying a full-term fetus, the necropsy team reported. (Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research) 
 
 ""When you have 78 animals and you lose an animal that is just going into breeding age — a female that has the potential to contribute for decades — that's a huge loss to this population,"" said Cottrell. 
 
 ""Just the fact that she was so close to giving birth, it's unfortunate, because that calf, if it had lived, would be significant to the population."" 
 
 Cottrell credited the Marine Mammal Response Program, a network of volunteers along the coast who report injured or dead animals, for alerting the department to the orca so quickly, allowing biologists to retrieve a ""pristine"" specimen for examination. 
 
 ""If we didn't have the program, we wouldn't have been able to secure and get this animal and be able to necropsy such a fresh animal,"" he said. ||||| In this photo taken on Nov. 29, 2014, provided by San Juan Orcas, Puget Sound orcas known as the J-pod swim together in Spieden Channel, north of San Juan Island.

 COURTENAY, British Columbia (AP) — The necropsy on the endangered orca found dead off Vancouver Island showed it was pregnant with a full-term fetus, and that someone removed several teeth from the dead killer whale before it could be examined. 
 
 Experts had speculated the death may have arisen from birth complications. Biologists have yet to determine the cause of death. 
 
 The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans also said someone removed several teeth. 
 
 ""It looks like they broke off a couple, and there were a number that were sawed off, and those were cut off right to the gum,"" said Paul Cottrell, the agency's Pacific marine mammals coordinator. 
 
 It's illegal to possess part of an endangered animal. 
 
 ""It's just a senseless, illegal act,"" Cottrell said. ""We take this kind of thing seriously. We don't want endangered species parts being traded or sold."" 
 
 The orca known as J-32 was found floating in the water Thursday near Courtenay. It was moved to a boat launch Friday for the necropsy, which took place Saturday. 
 
 The death leaves 77 animals in the Puget Sound orca population, which was listed as endangered in 2005. 
 
 ""The fetus was decomposing,"" said Ken Balcomb, a scientist with the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, assisted in the necropsy. ""The tests will be able to tell whether the fetus was already dead before the mother died, and therefore may have been the cause of her death."" 
 
 Tissue samples from the orca and the fetus will be examined at a number of labs across North America, Cottrell said. Results are expected in four to six weeks. 
 
 ""Hopefully there will be enough evidence in tissue and fetus to understand what's going wrong,"" Balcomb said. 
 
 He said he does not think it's a natural birthing issue because ""we know that the levels of toxins that are in these whales are harmful to reproductive status."" 
 
 There hasn't been a successful birth in the population for 2 ½ years, Balcomb said. 
 
 The orca looked healthy but its blubber level was thinner than usual, indicating that it had poor nutrition for some time, Balcomb said. 
 
 ""What we do know is that if we could provide a food supply that's abundant and healthy, they wouldn't have to rely on their blubber storage for energy,"" he said. ||||| ... 
 
 ent killer whales, researchers confirmed. The calf was born to L77, said Ken Balcomb, founding director of the Center for Whale Research. He confirmed the birth in a text to The Seattle Times Friday. He estimated the calf is several weeks old. 
 
 A new calf has been born to the critically endangered southern resid","– That an endangered orca was found dead on the eastern side of Vancouver Island Thursday was itself gloomy news: Named J-32 and nicknamed Rhapsody, it was part of a population that had only 78 members, and thought to be one of only 18 able to reproduce. But the completed necropsy dealt two additional blows: First, the orca was pregnant. ""When you have 78 animals and you lose an animal ... that has the potential to contribute for decades—that's a huge loss to this population,"" says Paul Cottrell of the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The fetus was full term, and while results from tests to be performed on tissue samples won't be available for at least a month, KING 5 News reports the leading theory is that the calf may have actually spurred the mother's death. The theory posted to Facebook last night by the Victoria Marine Science Association: that the calf died and caused an infection that ultimately killed, or had a hand in the death of, its mother. KING 5 News notes that a calf birthed by an orca in the J, K, or L pod hasn't survived longer than a year in the last three years. The second blow: Between Friday evening, when the carcass was placed on a boat launch, and Saturday morning, in advance of the scheduled necropsy, a number of its teeth were removed, some sawed off ""right to the gum,"" Cottrell tells the Canadian Press. He notes that Rhapsody's jaw and teeth were otherwise ""in great shape and solid."" The department is investigating. The Puget Sound orca population was listed as endangered in 2005, notes the AP.

248,"A 15-year-old is speaking out against an insurance company after she was denied coverage for a minimally invasive surgery that would have saved her from a lifetime of seizures. 
 
 Cara Pressman, from New York, suffers through nightmarish epileptic episodes several times a week, helplessly shaking and unable to communicate for up to two minutes. 
 
 Her doctors recommended a laser ablation to remove lesions in her brain that are causing her epilepsy, but the family’s insurance provider Aetna told Cara’s parents, Julianne and Robert, of New York, that the surgery was still ‘experimental.’ 
 
 ‘Considering they’re denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that’s wrong with my brain, I would probably just say, “Screw you,”‘ Cara told CNN. 
 
 The alternative to laser ablation is a major open brain operation that would require surgeons to crack open Cara’s skull and cut out a portion of her temporal lobe. 
 
 About three million people in the US suffer of epilepsy of some form. The disease’s name describes a range of seizure disorders of varying severity, but about one third of people with the disorder are debilitated by uncontrollable, untreatable seizures. 
 
 Cara is one of those million people, or at least she thought she would be until her doctors scheduled her for a laser ablation surgery in New York on October 23. 
 
 Cara’s form of epilepsy, her doctors believe, is caused by areas of damaged tissue in her brain. The areas, called lesions, may have developed on their own, or as a result of trauma or tumors. 
 
 Removing them could well free Cara from her terrifying bouts of cold, shaking seizures. 
 
 But just three days before her operation was to take place, her parents, Julianne and Robert got a letter from the family’s insurance company, Aetna. 
 
 The company refused to cover Cara’s operation, a devastating blow to the hopeful teen and her family. 
 
 Instead of removing a larger portion of her skull and cutting away brain matter in the procedure the company would cover, a laser ablation would have allowed surgeons to drill a small hole in to Cara’s head, and finely target the lesions with a laser to remove them. 
 
 Aetna, considers the ablation procedure ‘experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established,’ according to its website. 
 
 ‘It is never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved,’ Aetna said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. ‘However, effectiveness and member safety will always be the most important factors in determining our clinical policies.’ 
 
 The company said that it had conducted an ‘extensive review,’ and that the approved lobectomy ‘is supported by a larger body of evidence.’ 
 
 The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first system for laser ablation in the brain in 2010. 
 
 Results of studies of the laser surgery are mixed, but promising. Some studies have shown that it is 75 percent effective at treating seizure disorders that don’t respond to medications, like Cara’s. 
 
 The so-called ‘golden standard’ for medical trials involves randomly assigning half of the participants to have the new procedure, and half to get a placebo procedure, in order to test its effectiveness without bias. 
 
 So far, none of the completed trials for laser ablation have been done by this method, though one is in progress through May Clinic. 
 
 But The Epilepsy Foundation’s chief scientist, Dr Jaqueline French says that ‘most surgical techniques, even common ones, have not been subjected to standard placebo-controlled trials, as [surgical trials]are much more complex for a number of reasons.’ 
 
 On the other hand, temporal lobectomies provide good results for about 85 percent of patients, while between 10 and 15 percent have little to no improvement. 
 
 The results are good, and the incidence of complications is low, but if something does go wrong, a patient’s peripheral vision, speech and language capabilities could be impaired. 
 
 Phil Gattone, CEO of The Epilepsy Foundation said in a statement: ‘As a parent with a very young child, it was extremely challenging for our family to make a decision to remove part of our child’s skull and brain for a surgery that we hoped would end the devastation of seizures that were stopping his development,’ he said. 
 
 Ultimately, his son’s surgery was a success, but Gattone added that the foundation has seen that epilepsy patients and their families ‘are facing more barriers to physician-directed care.’ 
 
 Dr French says that, compared to laser ablation, a lobectomy can come at ‘a substantially higher monetary and personal cost.’ ||||| The author of the story has a family member with an uncontrolled seizure disorder who does not medically qualify for either type of brain surgery mentioned in the piece nor has the family member been denied care by an insurance provider. 
 
 (CNN) Cara Pressman sobbed in the big red chair in her living room. The 15-year-old tried to absorb the devastating news relayed by her parents: that their insurance company, Aetna, denied her for a minimally invasive brain surgery that could end the seizures that have haunted her since she was 9 years old. 
 
 ""When my parents told me, I went kind of blank and started crying,"" she said. ""I cried for like an hour."" 
 
 Her friends had been lined up to visit her in the hospital for the surgery three days away, on Monday, October 23. Between tears, she texted them that the whole thing was off. 
 
 It was supposed to be a joyous weekend. Cara's grandparents had come to town to celebrate their 90th birthdays, a jubilant party with more than 100 family and friends crowding her home. The party did go on -- just with a lot more stress. 
 
 Cara had multiple complex partial seizures that weekend. When the seizures strike, her body gets cold and shakes, and she zones out for anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes, typically still aware of her surroundings. Her seizures can be triggered by stress, by being happy, by exerting herself -- almost anything. ""It's like having a nightmare but while you're awake,"" she said. 
 
 In the six weeks since the denial, Cara has had more than two dozen seizures affecting her everyday life. Her message to Aetna is blunt: ""Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain, I would probably just say, 'Screw you.' '' 
 
 Aetna: We're looking out for what's best for patients 
 
 The Pressman family and, separately, Jennifer Rittereiser, a 44-year-old mom who has struggled with seizures since she was 10, approached CNN in recent weeks after they were both denied, by Aetna, for laser ablation surgery, a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures are originating. Aetna is the third-largest health insurance provider in the country, providing medical coverage to 23.1 million people. 
 
 Neurologists consider laser ablation, which is performed through a small hole in the skull, to be safer and more precise than traditional brain surgery, where the top portion of the skull is removed in order for doctors to operate. The procedure is less daunting for the patient and parents who make decisions for their children: No one likes the idea of a skull opened and a chunk of brain removed. 
 
 In denying Cara her surgery, Aetna said it considers laser ablation surgery ""experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established."" 
 
 ""Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures effective for treatment of the member's condition,"" Aetna wrote in its rejection letter. 
 
 The insurance company did approve her for the more invasive and more expensive open brain surgery, called a temporal lobectomy, even though her medical team never sought approval for the procedure. 
 
 The laser surgery is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is widely recognized within the epilepsy community as an effective treatment alternative to open brain surgery, especially when the location of seizure activity can be pinpointed to a specific part of the brain. 
 
 Dr. Jamie Van Gompel, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic, disputes Aetna's assessment. He is not involved in Cara's care nor Rittereiser's treatment, but he said Aetna's assessment is wrong. 
 
 ""I would not call it experimental at all,"" said Van Gompel, who is leading a clinical trial on the surgery at Mayo as part of a larger national study. ""It's definitely not an experimental procedure. There've been thousands of patients treated with it. It's FDA-approved. There's a lot of data out there to suggest it's effective for epilepsy."" 
 
 Van Gompel said a temporal lobectomy carries a much higher risk of serious complications, including the possibility of death. ""It's a big jump to go to a big invasive procedure,"" he said. 
 
 Recovery time after open brain surgery can range from six to 12 weeks. By contrast, a patient who undergoes laser ablation can be back to work or at school in less than two weeks. The pain from laser surgery is much less, and extreme headaches are fewer than with open brain surgery, Van Gompel said. 
 
 While laser ablation has not yet undergone large randomized controlled trials, Van Gompel said existing data shows it's effective more than 50% of the time. He hopes the current clinical trial will show a success rate of 60% to 70% or better in epilepsy patients. Temporal lobectomies, he said, have a slightly better rate, of more than 70%. 
 
 Pressed by CNN for a better explanation on its denial, Aetna stood by its rejection for Cara and Rittereiser, saying it was in the best interest of the patients. But the language was softened slightly. 
 
 Cara Pressman was 9 when her seizures started. She's had them in the classroom, on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays. 
 
 ""Clinical effectiveness and our members' safety are the primary criteria we use in determining whether a treatment or service is medically necessary,"" Aetna said. ""There is currently a limited amount of evidence-based, clinical studies related to laser ablation surgery. As noted by the Epilepsy Foundation, only studies with a very small number of participants have been used to report the effectiveness of this procedure. We consistently evaluate any new studies or additional evidence when developing our clinical policy bulletins, and will continue to do so for this procedure."" 
 
 Contacted for reaction, the Epilepsy Foundation strongly objected to Aetna's remarks, saying the insurance company took its information out of context. Laser ablation surgery ""has emerged as a new minimally invasive surgical option that is best suited for patients with symptomatic localization-related epilepsy,"" said Dr. Jacqueline French, the chief science officer with the Epilepsy Foundation. 
 
 ""This technology is much less invasive than the alternative, which involves removing a sizeable piece of brain, at a substantially higher monetary and personal cost,"" French said. ""This path should be available, if the treating epilepsy physician has recommended it, without delay or barriers."" 
 
 Phil Gattone, the president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation, said insurance denials and other barriers to treatment have become a common battle for thousands of Americans with seizure disorders. 
 
 Jennifer Rittereiser, 44, was denied laser ablation surgery. She was hoping the surgery would stop her seizures so she could spend more quality time with her sons. 
 
 Gattone knows first-hand the pain of what Cara's parents are going through. His own son began having seizures when he was 4 and underwent brain surgery in the early 1990s. ""It was extremely challenging for our family to make a decision to remove part of our child's skull and brain for a surgery that we hoped would end the devastation of seizures that were stopping his development,"" Gattone said. ""We took this leap of faith and made the decision, and it worked out the best for him."" 
 
 But he added that he and his wife wished laser ablation surgery had been available back then. The device used for laser ablation surgery was approved by the FDA nine years ago. ""I know that my wife and I would've found much more comfort if we had had (laser ablation) as an option,"" he said. 
 
 Gattone said people with seizures, their caregivers and their doctors should not be ""spending critical time in the midst of a health-care crisis, filing paperwork, making appeals or otherwise going through the motions of administrative paperwork"" trying to get approval for a life-changing operation. 
 
 ""The Epilepsy Foundation can understand no reason why an insurance company would place any barrier to delay a treatment that may save an individual's life, promote the development of the young child's brain or bring about seizure control,"" Gattone said. 
 
 Mom who crashed with kid in car gets denied 
 
 Jennifer Rittereiser lost consciousness behind the wheel of her silver SUV while driving with her 7-year-old son, Robert, in April. Her SUV rammed into a car in front of her and struck it again before veering into oncoming traffic. Her vehicle careened down an embankment, flipped over and came to rest on its side amid a tangle of brush. She narrowly missed slamming into a guardrail and several trees. 
 
 Mom and son somehow managed to walk free unharmed. 
 
 Jennifer Rittereiser's SUV plunged into an embankment after she had a seizure while driving in April. 
 
 ""People were amazed,"" she said. ""They had a helicopter on the way, actually. I am extremely fortunate just from that sense."" 
 
 Rittereiser has battled seizures since she was 10 and has been able to function with an array of medications in the three decades since. For much of her life, she could tell when the seizures might come. 
 
 These weren't like the seizures depicted in Hollywood movies; she wouldn't fall to the ground and writhe. She would zone out for a spell. She could understand people and could still function but couldn't speak back -- or if she did, her words were garbled. 
 
 As an executive in the health care industry, Rittereiser has fallen asleep during meetings. When she senses a seizure coming, she rushes to the bathroom to hide until they go away. One time, she says she urinated on herself at her desk without realizing it. 
 
 Rittereiser had a crash in 2014 in which she rear-ended a car after she had a seizure. No one was hurt in that crash, but she stopped driving for more than a year. Her medications were tweaked, and her seizures were largely kept in check, until the crash this April. 
 
 She was soon evaluated by an array of doctors and recommended for laser ablation surgery. After 34 years of struggling with seizures, she thought her ordeal might finally come to an end. Surgery was set for June 16. 
 
 But in late May, Aetna denied the surgery. She fought Aetna's decision through a lengthy appeals process. Aetna refused to budge. 
 
 ""It's just not right,"" Rittereiser said. 
 
 She said she recently went to Aetna's website to look up the company's values. She felt nauseated. ""Everything in their core values is not being shown in the way I'm being treated. They're talking about promoting wellness and health and 'being by your side.' "" 
 
 She paused, contemplating the company's ""by your side"" catchphrase, saying it's ""the most ridiculous thing, because they are the biggest barrier to my success and my well-being going forward. 
 
 ""It drives me crazy."" 
 
 Dad: 'You get so angry' 
 
 Julie Pressman stood near an elevator at her doctor's office when word came that Cara's surgery had been denied. The mom fell to the floor and wept. 
 
 She called Cara's father, Robert. He was at the airport picking up his 90-year-old parents for their birthday party. Mom and Dad rallied for their daughter and gathered strength to break the news. That's when Cara sat in the red chair, crying inconsolably. 
 
 Julie Pressman says she will never give up the fight for her daughter. 
 
 ""Telling Cara was horrible,"" her mom said. ""Horrible."" 
 
 ""It's just so frustrating for us to know there's a solution out there -- a way to fix our daughter -- and some bureaucratic machine is preventing this from happening,"" Robert Pressman said. ""You get so angry, but you don't know who to take it out on, because there's no particular person that's doing it. It's this big bureaucracy that's preventing this from happening."" 
 
 Julie and Robert said the most beautiful day of their lives came on August 20, 2002, when Cara popped into the world and met her 2-year-old sister, Lindsey, for the first time. ""That was the day we became a family,"" Julie said. ""Our love for those girls is amazing. How we got this lucky is beyond us."" 
 
 But that luck has been tested. When Cara was 9, she'd complained of extreme headaches for much of the day one evening, and then in the middle of the night, she began seizing uncontrollably. The family had two black Labradors that had gone to her room and barked like crazy to alert her parents. Cara had bitten her tongue, and blood was running down her face when they got to the room. 
 
 It was a terrifying scene. She was rushed off in an ambulance and underwent a battery of tests. Mom, Dad and Cara never thought they'd still be battling seizures six years later -- let alone an insurance company. She's had seizures on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays, in the classroom. Almost everywhere. 
 
 How does she envision a life without seizures? 
 
 ""I don't know,"" she said. ""I've never had a life without seizures."" 
 
 ""You will. You will,"" her dad told her. 
 
 ""I just don't know when,"" she responded. 
 
 Mom: ""It will happen, kiddo."" 
 
 Her mother calls Cara a feisty, petite powerhouse with big marble eyes and long eyelashes and a funny wit to match. She's a naturally gifted athlete, singer and dancer, but her parents feel that her seizures have kept her from reaching her full potential.

 They long for the day when the seizures are gone. The parents said they have paid $24,000 for insurance with Aetna this year. They're determined to get Cara laser ablation surgery with or without the insurance company's help. They will appeal Aetna's latest rejection -- but they're not optimistic. 
 
 In preparation, they've begun exploring raiding their retirement funds to pay the $300,000 out of pocket. ""Cara is worth every penny, but man,"" her mom said.

But just days before the procedure, it was canceled, because Aetna, the family's insurance company, denied the coverage, saying the surgery is ""experimental"" for epilepsy and ""the effectiveness of this approach has not been established."" Instead, Aetna approved a more expensive temporal lobectomy, despite laser ablation being FDA approved and a Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon saying the procedure is a well-regarded one.

Plus, patients who have laser ablation recover more quickly than those who undergo traditional brain surgery—in less than two weeks, instead of up to three months—and have less pain and less risk of complications, per Van Gompel.

Her parents say while they're appealing, they'll consider dipping into their retirement funds and finding other means to pay for the $300,000 out-of-pocket cost.

249,"Artist Jonathon Keats, holding one of his personal cameras, stands next to his copper pinhole camera that will take a photo over the course of a 1,000 years at Arizona State University Art Museum in Tempe on Thursday, March 5, 2015. (Photo: Michael Schennum / The Republic) Story Highlights Experimental philosopher Jonathon Keats is bringing his newest project to Tempe. 
 
 Keats is installing a ""millennium camera"" designed to take a 1,000-year photo of the skyline. 
 
 The public is invited to join the project by creating and placing 100-year cameras around the city. 
 
 If a camera had been placed in Tempe 1,000 years ago, its lens may have captured the rise and fall of Native American societies, the appearance of Charles Hayden's flour mill along the Salt River and the rapid urban development now shaping the city's skyline. 
 
 So what will the next millennium bring? Will Tempe even exist in Year 3015, and will anything from the present day survive the journey? 
 
 Experimental philosopher Jonathon Keats, famous for outrageous projects like genetically engineering deity and selling shares of his brain, this week revealed his latest thought-provoking endeavor — a millennium camera designed to take the slowest photograph in history. 
 
 RELATED: Biggest upcoming events around Phoenix 
 
 The low-tech device, basically a copper tube with a small, 24-carat gold aperture, is anchored to a third-floor terrace at the Arizona State University Art Museum and aimed directly at downtown Tempe. 
 
 Over the next 10 centuries, light will sneak through a pinhole and gradually etch a single image into the rose madder paint on the camera's back wall. Nothing fleeting will be captured, only the constant reflection of the landscape — buildings, streets and perhaps long-living trees. 
 
 If the Subway restaurant currently at Mill Avenue and 10th Street is someday replaced by a skyscraper, for example, the camera might capture a clear image of the new tower, overlapping a ghost image of the long-forgotten sandwich shop. 
 
 Keats, who lives in San Francisco and northern Italy, introduced 100-year-exposure cameras last year in Berlin, but Tempe is the first place he's installed the 1,000-year version. He also plans to put one at Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he studied philosophy, later this year. 
 
 While Keats approaches his thought experiments with the sincerity and eagerness of one who expects them to succeed, the projects serve to stoke conversation and curiosity regardless of their outcome. 
 
 For those involved with the millennium camera today, it's a mind-bending reach 40 generations into the future. And if anyone is around to open the capsule during a museum exhibition actually scheduled for 3015, the photo could provide an astounding visual history. 
 
 ""It is as much about the conceptual as it is about the photographic,"" Keats said. ""Acting in the present according to an awareness of the future ... can profoundly change the way we see and interact with the world."" 
 
 In a small way, the millennium camera is similar to a microscope or a telescope in that it extends a person's view, Keats said. ""Those were extending for the eye; this is extending for the mind's eye,"" he said. 
 
 The camera itself is on loan to the museum for the next 1,000 years, with ownership remaining with Keats, or the heir who can lay claim to it someday in the future. But the artwork, the image it captures, has been formally donated to ASU and assigned an acquisition number — 3015.001.000 — indicating the first item anticipated for collection that year. 
 
 Keats is also bringing an improved version of his 100-year cameras to the Valley and plans to spend much of the day Friday helping interested locals make their own. 
 
 The philosopher, artist and author will run an exhibit at ASU's Emerge 2015 festival at SkySong in Scottsdale, where visitors can make inexpensive tin-can century cameras. They are then expected to find a place within the city to anchor the camera and file the coordinates with the art museum. 
 
 ASU has also created paper versions of the camera, which people can cut out and fold themselves. ""When you're very old, tell a child where you've hidden your [camera], and ask the child to retrieve it in 2115,"" the directions say. 
 
 Emerge 2015, a showcase of the future through art, performance and hands-on experience, runs Friday from 3 p.m. to midnight at 1475 N. Scottsdale Road. 
 
 Keats chose metro Phoenix and specifically Tempe for his project, believing the area serves as a case study on how suburban communities might grow into urban centers of more-sustainable living. 
 
 ""It's perhaps one of the best models around for a way in which urbanization can happen over long periods of time,"" Keats said.

 ASU Art Museum to document next millennium of Tempe urbanization in history's slowest photograph 
 
 Tempe, Ariz. ï¿½ Boasting two interstate freeways and one of Arizona's largest shopping malls, the city of Tempe has been selected to represent the evolution of world civilization over the next thousand years. On Friday, March 6, 2015, the ASU Art Museum will install a camera designed by experimental philosopher Jonathon Keats to take a millennium-long photograph of the evolving Tempe skyline. The museum will unveil the photograph in a month-long exhibition scheduled for Spring 3015. 
 
 ï¿½The first people to see this picture will be children who haven't yet been conceived,ï¿½ says Keats. ï¿½They're impacted by every choice we make, but they're powerless. If they can't influence our decisions, at least they can bear witness.ï¿½ 
 
 To document the next thousand years of Tempe civilization, Keats has conceived a new approach to photography based on the traditional pinhole camera. ï¿½My photographic time capsule is extremely simple, since anything complicated is liable to break,ï¿½ says Keats. The solid metal camera uses oil paint in place of ordinary film. Pierced through a plate of 24-karat gold, a minuscule pinhole focuses light on the colored pigment, such that the color fades most where the light is brightest, very slowly creating a unique positive image of the scene in front of the camera. 
 
 ï¿½The photograph not only shows the skyline, but also records how it develops over time,ï¿½ Keats explains. ï¿½For instance, old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly, as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them.ï¿½ 
 
 According to ASU Art Museum Curator Garth Johnson, the millennium camera will be installed on the museum's third-level terrace, where museum visitors will be able to see both the city view and the photographic apparatus. ï¿½The ASU Art Museum is well-positioned to bear witness to the Tempe skyline as it evolves and changes,ï¿½ says Johnson. ï¿½The span involved in Keatsï¿½ vision is at once humbling and empowering for a forward-thinking institution like ours.ï¿½ 
 
 On Friday, March 6, 2015, at noon, Johnson will discuss these themes in conversation with Keats at a public lecture to be held on the museumï¿½s third-floor terrace. The camera unveiling is presented in conjunction with ASUï¿½s Center for Science and the Imagination and is free and open to the public. 
 
 Immediately following the museum event, Keats will lead a hands-on workshop on building deep time cameras as part of ASU's annual Emerge festival, set to take place March 6, 2015, from 3 p.m. to midnight, at the university's SkySong Innovation Center in Scottsdale. The event is free and open to the public, with registration requested through asuemerge2015.eventbrite.com. 
 
 As part of Keatsï¿½ workshop at Emerge, the public is invited to build a pinhole camera with a 100-year exposure time to hide somewhere in the Phoenix area, invisibly monitoring changes in the urban landscape between now and 2115. ï¿½I don't want to be the only deep time photographer on the planet,ï¿½ says Keats. ï¿½Millennial photography needs to be ubiquitous if it's to have an all-encompassing impact on us,ï¿½ he asserts, hinting that Tempe is just the first of many cities soon to have millennium cameras. 
 
 While the ASU Art Museum plans to host a second event in 3015, according to Johnson, Keats does not plan to attend. ï¿½I'll be dead,ï¿½ says Keats. ï¿½But I don't regret it at all. For me, it's much more interesting to be here today, seeing the behavior of people who know they're being watched by the unborn, and also to be watched myself, living vicariously as a future memory of the next millennium.ï¿½

 ||||| An image of conceptual artist Jonathon Keats' Century Camera, modified with an antique traditional camera. Keats' new project, the Millennium Camera, is designed to capture images over the course of 1,000 years. 
 
 In our era of instant digital photos and disposable everything, conceptual artist Jonathon Keats has decided to slow things down. Way down. 
 
 On Friday, Keats unveiled his new Millennium Camera installation -- a pinhole camera designed to track changes in the Arizona skyline over the next 1,000 years. 
 
 The project is literally an exponential expansion of his previous Century Camera project, which deployed cameras made for 100-year exposures in several cities around the world. 
 
 Eyes Vs. Cameras: How They See Things 
 
 Keats, who has been famously termed a “poet of ideas” by the New Yorker, specializes in these kinds of art-meets-science conceptual pieces. The idea behind both the Century Camera and Millennium Camera project is to spark thinking on environment and habitat, and the long-term impact that our choices will have on the lives of future generations. 
 
 Keats’ devices, which he designed himself, are based on the traditional pinhole camera, but crafted to be radically simple and durable. The solid metal camera uses oil paint instead of traditional film, with light coming in through a pinhole in a plate of 24-karat gold. 
 
 Over the years, the light fades the colored pigment, creating a positive image. “For instance, old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly, as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them,” Keats says. 
 
 360-Degree Camera Delivers Live Panoramic Video 
 
 In an email to Discovery News, Keats said that the intent of the Millennium Camera is slightly different than that of the Century Camera -- but both are built to last: “With a thousand years in view, the documentation will have less to do with urban development and will be more concerned with the changing environment. In other words, the photographs will show how our future climate transforms our terrestrial habitat.” 
 
 The exhibit will be installed on the museum’s third-level terrace, where museum visitors will be able to see both the device itself, and the skyline view of Tempe, Arizona, which the camera will capture with deep time focus. 
 
 If all goes well, the museum plans to unveil the photograph in a month-long exhibition scheduled for Spring, 3015. See you there. ||||| Jonathon Keats—a San Francisco-based experimental philosopher who has, over the years, sold real estate in the extra dimensions of space-time proposed by string theory (he sold a hundred and seventy-two extra-dimensional lots in the Bay Area in a single day); made an attempt to genetically engineer God (God turns out to be related to the cyanobacterium); and copyrighted his own mind (in order to get a seventy-year post-life extension)—came to New York a couple of weeks ago to exhibit his latest thought experiment: television for plants. In a landscape of conceptual art most often known for pure puzzlement or pallid preaching, Keats is a poet of ideas, whose work always rests on a solid basis of scientific research and resolves in a startling, semi-serious image. 
 
 The television-for-plants project has been installed in a fifth-floor space at the AC Institute, on West Twenty-seventh Street, in Chelsea. A collection of houseplants—the kind of rubber plants that your great-aunt watered and tended—rest on the floor, thoughtfully regarding a video on a screen above their heads. The video shows, on a six-and-a-half-minute loop, a beautiful Italian sky, which passes into night, complete with romantic Italian moon, and then returns to dawn. Visitors are urged to bring their own plants to watch the show. 
 
 Jon Keats—that really is his given name—has mastered an expression so sincere that one begins to suspect him of irony. With that look embossed on his face, he explained to a visitor, the other day, that television for plants was an extension of an earlier project to make pornography for plants. “Pornography is where every filmmaker starts out,” he said evenly, “and in my case I was making pornography for plants by filming bees pollinating flowers.” There were two different shows of plant porn: one in Chico, California, for about a hundred rhododendrons, and one at Montana State University, for as many zinnias. “I knew that the act of pollination was the most titillating experience for plants,” Keats said. “So I spent a couple of days on the ground, seeing how light and shadow were experienced from their perspective. Once I had a very stark black-and-white image—sun up high, bees flying by. I let it run for a month, and let the plants experience vicarious sex. And let people stand at the periphery and giggle nervously.” 
 
 He continued, “So I decided to go on to other plant subjects, and to me the subject that would be most interesting to plants is travel. Plants don’t get to go anywhere. They’re rooted in the ground. But if you’re a plant you’re not going to get excited about the Eiffel Tower—instead, you’re going to be excited about the sky.” 
 
 Keats filmed an Italian sky over two months. “We know that plants experience light very differently in different parts of the spectrum,” he said. “Both NASA and the Soviet-era agronomy schools studied this problem closely, because of their interest in how to grow plants in space or indoors in Siberia. I wanted to think of it not as manipulation of plants but as entertainment and edification for them. I knew that they could experience color, and—knowing that where you are in the world will have a great effect on what color relationships you experience—I wanted to bring that whole specific set of color experiences to plants, which would otherwise never be able to get to Italy.” (Keats also included jet trails in the video, because “I didn’t want to be too pastoral. I didn’t want to idealize Italy for the plants. These are travel documentaries, not advertisements to get plants to travel.”) 
 
 The plants, soberly observing their entertainment, seem wholesomely unmanipulated. But Keats is also aware of the small didactic point lurking in the project. “What I’m always doing is trying to pose thought experiments in the old-fashioned philosophical way,” he said, “imagining from a radically different perspective circumstances that are very familiar to us, in order to make them unfamiliar and force us to start to pull them apart. So if your children are supposedly vegetating in front of the television when they watch it for hours, what happens when you show television to vegetables? I don’t have the answers, or I wouldn’t make the work.” ♦","– A low-tech camera installed on a terrace in Tempe, Arizona, is busy taking a photo—that should capture one image over the next thousand years, the Arizona Republic reports. Conceptual artist Jonathon Keats says his device will actually show 10 centuries of change in a single shot: ""The photograph not only shows the skyline, but also records how it develops over time,"" he says in an Arizona State University press release. ""For instance, old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly, as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them."" So why invent such a camera? Because, he says, he wants us to consider the image and reflect on how our choices will affect the environment. ""You can look at the scale of time beyond the human life span,"" he says in another Arizona Republic piece. That can help you look ""reflectively back on yourself from the context of the future, putting what you're doing today in the context of that longer term,"" he adds. Unlike those words, Keats' camera is simple: made from solid metal, it has a pinhole in a 24-karat-gold plate that lets light hit colored pigment, and slowly create an image with oil paint instead of film. If all goes well, the ASU Art Museum (which houses the camera) plans to display the image in 3015, Discovery reports. Keats has also helped people make simpler, tin-can cameras that capture 100-year images for future generations. Dubbed a ""poet of ideas"" by the New Yorker, San Francisco-based Keats has done other unusual things—like sell real estate in extra space-time dimensions, copyright his mind, and try to engineer God genetically.

250,"If Donald Trump was looking for a way to upstage the Ted Cruz-John Kasich alliance, he just did. Big time. The Republican presidential front-runner signed a peace treaty of his own on Monday evening, agreeing to a one-on-one interview with Fox News Channel's Megyn Kelly — his media nemesis and a journalist he has called ""the most overrated person on TV."" 
 
 ""Mr. Trump and I sat down together for a meeting earlier this month at my request,"" Kelly said in a statement. ""He was gracious with his time, and I asked him to consider an interview. I am happy to announce he has agreed, and I look forward to a fascinating exchange — our first sit-down interview together in nearly a year."" 
 
 [The long, strange history of the Donald Trump-Megyn Kelly feud] 
 
 This deal, once almost impossible to imagine, represents a victory for both sides. For Trump, in the short run, it allows him to once again take attention away from his rivals, heading into Tuesday's slate of five primary contests in which he appears likely to perform well. More broadly — barring a total meltdown in the interview — it should help him re-cast his image, a process he has already begun in earnest. The genesis of the feud was a question from Kelly in a debate last August about whether the surly billionaire possesses a presidential ""temperament."" Trump hasn't shown one throughout most of the primary season, but being cordial with Kelly could make him look more statesmanlike. 
 
 And for Kelly, scoring this interview — which seems certain to be a ratings blockbuster — is a testament to patience and professionalism. She refused to cower as Trump hurled insults, yet she never responded with the same kind of personal vitriol. On her weekday primetime show, ""The Kelly File,"" she has often represented Trump's perspective in exchanges with his critics, if only as a devil's advocate. She has been playing the long game all along, perhaps sensing that her level-headedness would eventually pay off. 
 
 The meeting Kelly referenced in her statement took place at Trump Tower in New York on April 13 and was the first major sign that tensions were beginning to ease. The ""Kelly File"" host told her viewers that night that she and the real estate magnate ""had a chance to clear the air"" after months of acrimony and that she hoped to announce an interview agreement soon. 
 
 Now that it's on, the Trump-Kelly sit-down will headline a previously announced special on Fox broadcasting called ""Megyn Kelly Presents"" on May 17. Fox said in a statement Monday that the hourlong telecast will include interviews with ""a wide variety of notable guests (to be announced) from the entertainment world and other spheres of human interest."" Kelly's regular primetime show on Fox News the next night will feature additional footage from her conversation with Trump. ||||| Fox News host Megyn Kelly will interview Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in a Fox TV special to air next month. 
 
 The GOP presidential front-runner will be a guest on ""Megyn Kelly Presents,"" a prime-time special airing May 17 on Fox TV. Extended portions of the sit-down interview will also appear on ""The Kelly File"" on Fox News Channel beginning on May 18. 
 
 The interview, which will take place in New York, marks the first sit-down between the two since the August 2015 presidential debate on Fox News Channel. 
 
 Kelly will explore how events unfolded with Trump after the August debate as one of the most prominent voices covering the 2016 presidential campaign of the front-runner, according to a statement from Fox News. 
 
 She will also examine Trump’s successful campaign for the White House to date and his role in one of the most historic presidential runs in modern times. 
 
 ""Mr. Trump and I sat down together for a meeting earlier this month at my request. He was gracious with his time and I asked him to consider an interview. I am happy to announce he has agreed, and I look forward to a fascinating exchange — our first sit-down interview together in nearly a year,” Kelly said in a statement announcing the upcoming interview. 
 
 In addition to the Trump interview, “Megyn Kelly Presents” will feature a wide variety of notable guests from the entertainment world and other spheres of human interest to be interviewed by Kelly. The full list of guests will be announced at a later date.

 Jacksonville’s minor league baseball team is having its usual Thirsty Thursday promotion this week with discounted beer — 12 ounces for $1, 24 ounces for $2. But this Thursday there’s a second promotion: You Might Be the Father’s Day. 
 
 That’s right. In honor of Sunday being Father’s Day, the Jumbo Shrimp will distribute free pregnancy tests at Thursday’s game. 
 
 ""So you’ll know if you need to return for Sunday’s Father’s Day game,"" the team’s website explains. ""It will be an evening filled with suspense, intrigue and manila envelopes."" 
 
 Suspense, intrigue and manila envelopes. 
 
 The promotion has already gotten its share of attention. The Washington Post, which tends to collect odd minor league promotions, quickly jumped on the story Monday, adding this promise General Manager Harold Craw made in March: 
 
 ""Whether our guests are here for the first time or have supported the team for years, we seek to create entertainment and promotions that delight the whole family."" 
 
 The Post also drew a cutting connection to Charleston (S.C.) RiverDogs’ famous yet ill-fated attempt at Vasectomy Night, when one lucky fan would get a free snipping. That, however, was cancelled after the mayor and a local bishop complained. 
 
 Craw said Monday the pregnancy test came up just like all the other ideas do. 
 
 ""We were just sitting around at the promotion meeting, looking at our calendar,"" he said. ""That’s something that plays to our Thirsty Thursday crowd, which tends to be young professionals and college students. They like to laugh and have a good time and would appreciate it being tongue-in-cheek."" 
 
 Craw said he team has several hundred of the pregnancy tests ready to hand out. 
 
 ""We’ll give it to them if they want one,"" he said. ""But at that point, it’s completely up to them. They’re on their own."" 
 
 Unusual promotions have long been a staple of minor league baseball, and team names have been increasingly following suit. The Jumbo Shrimp were hatched last November, the name replacing the Suns, which the team had held for most of the previous 54 years. 
 
 So far this season, Craw said, the team is averaging about 5,600 fans a game, an increase of 1,500 over last season. But despite the cheap beer, Thirsty Thursdays are only the third most popular day, behind Friday and Saturday. 
 
 By the way, the Jumbo Shrimp are playing the Pensacola Blue Wahoos on Thursday at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville. The first pitch is scheduled at 7:05 p.m. 
 
 On Sunday, for those who do return for the Father’s Day game, the first pitch is at 3:05 p.m. Saturday, also by the way, is Girl Scout Night.

252,"Penis inadequacy is a real fear. Guys might not see it plastered across billboards as much as women have body image ideals foisted on them, but the pop culture zeitgeist certainly makes it known: Bigger is better. 
 
 So, curious about how Millennial women really felt about their partners' penises, Cosmopolitan.com polled 1,100 readers (96 percent women, 4 percent men; between the ages of 18 and 34). And just so we don't leave you hanging: 89 percent said they were not worried about their boyfriend's penis size, and, when asked how they'd classify their partner's penis, most of them (56 percent) went with ""average."" Another 33 percent thought their partner's penis was on the large side.

 Interestingly, participants were pretty close when it came to what they considered and average penis size. (The current actual average sizes are 3.5 inches flaccid, and 5.1 inches erect.) Even though 43 percent of respondents said they watch porn at least once a month, which can skew peoples' perceptions of penis size, they seem to be pretty realistic when it comes to IRL sex. 
 
 In the end, despite 59 percent of women reporting that they were less than satisfied in the bedroom, the vast majority said they wouldn't change anything about their boyfriend's penis. (A handful of participants noted they would actually make his penis slightly smaller.) Maybe guys are finally getting the message that penetration isn't women's greatest desire in bed, given that the survey found 62 percent of respondents rarely or never orgasm from penetration alone. 
 
 Basically, it seems like Millennial women are just fine with whatever penis. Although he might not be porn-star-size, penis beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Or the hand of the holder. Like, hand jobs. OK, have a great day.

 Follow Frank on Twitter. ||||| Surgeons in Florida have given a 17-year-old boy what’s being called the “world’s first” penis reduction surgery. 
 
 The teen came to doctors complaining of a penis “too large for intercourse,” according to an article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, published online in November. He was also unable to play sports or even wear most clothing without his phallus showing through the fabric. 
 
 The penis was 7 inches long and had a circumference of 10 inches, according to the Daily Mail. That’s about the same size as an average mayonnaise jar, based on measurements taken by HuffPost Weird. 
 
 “His penis had inflated like a balloon,” Rafael Carrion, a urologist at the University of South Florida who treated the patient, told the Daily Mail. 
 
 The shape and massive size of the penis was the result of the teen’s sickle cell anemia. Irregular blood cells would block penile blood vessels and lead to swelling and priapism — a long-lasting and painful erection. This had happened three times since the boy was 10, which “progressively led” to a deformed penis, according to the Journal. 
 
 Carrion said he couldn’t find any precedent for penis reduction surgery. His team ended up opting to slice along the patient’s circumcision scar, unwrap the skin, and then remove chunks of tissue from each side. 
 
 He added that the teen is “very satisfied” with his new penis, which is still “generous” in size but is now more standard in appearance.

 Contact The Author","– In a study ostensibly about whether women care if penises have been surgically repaired to treat distal hypospadias (when the urethra's opening is on the underside of the penis), scientists learned which characteristics of male genitalia matter most to a woman. Reporting in the Journal of Sexual Medicine under the title, ""What is a Good Looking Penis?"" Swiss researchers find that, at least among the 105 women they surveyed, the position and shape of the urethral opening is the least important of eight characteristics—a potentially reassuring finding for the men affected by what the researchers frame as one of the ""most common penile malformations."" It's thought to occur in about 0.3% to 0.5% of male births, and while it's generally surgically corrected within the first year of life, ""men with an operated hypospadias are reported to be more dissatisfied with their penile appearance."" So where do length and girth fall on the importance scale? Near the bottom, at Nos. six and seven, respectively. Here's what matters most to the women, who ranged in age from 16 to 45: the somewhat vague ""general cosmetic appearance,"" followed by, in order, skin, glans shape, scrotum appearance, and pubic hair appearance. And with age comes acceptance: ""The multiple regression analyses indicated that the older and the more sexually interested a woman is, the more normal she perceives the appearance of a penis to be.""

 UN observers have counted at least 90 bodies, including 32 children, after a Syrian government attack on a town. 
 
 UN mission head Maj-Gen Robert Mood told the BBC the killing in Houla was ""indiscriminate and unforgivable"". 
 
 UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he would seek a strong global response to the ""appalling crime"". UN chief Ban Ki-moon said it was a ""flagrant violation of international law"". 
 
 Syria's government has blamed the deaths on ""armed terrorist gangs"". 
 
 This is one of the bloodiest attacks in one area since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. 
 
 Activists say some of the victims died by shelling, while others were summarily executed, or butchered by the regime militia known as the ""shabiha"". 
 
 UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan, and the Arab League have also condemned Friday's assault. 
 
 France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was making immediate arrangements for a Paris meeting of the Friends of Syria group, which includes Western and Arab nations, but not Russia or China, who have blocked previous attempts to introduce UN sanctions. 
 
 Fighting in Syria has continued despite the deployment of some 250 UN observers monitoring a ceasefire brokered by Mr Annan - a ceasefire which the BBC's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon says is now ""pretty fictional"". 
 
 The UN says at least 10,000 have been killed since the protests began. 
 
 UN 'refused to come' 
 
 A joint statement from Mr Ban and Mr Annan said firing heavy weapons into a residential neighbourhood was a ""flagrant violation of international law"" which must stop and those responsible should be held to account. 
 
 Analysis Initial reports from activists of more than 90 civilians killed in a ""massacre"" at Houla were met with the usual caution. But a visit by the UN monitors confirmed that the reality was as horrendous as the gruesome internet videos portrayed. The observers have been criticised for not preventing the carnage in the first place. But they were at least able to verify what happened, and document the deadly use of government artillery and tank fire, even if they could not explain the circumstances leading to the carnage. That means that if [UN-Arab League envoy] Kofi Annan goes to Damascus next week, as he is expected to do in a bid to salvage his six-point peace plan, his argument that government troops and tanks must withdraw will be strengthened. But with the Free Syrian Army threatening to scrap even notional commitment to the battered ceasefire, events on the ground are clearly outpacing peace efforts. With international action from the Security Council ruled out, the trend towards arming the rebels and fuelling a civil war may gather force. 
 
 Mr Annan would be contacting Syria's government to ""convey in the clearest terms the expectations of the international community, and he will also do so during his forthcoming visit to Syria"", it said. 
 
 Mr Hague said he would be calling for an urgent session of the UN Security Council in the coming days. 
 
 Arab League head Nabil al-Arabi called the assault a ""horrific crime"" and urged the Security Council to ""stop the escalation of killing and violence by armed gangs and government military forces,"" the Reuters news agency reports. 
 
 The opposition Free Syrian Army says it can no longer commit to the ceasefire unless the Security Council can ensure that civilians are protected, the AFP news agency reports. 
 
 Horrific video footage has emerged from Houla of dozens of dead children, covered in blood, their arms and legs strewn over one another. It is unverified, but our correspondent says such images would be difficult to fake. 
 
 International media cannot report freely in Syria and it is impossible to verify reports of violence. 
 
 A team of UN observers visited the town on Saturday and afterwards Maj-Gen Mood said they could confirm ""the use of small arms, machine gun[s], artillery and tanks."" 
 
 But he did not say who was behind the killings. 
 
 Our correspondent says local people are angry that the observers failed to intervene to stop the killing. 
 
 Abu Emad, speaking from Houla, said their appeals to the monitors failed to produce action. 
 
 ""We told them at night, we called seven of them. We told them the massacre is being committed right now at Houla by the mercenaries of this regime and they just refused to come and stop the massacre."" 
 
 The opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) said more than 110 people died. The SNC's Ausama Monajed told the BBC the regime was selecting vulnerable towns to ""teach the entire country a lesson"". 
 
 ""It is beyond humanity what we have seen,"" he said.

 Activists called a day of mourning on Saturday. 
 
 Earlier, in a letter to the Security Council, Mr Ban said the Syrian opposition controlled ""significant parts of some cities"". 
 
 He said that ""established terrorist groups"" could have been behind some of the recent bomb blasts in Syria judging from the sophistication of the attacks. 
 
 He said the situation remained ""extremely serious"" and urged states not to arm either side in the conflict. 
 
 Earlier this month, a bombing in Damascus left 55 dead in an attack which the government blamed on al-Qaeda. The attack came amid mounting fears that the terrorist group was taking advantage of the conflict to gain a foothold. 
 
 On Thursday, a UN-mandated panel said Syrian security forces were to blame for most abuses in the conflict, which has continued despite the presence of the UN observers. 
 
 Mr Annan's six-point peace agreement ordered a cessation of violence on 12 April. While casualties appeared to fall after the truce, the fighting quickly resumed to previous levels. ||||| Activists on Saturday raised the number of those killed in an alleged massacre by Syrian regime forces in a region in the center of the country to more than 90.

 The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that more than 90 people had been killed in the Houla area in the 24 hours since midday Friday. 
 
 A local activist giving his name as Abu Yazan reached via Skype said 12 people died in shelling and 106 were killed when pro-regime thugs known as shabiha stormed the area. 
 
 That death toll is one of the highest for any single event since the popular uprising against Bashar Assad began in March 2011. The U.N. says more than 9,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians. 
 
 The new violence in Houla is also a further blow to a U.N. peace plan for Syria that was supposed to start with a cease-fire between government troops and rebels on April 12 but has never really taken hold. 
 
 More than 250 U.N. observers are now deployed in Syria to oversee the truce, and a spokesman for the team said Saturday that observers were heading to Houla. 
 
 A local activist reached via Skype said regime forces started shelling the village of Houla, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the city of Homs in west-central Syria following an anti-regime demonstration following Muslim prayers on Friday. Twelve people were killed in the shelling, said the activist, who gave his name as Abu Yazan. 
 
 Later, pro-regime thugs known as shabiha stormed the village of Taldaw, just south of Houla, raiding homes and shooting at civilians. 
 
 ""They killed entire families, from parents on down to children, but they focused on the children,"" he said. 
 
 Amateur videos posted online showed many children among the dozens of dead laid out in different rooms and covered with sheets and blankets. One video showed 14 dead children lined up on a floor, shoulder to shoulder. 
 
 Abu Yazan said most residents were fleeing the area Saturday, fearing further killings. 
 
 Activist claims and videos could not be independently verified. The Syrian government bars most media from operating inside the country. 
 
 News of the killings elicited harsh condemnations from anti-regime groups, many of which have expressed frustration with international reluctance to intervene in Syria's conflict. 
 
 Bassma Kodmani of the exile opposition Syrian National Council called on the U.N. Security Council ""to examine the situation in Houla and to determine the responsibility of the United Nations in the face of such mass killings, expulsions and forced migration from entire neighborhoods."" 
 
 The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights released an unusually harsh statement, saying Arab nations and the international community were ""partners"" in the killing ""because of their silence about the massacres that the Syrian regime has committed."" ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story 
 
 BEIRUT, Lebanon — More than 90 people, including at least 32 children under the age of 10, were killed in a central Syrian village, top United Nations officials said Saturday, accusing the government of perpetrating the “indiscriminate” shelling of civilian neighborhoods. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In one of the worst episodes of carnage since the uprising began 15 months ago, Syrian tanks and artillery pounded Houla, a rebel-controlled village near the restive city of Homs, during the day, opposition groups said, then soldiers and pro-government fighters stormed the village and killed families in their homes late at night. 
 
 Amateur videos said to be taken in the aftermath showed row after row of victims, many of them small children with what appeared to be bullet holes in their temples. Other videos showed gruesome shrapnel wounds caused by what activists said was a barrage of shelling that started Friday in response to demonstrations after the weekly prayer service and that continued Saturday. 
 
 United Nations monitors visiting the village on Saturday counted at least 92 bodies and found spent tank shells, which they cited as evidence that the Syrian military had violated its part of a truce in firing heavy artillery at civilians. A United Nations statement said the observers confirmed that “artillery and tank shells were fired at a residential neighborhood.”

 International officials largely blamed the government. 
 
 Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, and Kofi Annan, his predecessor and envoy to Syria, issued a scathing condemnation. 
 
 “This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms,” the top United Nations officials said in a statement. They called on Syria to stop using heavy weapons in population centers and for all sides to cease violence. 
 
 The White House said the attack was “a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality.”

 Gory images posted online — particularly the scene of rows of dead children smeared with blood — prompted an emotional outpouring of antigovernment demonstrations across Syria and calls for sectarian revenge. 
 
 Activists said that much of the slaughter had been carried out by pro-government thugs, or “shabiha,” from the area. Houla is a Sunni Muslim town, while three villages around it are mostly Alawite, the religion of President Bashar al-Assad and whose adherents are the core of his security forces. A fourth village is Shiite Muslim. 
 
 A man in a black knitted mask who appeared on one YouTube video, for example, said it was time “to prepare for vengeance against this awful sectarian regime.” 
 
 The rebel Free Syrian Army, the loose federation of armed militias across the country, issued a statement saying it was no longer committed to the United Nations truce because the plan was merely buying time for the government to kill civilians and destroy cities and villages.

 “We won’t allow truce after truce, which prolongs the crisis for years,” the statement said. 
 
 The Syrian government blamed “terrorists,” its catchall phrase for the opposition, for killing the civilians. 
 
 State television repeatedly broadcast pictures of members of one household who had been massacred, calling the deaths “part of the ugly crimes that the terrorists are committing against the Syrians with the financial support of some Arab states and others.” 
 
 SANA, the state-run news agency, said that “armed terrorist groups attacked law-enforcement forces and civilians” in the nearby town of Teldo, which prompted security forces to “intervene and engage the terrorists.” 
 
 But the direct accusation from the United Nations, which is monitoring the tattered April 12 cease-fire, rebutted the government’s standard claim that outsiders or their domestic dupes are to blame for the violence. 
 
 Syria sharply limits access to the country for foreign correspondents, making independent verification of events there difficult. But there has been a pattern of similar government assaults in recent months against villages sympathetic to the opposition. 
 
 Activists said that there had been firefights between the armed opposition that controlled the village and the government forces besieging it. Although the United Nations statements called for stopping violence on both sides, neither suggested that the opposition was involved in the deaths of civilians in Houla. 
 
 The massacre also prompted new questions about the continued effectiveness of the truce just as Mr. Annan, the architect of the plan, headed to Damascus. The opposition has criticized the truce, and the United Nations peacekeepers who came with it, as ineffective. There are 271 unarmed military observers on the ground in Syria, nearly the entire contingent of 300 approved by the Security Council, as well as numerous civilian workers. 
 
 The observers produced a quick assessment, the first time they have issued a publicly damning report so soon after an episode of violence. Despite their efforts, as well as the unusual step of the United Nations directly accusing the government of perpetrating major violence, the massacre soured Syrians even more on their presence, since the killing took place despite observers being deployed in nearby Homs. 
 
 The United Nations observers reported that in addition to the more than 90 dead, they counted more than 300 wounded, Mr. Annan’s spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said. Opposition groups put the death toll at around 100 killed, including 50 children. 
 
 The United Nations statement stopped short of accusing the government of responsibility for the entire toll. 
 
 Gen. Robert Mood, the head of the United Nations observer mission in Syria, said in a statement that “the killing of innocent children and civilians needs to stop,” but added that the circumstances behind all the deaths remained “unclear.” 
 
 In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton focused on what she described as the “vicious assault that involved a regime artillery and tank barrage on a residential neighborhood.”

 “Those who perpetrated this atrocity must be identified and held to account,” she said in a statement. “And the United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end.” 
 
 Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, issued a statement accusing Syria’s government of committing “new massacres” and added that France would organize a meeting of the roughly 80-member Friends of Syria group as soon as possible. 
 
 The British foreign secretary, William Hague, said Britain was looking for a strong international response and hoped to convene an “urgent” session of the United Nations Security Council “in the coming days.” 
 
 The Syrian National Council, the umbrella opposition organization in exile, condemned the killing and called for three days of mourning. 
 
 Details of what happened were murky, as is often the case in Syria. 
 
 Saleem Kabani, an activist reached via Skype who said he was in the town, said that government forces had shelled Houla heavily all day Friday, also raking it with machine-gun fire and firing mortar shells. There had already been a substantial toll from that assault, he and others said, with some residents killed as their houses collapsed. 
 
 Then gunmen from the Free Syrian Army left the center of the town to try to assault the government checkpoints from which much of the barrage originated, he said. 
 
 Taking advantage of the absence of any armed men inside the village late Friday, government soldiers moved in, along with volunteers from surrounding hamlets, to kill civilians, Mr. Kabani said. 
 
 Another activist in Homs reached via Skype, using only the name Saif, said the people of Houla were demonstrating on Saturday despite renewed shelling. Activists in Houla had told him that more bodies were left on roads exposed to government fire and in houses, he said. 
 
 The government appeared to have anticipated the demonstrations that took place on Saturday in solidarity with Houla. Damascus took on the look of an armed camp on Saturday, with closed shops and a heavy military presence. 
 
 Activists reported demonstrations in at least 10 neighborhoods. Few protesters seemed to accept the government version of events. “The regime kills thousands of Syrian citizens, and Annan’s monitors are watching and writing the number of killed people as if they were game scores,” said Fadi, a 25-year-old demonstrator in the southern Damascus district of Qaddam.","– Six weeks after a supposed cease-fire, the UN has confirmed that pro-government forces killed at least 90 civilians yesterday, including more than two dozen children, reports the BBC.

 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his pediatrician wife Priscilla Chan announce an ambitious $3 billion effort to eradicate disease. (Photo: Jeff Chiu, Associated Press) 
 
 SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his pediatrician wife, Priscilla Chan, are launching an ambitious effort to spend $3 billion over the next decade to cure disease. 
 
 The goal is to ""work together to cure, prevent or manage all disease within our children's lifetime,"" Dr. Chan said during an event in San Francisco for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple's philanthropic group. 
 
 Dr. Chan spoke through tears as she recalled telling parents their child had an incurable disease or could not be revived, experiences she said made her even more determined to work with scientists and engineers to build new tools that can save lives by the end of the century. 
 
 Zuckerberg, who took the stage after his wife's remarks, said he and Chan want to ""make a better future for our children."" 
 
 As part of the investment, the couple is funding a $600 million research center in San Francisco called the Biohub that is a partnership with UC San Francisco, Stanford University and UC Berkeley. Neurobiologist Cori Bargmann is signing on as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's president of science. 
 
 Last December, the couple celebrated the birth of a baby girl with the stunning announcement they plan to give away most of their fortune through a new initiative to ""advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation."" The Facebook founder and his physician wife pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook shares in their lifetime. So far the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has made investments in an African coding start-up called Andela and Indian education start-up Byju. 
 
 Zuckerberg and Chan have drawn parallels to Microsoft founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates and wife Melinda, known for their philanthropic efforts. 
 
 Gates on Wednesday praised the couple, who have already made substantial investments in education, for ""taking on another bold challenge."" 
 
 ""This idea of curing and preventing all diseases by the end of the century, that's very bold, very ambitious,"" Gates said during remarks at the event. ""I can't think of a better partnership to take it on,"" Gates said, noting Zuckerberg's risk-taking entrepreneurial chops and Chan's medical bonafides. 
 
 ""They both love science and they are both very committed to where it can take us,"" Gates said. 
 
 Biohub, the new independent research facility in San Francisco, will develop new tools to measure and treat disease. It will bring together leading scientists from UC San Francisco, Stanford University and UC Berkeley, Chan said. 
 
 Joseph DeRisi, a UCSF biochemist, and Stephen Quake, a Stanford professor of bioengineering, will run the facility. It is embarking on its first two research projects: The Cell Atlas, a map of the different types of cells that control the body's major organs, and the Infectious Disease Initiative, which will explore new approaches and develop new tools for creating drugs, diagnostic tests and vaccines that could aid the fight against such threats as HIV, Ebola and Zika.

 ""Future scientific advances likely will be at the interface of different disciplines — a 'convergence' that requires breaking down barriers between fields. This is exactly what Biohub is planning,"" David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize winner and professor at the California Institute of Technology wrote in an editorial published Wednesday. 
 
 Chan said she and Zuckerberg spent two years talking to scientists. ""We believe that the future we all want for our children is possible. We set a goal: Can we cure all diseases in our children's lifetime? That does't mean that no one will ever get sick. But it does mean that our children and their children should get sick a lot less. And that we should be able to detect and treat or at least manage it as an ongoing condition,"" she said. 
 
 In his remarks, Zuckerberg laid out his vision for eradicating disease: bring engineers and scientists together to more swiftly build new tools to advance efforts to tackle leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, infectious diseases and neurological diseases. 
 
 He also called for investments in artificial intelligence to probe the brain, machine learning to explore cancer genomes, computer chips to detect infectious disease and bloodstream monitors to catch diseases. 
 
 ""Today, just four kinds of diseases cause the majority of deaths. We can make progress on all of them with the right technology,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. ""Throughout history, most scientific breakthroughs have been preceded by the invention of new tools to help us see problems in new ways -- like the telescope, the microscope and DNA sequencing. It's not hard to imagine the modern tools required to accelerate breakthroughs in today's four major disease area. So we're going to focus on bringing scientists and engineers together to build these new tools and technologies."" 
 
 This is a long-term effort, Zuckerberg cautioned. ""We plan to invest billions of dollars over decades,"" he said. ""But it will take years for these tools to be developed and longer to put them into full use. This is hard and we need to be patient, but it's important.""

255,"Is There A 'War On Police'? The Statistics Say No 
 
 Enlarge this image toggle caption Aaron M. Sprecher/Getty Images Aaron M. Sprecher/Getty Images 
 
 The ambush-style murder of Sheriff Deputy Darren Goforth at a gas station in suburban Houston on Aug. 29 has added new urgency to warnings about a growing ""war on cops"" in America. After the arrest of the suspect, an African-American man named Shannon J. Miles, the local district attorney called for more public support for law enforcement. 
 
 ""It is time for the silent majority in this country to support law enforcement,"" said Devon Anderson, the Harris County DA. ""There are a few bad apples in every profession. That does not mean there should be open warfare declared on law enforcement."" 
 
 The notion of growing ""warfare"" against police stems in part from a statistical jump in the number of law officers murdered — ""feloniously killed,"" in the jargon of the FBI's numbers. 
 
 In 2014, the year of the Ferguson protests and increased media attention on police misconduct, 51 officers were killed nationwide. That was a jump from the 27 killed in 2013 and many took it as a sign of greater danger for police. 
 
 Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and an assistant law professor at the University of South Carolina, calls that interpretation ""nonsense."" 
 
 ""It's misleading to compare one year to another year,"" he says. 
 
 toggle caption Source: Seth Stoughton's analysis of the FBI's LEOKA data, consolidated by the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics. Credit: Camila Domonoske/NPR 
 
 Stoughton has been collecting and analyzing these data going back decades. He says 2014 looked bad in comparison with 2013 mainly because 2013 was so good. 
 
 ""2013 was the safest year for police officers, ever,"" he says. ""The safest year in recorded history."" 
 
 In fact, in the larger scheme of things, 2014 looks pretty normal. The number of murders of police was about the same as 2012, and actually a lot lower than 2011. 
 
 The long-term trend is even more encouraging: On average, only about half as many police are murdered every year now, as compared with the 1970s. Stoughton says some of that improvement is probably due to better training, better gear and radically improved trauma care for cops who are shot. 
 
 But he says the numbers suggest officers are also facing fewer attacks: The number of assaults on police has also fallen, though not as sharply. 
 
 Stoughton says he's not saying police work isn't dangerous — it certainly is. And he also admits we may be seeing a few more ambush killings — cops attacked just because they're cops. 
 
 But it's hard to isolate motives in these numbers, and any uptick is probably in the single digits. 
 
 ""When we're talking about 780,000 state and local police officers who are interacting with people on 67 million occasions every year, the increase from five to eight, or five to 10 — statistically, it doesn't look significant,"" he says. 
 
 But statistical analysis is cold comfort to police officers after a colleague has been ambushed. Some officers have been understandably shaken. 
 
 In a video that made the rounds soon after the Texas deputy was killed, a Miami officer named Lydia Marquez records herself in her car. 
 
 ""When I kiss my children in the morning before I go to work, I don't know if I'm going to be coming back at the end of the day,"" she says. ""Especially nowadays."" 
 
 Marquez ends her video defiantly, with the phrase that's become a rallying cry for many cops since Ferguson: ""All lives matter. Everyone's life matters."" 
 
 I think that this 'war on cops' rhetoric is just another way to protect police from accountability. 
 
 ""All lives matter"" may sound noble, but activists hear it as code for something else. 
 
 ""The way that people use the phrase is in direct opposition to 'Black Lives Matter,' "" says Daunasia Yancey, a prominent member of the Black Lives Matter movement in Boston. 
 
 ""I think that this 'war on cops' rhetoric is just another way to protect police from accountability,"" she says. ""What they're facing is not violence; it's accountability."" 
 
 Soon after Goforth's murder, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick condemned what he called the ""negative attitude"" toward police. Accused of using the killing to shut down legitimate criticism of police, Patrick took aim at the media. On the public radio show Texas Standard, the host tried to ask him about all the recent videos showing police misconduct. 
 
 U.S. What Happens When A Police Officer Doesn't Shoot? What Happens When A Police Officer Doesn't Shoot? Listen · 4:24 4:24 
 
 ""Your type of interview has to stop,"" Patrick said. 
 
 ""Yes, there are people in every profession who cross the line and should be fired,"" he continued. ""Quit focusing on that small percentage of those in law enforcement who have made a mistake."" 
 
 Edward Conlon, a retired New York police detective who writes about police work, says his former colleagues feel unfairly judged by the mistakes of a few. He says they haven't seen evidence of a ""war on cops,"" but they do feel embattled when it comes to public opinion. 
 
 It's not even half right that cops are at war with black America, and it's not even half right that there's a war on cops. 
 
 ""The notion that there is an epidemic of violence by police is just a really hard thing to swallow,"" he says. 
 
 And he sees a parallel here. He thinks both sides are guilty of drawing dramatic conclusions from isolated cases. 
 
 ""It's not even half right that cops are at war with black America, and it's not even half right that there's a war on cops, in any big or broad sense,"" Conlon says. 
 
 But there does seem to be at least one kind of war going on: a war of perceptions, driven by competing feelings of grievance. ||||| 58% Think There's A War on Police in America Today 
 
 With officers murdered in Texas and Illinois in just the last few days, most voters now believe the police are under attack in America and blame politicians critical of the cops for fanning the flames. 
 
 The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 58% of Likely U.S. Voters think there is a war on police in America today. Just 27% disagree, while 15% are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.) 
 
 Sixty percent (60%) believe comments critical of the police by some politicians make it more dangerous for police officers to do their jobs. Only 18% think those comments improve the quality of the police’s performance. Thirteen percent (13%) say the politicians’ comments have no impact. 
 
 While there is usually a wide racial difference of opinion on questions related to the police, most black voters (54%) agree with the majority of white (60%) and other minority voters (56%) that there is a war on police underway. 
 
 Blacks (36%) are far less likely than whites (66%) and other minorities (55%), however, to say the comments of some politicians are making it more dangerous for the police. There’s very little belief in any of the groups, though, that the comments are improving police performance. 
 
 Protests against the police have been growing since the killing in August 2014 of a black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, although a grand jury did not indict the officer for any wrongdoing. That incident followed by several similar ones around the country led to the establishment of the “Black Lives Matter” movement to protest perceived racist behavior by many police officers. 
 
 Eighty-two percent (82%) of black voters think most black Americans receive unfair treatment from the police. White voters by a 56% to 30% margin disagree. Other minority voters are evenly divided. 
 
 (Want a free daily e-mail update? If it's in the news, it's in our polls). Rasmussen Reports updates are also available on Twitter or Facebook. 
 
 The survey of 1,000 Likely Voters was conducted on August 31-September 1, 2015 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See methodology. 
 
 Seventy-two percent (72%) of Americans have a favorable view of the police in the area where they live. Most (66%) also approve of the tactics used by their local police officers. 
 
 Those under 40 believe even more strongly than their elders that there is a war on police going on, but these younger voters are less likely to think politicians critical of the police are making it worse. 
 
 Seventy-eight percent (78%) of Republicans think there is a war on police now, compared to 48% of Democrats and 52% of voters not affiliated with either major party. 
 
 Twenty-six percent (26%) of Democrats believe political comments critical of the police are improving the officers’ performance, but just 12% of GOP voters and 15% of unaffiliateds agree. Seventy-nine percent (79%) of Republicans and 62% of unaffiliated voters think these comments make it more dangerous for the police to do their jobs, a view shared by only 44% of voters in President Obama’s party. 
 
 Seventy-seven percent (77%) of voters who say there is now a war on police believe the critical comments by some politicians make it more dangerous for the cops. Among those who don’t think there is a war on police going on, 35% say the comments improve police performance; 30% say it makes things more dangerous, while 28% think the comments have no impact. 
 
 Only 17% of all voters believe politicians raise racial issues to address real problems. Seventy percent (70%) think they talk race just to get elected. 
 
 Americans are skeptical of the protests that followed white-on-black police incidents in Ferguson and in Baltimore, Maryland. 
 
 Just 13% think most deaths that involve the police are the fault of the policeman. Seventy percent (70%) of voters believe the level of crime in low-income inner city communities is a bigger problem in America today than police discrimination against minorities

 They certainly aren’t the only ones. Here are some more examples of media outlets and politicians spreading the hysteria: 
 
 As I’ve noted here before, we’re seeing similar rhetoric from politicians, particularly from GOP presidential hopefuls, including Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Scott Walker. 
 
 All of this fact-free fearmongering is having an effect. A Rasmussen poll taken last week found that 58 percent of respondents now believe there is now a “war on police.” Just 27 percent disagreed. 
 
 So let’s go through the numbers. Again. So far, 2015 is on pace to see 35 felonious killings of police officers. If that pace holds, this year would end with the second lowest number of murdered cops in decades. Here’s a graph depicting annual killings of cops with firearms from Mark A. Perry at the American Enterprise Institute: 
 
 But these are just the raw numbers. If we look at the rate of killings of cops, the trend is more pronounced. There are two ways examine the rate of police killings. The first is to look at the rate of killings of cops per 100K cops on the street. This figure is somewhat difficult to calculate because there are widely varying estimates of how many cops are on the street. It depends on how you define “police officer,” who is doing the estimating, and various other factors. But if you use consistent sources, the number of police has generally gone up, while the number of officers killed has generally gone down. So your graph looks something like this one, from Dan Wang: 
 
 The other way you could measure the rate of killings of police officers is to look at the number with respect to the overall population. Here’s another graph from Perry that plots those figures: 
 
 As you can see, by this measure 2015 is shaping up to be the second safest year for police ever, after 2013. 
 
 Speaking of which, it’s important to note again here that 2013 was an abnormally and historically low year for police fatalities, as this graph from University of South Carolina law professor (and former police officer) Seth Stoughton shows. 
 
 @radleybalko More limited data set, but here are some relevant graphs. pic.twitter.com/jPCMPOhlL7 — Seth Stoughton (@PoliceLawProf) September 10, 2015 
 
 So when police advocates say that 2014 saw an 80+ percent increase in homicides of cops over 2013, remember a few things: First, 2013 wasn’t just an all-time low, it was an all-time low by a significant margin. Second, the 2013 figure was so low that even a small increase will look large when expressed as a percentage. Third, the figure for the following year, 2014, (51 officers killed) was essentially consistent with the average for the previous five years (50 killed), and still lower than any five-year average going back to 1960. (See this graph, also from Wang.) Fourth, again, 2015 is on pace (35 killings) to be lower than any year but 2013. Another common response from police organizations and their advocates is that the reduction in fatalities is due to better medical care and improvements in protective gear such as bulletproof vests. Both things are undoubtedly true. But assaults on police officers are in decline as well. That is, not only are fewer people killing police officers, fewer people are trying to harm them. These graphs from Stoughton show the raw numbers of assaults on police: 
 
 As you can see, at best you could argue that assaults on police with firearms are about even with where they’ve been for most of the last decade, save for a dip in 2009 and 2010. But these too are raw figures. When we look at the rate of assault on cops, from either the perspective of total cops or total population, the downward trend once again becomes more pronounced. From Daniel Bier, here are two graphs looking at the assault rates on police officers. 
 
 Any murder of a police officer is a tragedy. (As is any murder of a non-police officer.) But media outlets, politicians, and police advocates do real damage when they push this false narrative about a rising threat to law enforcement. First, this sort of propaganda weights the public debate and discourse. When there’s a fictional “war on cops” blaring in the background, it becomes much more difficult to have an honest discussion about police cameras, police militarization, use of lethal force policies, police discipline, police transparency, training, police accountability, and a host of other issues. Of course, that’s precisely the point. 
 
 But there’s also a much more pernicious effect of exaggerating the threats faced by law enforcement. When cops are constantly told that they’re under constant fire, or that every interaction with a citizen could be their last, or that they’re fortunate each time they come home from the job in one piece, it’s absolute poison for police-community relations. That kind of reminder on a regular basis would put anyone on edge. We’re putting police officers in a perpetually combative mindset that psychologically isolates them from the communities they serve. Incessantly telling cops that they’re under fire can condition them to see the people with whom they interact not as citizens with rights, but as potential threats. That not only means more animosity, anger and confrontation, it can also be a barrier to building relationships with people in the community — the sorts of relationships that help police officers solve crimes and keep communities safe. 
 
 It also just makes for a miserable work life. If you’ve been trained to think your job is getting progressively more dangerous, and that a significant percentage of the people you encounter on a daily basis want to do you harm, you’re going to be less tolerant of dissent. You’re going to constantly be on-guard, on-edge, and jumpy. That isn’t a state of mind that’s conducive to de-escalation, that opts for persuasion over brute force, or seeks out peaceful conflict resolution. It’s a state of mind ruled by the limbic system, not the frontal lobe. And yes, it’s a state of mind that makes an officer more likely to reach for his gun. Again, this isn’t a comment on cops. It’s a comment on human beings in general. 
 
 An over-emphasis on and obsession with a “war on cops” would be dangerous and counterproductive even if it were true. But by every imaginable measure, it just isn’t true. When this false narrative comes from police organizations and their supporters, it’s at least somewhat understandable. When it comes from politicians, it’s grandstanding and demagoguery. When it comes from media organizations, it’s journalistic malpractice. And it’s almost certainly getting people killed. 
 
 One last point: I’ve seen some police officials and their advocates respond to these statistics by pointing out that even if assaults and killings of cops are down, anti-police rhetoric is increasing. Therefore, they say, they’re justified in proclaiming that there’s a war on the police. This is nonsense. Police agencies are government agencies. They’re government agencies in whom we entrust the power to detain, arrest, and kill. Yes, it’s true that some people are demanding more of those agencies. It’s true that personal technology is enabling people to create an independent video narrative of their interactions with police. It’s true that those videos have sometimes revealed police misconduct and brutality, and that police officers, like all people, sometimes mis-remember, misstate, and outright lie when recounting contentious, traumatic, high-stakes incidents. And it’s true that because of all of this, the public as a whole today finds police officers as a whole less trustworthy than in the past. It’s also true that some activists, pundits, and politicians are demanding more accountability, transparency, and training for police. 
 
 None of these things are indicative of a “war.” On the contrary, all of this new skepticism, criticism, forced transparency, and mistrust of the police is — again — coming even as violence against police officers is reaching historic lows. This is how a democracy is supposed to work. It’s something worth celebrating. 
 
 Instead, police groups and their advocates are claiming that the mere act of criticizing a government entity is akin to declaring war on it, and that therefore, police critics are culpable every time a police officer is murdered. (And given the way they ignore and abuse statistics, those critics are also apparently culpable for a lot of murders that never happened.) They’re essentially saying that exercising constitutional rights and participating in democracy are in and of themselves acts of violence. And in many cases, this is coming from the very people that the government empowers to use actual violence. 
 
 That is something worth worrying about.","– A recent Rasmussen poll found 58% of respondents believe a ""war on police"" exists. The sentiment is being echoed publicly: After Shannon J. Miles was arrested for killing Sheriff Deputy Darren Goforth at a gas station in Houston, a local DA remarked that ""there are a few bad apples in every profession. That does not mean there should be open warfare declared on law enforcement."" NPR reports some people are using this stat as evidence of that war: In 2013, 27 US officers were ""feloniously killed""; a year later, the number was 51. But Seth Stoughton, a former cop and assistant law professor, says this so-called war is, in fact, imaginary. ""It's misleading to compare one year to another year,"" says Stoughton. ""2013 was the safest year for police officers, ever,"" as in, ""the safest year in recorded history."" The number of police deaths last year was on par with 2012 and significantly lower than in 2011. We're now on track to have 35 felonious police deaths this year, which would be the second-lowest number in decades after 2013, writes Radley Balko at the Washington Post. The number of officers murdered has dropped by 50% compared to the 1970s, Stoughton says, and while things like improved protective gear play a role in that, assaults on officers are also down. More ambush killings, like the one in Houston, may be occurring, but ""the increase from five to eight, or five to 10"" over 67 million police-citizen interactions every year, ""statistically, it doesn't look significant,"" Stoughton says.",<pad> The number of police officers murdered in 2014 was a jump from the 27 killed in 2013 and many took it as a sign of greater danger for police.</s>,0.15165876554075608,0.03558718670482906,0.1327014195691921

 Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown is under investigation for an alleged assault in a West Hollywood parking lot, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said early Monday. 
 
 Deputies responding to a report of six men fighting Sunday night found the scene clear, but were told by witnesses that there had been a brief fight over a parking space. 
 
 ""The altercation allegedly led to Chris Brown punching the victim,"" the department said in a statement released early Monday morning. 
 
 The ""victim"" wasn't identified but the celebrity website TMZ _ which first reported the fight outside the Westlake Recording Studio _ said it also involved Frank Ocean, one of the top nominees at Grammy Awards next month. 
 
 In a Twitter posting later, Ocean said he ""got jumped by (Brown) and a couple guys"" and suffered a finger cut. 
 
 It wasn't Brown's first problem in the run-up to the Grammys. His attack on singer Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 awards event overshadowed the show. 
 
 Last June, he was injured in a brawl with members of hip-hop star Drake's entourage at a New York nightclub. 
 
 No arrests were made. Brown was gone by the time deputies arrived but the department said the investigation is ongoing and Brown would be contacted later. 
 
 Email messages to Ocean's publicist and Brown's lawyer were not immediately returned. A man answering the phone at the recording studio declined to comment. ||||| Chris Brown is at it again. 
 
 The hotheaded musician is under investigation for assault after brawling with R&B singer Frank Ocean outside of a Los Angeles recording studio Sunday night, officials said. 
 
 Witnesses told investigating deputies that the fight was over a parking space – and that Brown threw the first punch. 
 
 Those statements conflict with initial reports of the fight, with other witnesses telling TMZ that someone attacked Chris as he tried to shake Ocean’s hand. 
 
 Ocean, who cut his finger in the fight, took to Twitter following the melee: “got jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. i only wish everest was there,” he wrote. Everest is the name of the singer’s Bernese mountain dog. 
 
 He also hinted that the injury could impact his performance at the Grammys. 
 
 The pair had previously battled online in 2011, back before Brown deactivated his Twitter account. 
 
 Last June, Brown and hip-hop star Drake were involved in a bottle-throwing melee at the Manhattan club W.i.P. Brown received a gash on his chin during that fight. 
 
 That club fight was reportedly over Rihanna, the longtime girlfriend Brown attacked in 2009. 
 
 In terms of this weekend’s fight, deputies are continuing to investigate, and they hope to talk to Brown. No charges have been filed at this time. 
 
 With AP","– Chris Brown may be in trouble with the law again: Police say he punched someone last night in a fight over a parking space, the AP reports.

 A bag used by US astronaut Neil Armstrong to collect the first ever samples of the Moon has sold at auction in New York for $1.8m (£1.4m). 
 
 The outer decontamination bag from the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 was bought at Sotheby's by an anonymous bidder. 
 
 The white bag still carries traces of Moon dust and small rocks. 
 
 The auction comes after a legal battle over the ownership of the only artefact from the Apollo 11 mission which was in private hands. 
 
 After the spacecraft returned to Earth, nearly all the equipment was sent to the Smithsonian museums. 
 
 However, the bag was left in a box at the Johnson Space Center because of an inventory error. 
 
 It was then misidentified during a government auction, selling for just $995 to a lawyer from Illinois in 2015. 
 
 Nasa later tried to get the bag back, but earlier this year a federal judge ruled that it legally belonged to the buyer, who then offered it for sale at Sotheby's. ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — A bag containing traces of moon dust sold for $1.8 million at an auction on Thursday following a galactic court battle. 
 
 The collection bag, used by astronaut Neil Armstrong during the first manned mission to the moon in 1969, was sold at a Sotheby's auction of items related to space voyages. The buyer declined to be identified. The pre-sale estimate was $2 million to $4 million. 
 
 The artifact from the Apollo 11 mission had been misidentified and sold at an online government auction, and NASA had fought to get it back. But in December a federal judge ruled that it legally belonged to a Chicago-area woman who bought it in 2015 for $995. 
 
 Sotheby's declined to identify the seller. However, details of the 2015 purchase were made public during the court case. 
 
 Investigators unknowingly hit the moon mother lode in 2003 while searching the garage of a man later convicted of stealing and selling museum artifacts, including some that were on loan from NASA. 
 
 The 12-by-8½-inch (30-by-20-centimeter) bag was misidentified and sold at an online government auction. 
 
 Nancy Carlson, of Inverness, Illinois, got an ordinary-looking bag made of white Beta cloth and polyester with rubberized nylon and a brass zipper. 
 
 Carlson, a collector, knew the bag had been used in a space flight, but she didn't know which one. She sent it to NASA for testing, and the government agency, discovering its importance, fought to keep it. 
 
 The artifact ""belongs to the American people,"" NASA said then. 
 
 U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten, in Wichita, Kansas, said that while it shouldn't have gone up for auction he didn't have the authority to reverse the sale. He ordered the government to return it. 
 
 The judge said the importance and desirability of the bag stemmed solely from the efforts of NASA employees whose ""amazing technical achievements, skill and courage in landing astronauts on the moon and returning them safely have not been replicated in the almost half a century since the Apollo 11 landing."" 
 
 When it comes to moon landings, Thursday's auction is far from the final frontier. 
 
 A group called For All Moonkind Inc. mentioned the moon bag this week while campaigning for ""measures to preserve and protect the six Apollo lunar landing sites."" It plans to take up the issue next month at the Starship Congress 2017 in California. 
 
 Also getting out-of-this-world interest at the auction was the Flown Apollo 13 Flight Plan, with handwritten notations by all three crew members.

 U.S. customers will continue to go to Netflix.com for streaming and DVD-by-mail rentals, the company said in a statement issued on Monday. 
 
 The earlier plan to put movie and television DVD rentals on a different website, which never went into effect, was one of several missteps in recent months that have helped drive shares of the one-time Wall Street darling down about 60 percent since July. 
 
 Writing on the company blog last month, CEO Reed Hastings said Netflix was putting the DVD service on a different website and naming it Qwikster as the company separated the business from its growing online streaming offerings. 
 
 The move would have forced customers of both streaming and DVD options to visit different websites and maintain different accounts for each subscription. Customers also would have received separate credit-card charges. 
 
 The announcement prompted confusion and outrage from customers who wrote on the Netflix blog and Facebook page, plus bewilderment over the move to the Qwikster name for DVDs sent through the mail in the company's signature red envelopes. 
 
 In a statement issued on Monday, Hastings said ""there is a difference between moving quickly -- which Netflix has done very well for years -- and moving too fast, which is what we did in this case."" 
 
 ""Consumers value the simplicity Netflix has always offered and we respect that,"" Hastings also said. 
 
 Netflix said it will not rename the DVD service. U.S. members ""will continue to use one website, one account and one password for their movie and TV watching enjoyment under the Netflix brand,"" the company's statement said. 
 
 The move comes as Netflix deals with a customer backlash that began in July when the company announced it was raising prices by as much as 60 percent, or $6 a month, for some customers who wanted to keep DVD and streaming subscriptions. 
 
 With cancellations rolling in, Netflix cut its third-quarter forecast by 1 million subscribers in September. The company said it expects to have 24 million subscribers at the quarter's end. 
 
 Hastings later apologized for the handling of the price increase but is sticking with that decision as the company works to build its online movie and television streaming service. 
 
 Netflix faces pressure from Hollywood studios and cable programmers to pay more for streaming content. Negotiations with Liberty Media's Starz were recently called off because the two sides could not reach an agreement on pricing terms. 
 
 The company also faces competition from Amazon.com , Hulu and others. ||||| At Netflix, we are constantly asking ourselves what can we do to make it even easier for our members to spend less time browsing and more time discovering stories they will love.

 Even by the low standards of this season, this cold open felt rushed. People across the political spectrum have criticized Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of Trump, but at least he’s playing a character. De Niro’s Mueller is all awkward delivery and self-satisfied mugging. 
 
 Self-described “SNL super-nerd-dork” Jason Momoa hosts for the first time. Singing, dancing and flexing, the once-and-future Aquaman’s monologue promises a …spirited performance.

One of them, Scrabby (Momoa), begs for a new child to watch over now his has turned 13 and “figured out he could do something with his body”. It’s a one-note joke spread thin, but Momoa’s weary performance and some clever innuendo make it work.

 Weekend Update runs down the latest about the Mueller investigation (newly titled Trump: Endgame), the president’s daft tweets (“I don’t blame Trump for thinking his tweets have magical power – just this week his tweets about China were able to tank the entire stock market”) and his tapping of William Barr as attorney general. “A reboot of someone with the last name Barr who was big in the early 90s? What could go wrong?” 
 
 Jost and Che welcome their first guest: awkward pre-teen Cary Krum (Aidy Bryant), who gives travel advice centered around her own vacation. It’s a bubbly, endearing performance that showcases Bryant’s innate likeability. Che holds court for the second guest feature, extolling the virtues of bidets much to the disgust of his co-host. Essentially a two-minute stand-up, it’s the most energized we’ve seen the Update anchor/co-head writer this season. 
 
 A Christmas Carol has Momoa playing an “extra” spirit who visits the newly penitent Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. Mincing it up to an awkward degree, Momoa performs a Magic Mike-like dance for the confused miser, showing off his physique and earning hoots and hollers in lieu of laughs. 
 
 Facebook Twitter Pinterest The monologue. 
 
 Day of the Dorks is a parody of Revenge of the Nerds, with Momoa in the much-memed Ogre role. It starts out as an interesting deconstruction of this character – his fellow frat brothers grow concerned over his unhinged ferocity as well as his tendency towards violence – but it quickly jettisons any point in favor of letting Momoa break stuff. 
 
 Mumford and Sons return to perform Delta. Then Sleigh Ride is a manic sketch that mashes together bizarre characters: Thompson and Jones as a couple with wildly different ideas about their relationship status, Momoa as a horny zip-line instructor, Cecily Strong as a mush-mouthed British singer with a new vagina (you’re guess is as good as mine), and Day as an asexual sleigh driver. Unsurprisingly, it never coalesces into coherence. 
 
 The last sketch is a welcomely twisted spin on Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, with Pete Davidson in the title role. He uses his newfound cachet to lay into his former bullies, making one of the other reindeers suck his glowing appendage before having Santa put him down with a shotgun. It’s a good bookend with the Elves on the Shelves sketch, even if everything in between has left us wanting. 
 
 Over the last few weeks, SNL has shown itself adept at slapstick, so it’s disappointing it wasn’t able to make better use of Momoa’s physicality. Even more disappointing is the inability to produce a memorable sketch from a heavy news week. Hopefully, next week’s episode will right the ship. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

 As Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election drew closer to President Donald Trump, ""Saturday Night Live"" stayed close to the headlines Saturday with a cold open that featured Robert De Niro as the special counsel. 
 
 Eric Trump, played by Alex Moffat, was in a children's bed and Donald Trump, Jr., played by Mikey Day, was at his side preparing to read a bedtime story when his younger brother alerted to a sound coming from his closet.

 But it turned out De Niro's Mueller was hiding in the closet. 
 
 ""It’s just me, Robert Mueller — your dad’s friend from work,"" he said after Trump Jr. left.

 Later, ""SNL"" imagined what it would be like if the producers of Fox's ""Empire"" made a show about a black President Trump and his African-American family — ""Them Trumps.""

 He returned to claim victory because, Trump said, a sitting president can't be indicted. 
 
 ""And even though I'm black ...,"" he said before being cut off again by a man in a suit. 
 
 ""You've been impeached,"" the man said. 
 
 ""Yeah,"" black Trump said, ""I was waiting on that."" 
 
 The president's troubles with the special counsel were revisited on the ""Weekend Update"" news segment hosted by Michael Che and Colin Jost. 
 
 Jost noted that a person identified as Individual 1 in Mueller's charging document against Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, appeared to be Trump. 
 
 ""Now we don’t know for sure who Individual 1 is,"" he said. ""Let’s just say things are getting tense right now over at Individual 1 Tower."" 
 
 Che thought Trump's response to Mueller's forthcoming report on his investigation — releasing a ""counter report"" — was hilarious. 
 
 ""Well, you better hurry up buddy because you only get one hour a day on the prison computer,"" he said. 
 
 Jost said it was amazing that outgoing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly served for decades in the military but ""he couldn't finish one tour with Donald Trump."" 
 
 Jost said the retired U.S. Marine Corps general was leaving ""because Kelly requires extensive surgery to remove his palm from his face.""

260,"Ever since health care reform flamed out in the 1990s, Democrats thought lots of things might derail their longtime dream this time around. Losing a Senate seat in liberal Massachusetts was not on the list. 
 
 But that is the harsh reality sinking in among Democrats — that a Republican victory Tuesday could spell the end of health reform because there is no good option to rescue the plan from this latest brush with political death. 
 
 Publicly, the White House and top Democrats held firm to their stance that health care reform will pass this year. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Monday that Democrats will need to figure out a way to proceed if Republican Scott Brown wins, “but that doesn’t mean we won’t have a health care bill.” 
 
 “Let’s remove all doubt that we will have health care one way or another,” Pelosi told reporters in San Francisco. 
 
 But privately, Democrats are getting cold feet about pushing ahead full bore on health care. Moderate Democrats who have long been skeptical of the administration’s focus on the issue could begin to peel away in the face of a convincing loss for Democrat Martha Coakley, dealing a fatal blow to legislation that had no room for error in either chamber. 
 
 Democrats have options to salvage reform following a Brown victory, but all have serious deficiencies. 
 
 One idea that looked promising a week ago — passing a bill through the House and Senate before Brown was seated — has dropped down the list of alternatives, as Democrats fear it would look like a partisan power play that ignored the will of Massachusetts voters. 
 
 The White House-favored option is to ask the House to adopt the Senate bill, with a promise to make additional changes later through the budget reconciliation process. But House Democratic liberals, as well as some conservatives, don’t like key parts of the Senate bill and don’t want to make it their own. 
 
 Ron Pollack, a longtime health care insider and executive director of Families USA, has floated a variation on this theme with the administration and congressional aides: a two-step process that would reassure House members their wishes would be met in the bill. 
 
 Under Pollack’s proposal, the House would take up the Senate bill only after the White House and congressional leaders struck a deal on key issues, such as taxes and the subsidies to purchase insurance. They would incorporate those changes into a separate budget reconciliation bill. 
 
 The House would pass both the Senate bill and the reconciliation bill, possibly on the same day. The Senate would then take up the reconciliation bill, which would require only 51 votes for passage. 
 
 “It is eminently doable — and quickly,” Pollack said Monday. “It is the combination of two things that wouldn’t work separately but, when done in tandem, make a lot of sense.” 
 
 This approach, however, would prevent any fixes that did not have a direct impact on the federal budget, such as changes to language on abortion and immigration and, possibly, even the insurance exchanges. The exchange question could be particularly problematic for House Democrats who have sacrificed the public option in return for the national insurance exchanges under the House bill. 
 
 “Progressives and conservatives in the caucus won’t go for it,” one aide predicted Monday. But they may not have a choice. Another aide acknowledged a Brown win would force party leaders to recalibrate and said that Obama and Pelosi would have to convince a skeptical rank and file that this was the only course of action. ||||| Democrat Martha Coakley's struggle to stave off a potentially devastating defeat in Tuesday's special Senate election in Massachusetts marks a critical turning point in the year-long debate about health-care reform. Regardless of the outcome of the race, the two parties appeared headed toward a monumental clash over the issue in the coming midterm elections. 
 
 A victory by state Sen. Scott Brown, who was given little chance of winning only a few weeks ago, would give Republicans 41 votes in the Senate and further embolden them to challenge the core of President Obama's agenda. Democrats could face an internal battle over how or even whether to proceed with the legislation, as well as how to deal with the issue in the fall races. 
 
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to head off possible talk of retreat, vowing to press ahead with the legislation. ""There is no 'back to the drawing board,' "" she told reporters Monday in San Francisco. She said there will be a final health-care bill ""one way or the other."" 
 
 But Republicans were warning of a political backlash if Democrats proceed in the face of a Brown victory. 
 
 Obama did not directly mention health-care reform when he campaigned Sunday on behalf of Coakley, the state attorney general, who is running to fill the seat of the late Edward M. Kennedy. Even before the polls opened, White House officials sought to blunt the narrative that the race was a referendum on the president's health-care initiative, in part by arguing that Massachusetts already has universal coverage. 
 
 ""Massachusetts is completely unique, because the health reform law passed a few years ago,"" White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said. ""It makes it an imperfect example and impossible to extrapolate."" 
 
 Other Democrats argued that Coakley, rather than health-care reform or Obama, bears principal responsibility for allowing the race to become so close, noting that in many of their private polls in the state, both the president and his initiative are more popular than the attorney general. 
 
 Republicans scoffed at the assertion that health-care reform has not been a driving force, noting that Brown has campaigned hard on the message that he would be the 41st vote against the legislation in the Senate and that the anger and discontent about Obama's agenda has helped fuel the Republican's rise in the polls. 
 
 ""Health care has transcended issue status,"" GOP strategist Mary Matalin said. ""It now represents something quite irregular in American politics: The obsession of a liberal minority thwarting the will of an intense supermajority for the better part of a year now."" 
 
 More oppose reform 
 
 
 
 A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 44 percent of Americans support the proposed changes in the health-care system being debated in Congress, while 51 percent oppose them. Opposition is more intense than support, with 39 percent saying they strongly oppose the legislation and 22 percent saying they strongly favor it. 
 
 Fifty-three percent said the changes would mean higher personal costs, and 50 percent said the quality of their health care would be better if the measure did not pass. Fifty-six percent said the overall cost of the initiative nationally would be higher under the plan advanced by the president and the Democrats. 
 
 Congressional negotiators agreed last week to tax high-cost health plans, as the Senate bill proposes, rather than raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. The public, however, favors raising taxes on the rich by 58 percent to 22 percent. Americans are closely divided over whether those covered by a government-sponsored insurance option should be allowed to buy coverage for abortions.","– With polls showing the majority of Americans opposed to the Democrats' health care reform bill, a victory for Scott Brown in Massachusetts today could sound the death of the party's yearlong effort at health reform. If Dems try to proceed with the reforms in the wake of a Brown victory, the GOP will have a strong case that a liberal minority is ignoring the will of voters to push its own agenda, the Washington Post reports. Democrats are rehearsing options for salvaging reform in the face of a Brown victory—a quick-fix House-Senate reconciliation bill, for example—but all of these either would spark serious turmoil within the party or have other major deficiencies, Politico reports. Dem leaders are putting on a brave face, but privately they're confronting the difficult-to-fathom possibility that a Senate loss in liberal Massachusetts may be what sinks health reform this time around.",<pad> House bill.</s>,0.0,0.0,0.0

Their lives, and motives, remain mysteries to investigators, who are looking at possible ties to international terrorism but have not ruled out the possibility that this was the bloody culmination of a workplace dispute. 
 
 Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik were observant Muslims, described by friends as quiet and unobtrusive. Mr. Farook, 28, who was a lanky six feet tall and had a full beard for long periods of his life, graduated from California State University, San Bernardino, with a degree in environmental engineering. He worked for the San Bernardino County health department, checking food surfaces at restaurants and bakeries and chlorine levels in public swimming pools.

 Far less is publicly known about Ms. Malik, 29, who lived with Mr. Farook and his mother in Redlands, about five miles from where the attack took place. Mr. Farook brought her to the United States in July 2014, with a Pakistani passport and a K-1 visa, which designated her his fiancée. He applied for a permanent resident green card for her in September 2014, and she was granted a conditional card last July after passing a background check. 
 
 In registering for one of two dating services he used, Mr. Farook said he spoke Urdu, though friends said the couple spoke to each other in English. Mr. Farook, in a posting on one of the dating services, said he was open to dating a woman of any faith but was looking for “someone who takes her religion very seriously and is always trying to improve her religion.” ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — A heavily armed couple dressed in battle gear opened fire on a holiday banquet Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously wounding more than a dozen others, later dying in a shootout with police. Here's what's known about the two suspects:

 WHAT PROMPTED THE GUNFIRE? 
 
 Police do not have a motive for the shootings, which ended with a gun battle on a San Bernardino street that left 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook and 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik dead. Authorities say they were the only two shooters, and relatives said the two were married. Investigators have not ruled out a link with terrorism and are also looking into the possibility that a workplace dispute triggered the massacre at a social services center for the disabled. 
 
 ___ 
 
 HOW DID THE SUSPECTS MEET? 
 
 Farook traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year and returned with a wife, said co-worker Patrick Baccari, who attended the holiday party Wednesday but was in the bathroom when the shooting started. Baccari says Farook was gone for about a month in the spring, and when he returned word got around Farook had been married. The woman he described as a pharmacist joined him in the U.S. shortly afterward, and they soon had a baby. Police described Malik as Farook's wife or fiancee. 
 
 ___ 
 
 HOW DID IT HAPPEN? 
 
 Baccari, who was sitting at the same table as Farook, said employees at the holiday party were taking a break before snapping group photos when Farook suddenly disappeared, leaving a jacket draped over his chair. Baccari stepped out to the bathroom when he heard explosions. 
 
 ""I'm getting pelted by shrapnel coming through the walls,"" he said. ""We hit the ground."" 
 
 The shooting lasted about five minutes, he said, and when he looked in the mirror he realized he was bleeding. He was hit by fragments in the body, face and arms. 
 
 ""If I hadn't been in the bathroom, I'd probably be laying dead on the floor,"" he said. 
 
 ___ 
 
 HOW DID THE FAMILY REACT? 
 
 The suspects Farook and Malik left their 6-month-old baby girl with Farook's mother early Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor's appointment, said Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Ayloush based his comments on conversations he had with Syed Rizwan Farook's brother-in-law Farhan Khan, who appeared at a news conference late Wednesday as a family representative. 
 
 The young parents did not return to get their daughter for several hours, however, and their family became worried when they could not reach them after seeing reports on the news about the shooting. The family at first was concerned that Farook might be a victim of the shooting because they knew he worked as an environmental inspector at the county's health department and sometimes worked at the Inland Regional Center, Ayloush said. 
 
 The family only began to piece together the events around 2 p.m. — three hours after the shooting — when a reporter called with questions, Ayloush said. Family members were being questioned by police late Wednesday. 
 
 ""We don't know the motives. Is it work, race-related, is it mental illness, is it extreme ideology? At this point, it's really unknown to us and at this point it's too soon to speculate,"" Ayloush said.

 WHAT DID FAROOK'S CO-WORKERS THINK OF HIM? 
 
 Baccari said his co-worker, who said he was raised on a farm with goats and chickens, was reserved. Several months ago Farook grew out his beard. He appeared committed to his family, and never displayed any unusual behavior or discussed any radical political views. ||||| SAN BERNARDINO, Calif.

 Authorities were trying to determine a motive, which could include workplace violence or terrorism. 
 
 Wednesday's shooting happened at a social services center for the disabled where the suspect's colleagues with the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health were renting space for a celebration. It was the nation's deadliest mass shooting since the attack at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead. 
 
 San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan identified one dead suspect as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, the other as Tashfeen Malik, 27, his wife or fiancee. Burguan said Farook was born in the United States; the chief said he did not know Malik's background. 
 
 The attackers invaded the Inland Regional Center about 60 miles east of Los Angeles around 11 a.m., opening fire in a conference area where county health officials were having an employee banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the nonprofit center. 
 
 ""They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission,"" Burguan said. 
 
 Farook attended the event before leaving — and returning to kill. 
 
 Co-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook, who suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari said when the shooting started, he sought refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. 
 
 Baccari described Farook as reserved and said he showed no signs of unusual behavior. Earlier this year he traveled to Saudi Arabia and returned with a wife, later growing a beard, Baccari said. 
 
 The FBI is investigating several possible motives, including workplace violence and terrorism, according to David Bowdich, assistant director of the bureau's Los Angeles office. He did not elaborate. 
 
 Farook was a restaurant inspector for the health department, according to public records. Police chief Burguan said he had been a county employee for five years. 
 
 The couple dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with relatives Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor's appointment, Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said after talking with family. Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook's sister, told reporters he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. He said he was in shock, condemned the violence, and had ""absolutely no idea why he would do this."" 
 
 About four hours after the morning carnage, police hunting for the killers riddled a black SUV with gunfire in a shootout 2 miles from the social services center in this Southern California city of 214,000 people. Farook and Malik were found with assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns, and were wearing ""assault-style clothing"" with ammunition attached, authorities said. 
 
 Television news helicopters captured the aftermath, as officers slowly approached the mangled SUV. 
 
 In the morning, as the day's first bursts of gunfire echoed through the large three-building complex, some people locked themselves in offices, desperately waiting for police and texting or making hushed phone calls to loved ones. 
 
 ""People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office,"" Terry Petit's daughter, who works at the center, texted him. 
 
 Petit choked back tears as he read his daughter's words for reporters outside the center, where social workers find jobs, housing and transportation and provide other services to people with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. 
 
 Olivia Navarro said her daughter, Jamile Navarro, a case manager at the social service center, called her and whispered that she was hiding in a locked room. 
 
 ""I said, 'All right, I'll be there, turn off the lights, don't make a sound,'"" Navarro said. ""And that was it."" 
 
 Her daughter survived. 
 
 That the violence happened at a place dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities — even if they were not targeted — made it even harder for some to comprehend. 
 
 ""These are all disabled kids, very disabled,"" said Sherry Esquerra, who was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. ""She gets all the services she possibly could for these kids. So I just don't understand why somebody would come in and start shooting."" 
 
 According to its web page, the center has a client base of more than 30,000 people and their families. It is a privately run nonprofit, the largest of its kind in California with about 670 employees. 
 
 FBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attackers. Triage units were set up outside, and people were wheeled away on stretchers. 
 
 Seventeen people were wounded, according to authorities. Ten were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said. 
 
 Others were marched from the building, hands raised so police could search them and make sure the attackers weren't trying to slip out. 
 
 They had indeed escaped. One witness, Glenn Willwerth, who runs a business across the street, said he heard 10 to 15 shots and then saw an SUV with tinted windows pull out ""very calmly, very slowly"" and drive off. 
 
 As the manhunt dragged on, stores, office buildings and schools were locked down in the city, and roads blocked off. 
 
 With police looking for a dark SUV, officers staking out a home in the nearby city of Redlands saw a vehicle matching that description. Public records show the home is a possible residence of a family member of Farook. 
 
 Authorities pursued the SUV, and a gunbattle erupted around 3 p.m. One officer among nearly two dozen involved in the shootout suffered a minor injury. 
 
 A fake bomb — a metal pipe stuffed with cloth — was thrown from the SUV during the chase, said Agent Meredith Davis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
 
 Three explosive devices — thought to be real and all connected to one another — were found at the social service center and later detonated by a bomb squad, police said. 
 
 A third person who was spotted running near the gunbattle was detained, but Burguan said it was unclear if that person had anything to do with the crime. At a late-night news conference, Burguan also said that early witness accounts of three shooters were probably wrong: ""We are reasonably confident at this point that we have two shooters and we have two dead suspects."" 
 
 President Barack Obama urged the country to take steps to reduce mass shootings, including stricter gun laws and stronger background checks. 
 
 ""The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world,"" Obama told CBS. 
 
 Federal authorities said that the two assault rifles and two handguns used in the violence were purchased legally, but they haven't said how and when they got into the hands of the two shooters. 
 
 The social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, a member of its board of trustees. However, the conference room that hosts public events such as Wednesday's banquet is usually left open when visitors are expected.

 The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has already spotted about 20 nutrias in Fresno, Merced and Stanislaus counties. 
 
 Several months ago, officials with San Joaquin County had a report of a possible sighting of nutria. They didn’t find anything, but with these latest sightings – it’s causing concern. 
 
 Officials with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. It’s a nutria, which they say is larger than a muskrat and smaller than a beaver, and an appetite for destruction. 
 
 “For us primarily, the issue would be the infrastructure because if we get flooding or if we can’t pump water off and can’t maintain those levees then, of course, it’s going to be difficult to farm in those areas,” said Tim Pelican, agriculture commissioner of San Joaquin County. 
 
 The rodent eats so much vegetation that it threatens wetlands and there could also be the loss of agriculture crops and levees. The animals have been sighted in three Central Valley counties and could make its way into the delta in San Joaquin County. 
 
 “Usually, somebody brings something like that into the area; it escaped, it doesn’t have any natural predators and then it begins to re-populate. These rodents have a lot of offspring’s every year,” he said. 
 
 Fish and wildlife officials are trying to eradicate the rodents and have set up a multi-agency task force to come up with a plan to deal with them. 
 
 “We’re all right now getting together trying to come up with a plan and just determine the extent of the problem and infestation, and we’re in the process of putting out traps and cameras to get a sense of where they are and how many there are,” said Peter Tira, California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
 
 This is the first of its population, the state has seen since the 1970s. Officials are turning to the public for help in reporting any sightings before things get out of hand. 
 
 “They wreck agriculture crops, they are rodents; they carry diseases, they can pass disease onto livestock on people, and their pets,” he adds. 
 
 Traps have been set up in various parts of Fresno, Merced and Stanislaus counties. ||||| In this photo taken on Dec. 13, 2013, a family of young nutria nibble the grass along the shores of Capitol Lake in Olympia, Wash.

Tony Overman AP ||||| A giant invasive rodent with the ability to destroy roads, levees and wetlands has been discovered in Stanislaus County. 
 
 Weighing in at 20 pounds and measuring 2 feet, 6 inches long, plus a 12-inch tail, the nutria live in or near water. They're also incredibly destructive.

 “They burrow in dikes, and levees, and road beds, so they weaken infrastructure, (which is) problematic for flood control systems,” California Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Peter Tira said. 
 
 When nutria aren’t burrowing, they’re eating. They can consume 25 percent of their body weight each day in vegetation, but they waste and destroy 10 times that.

 Since 2017, more than 20 nutria have been spotted in Stanislaus, Merced and Fresno counties. However, that number could explode if they aren't dealt with quickly. Nutria can give birth to up to 200 offspring each year.

 “We have traps out. We’re setting traps. We have trail cameras,"" Tira said. ""We’re really asking for the public's help to report sightings so we can get a handle on the extent of the problem.""

 Nutria are native to South America, and they were introduced to California in 1899 for their mink-like fur. 
 
 Wildlife officials believed they were eradicated from the state in 1978 but now think a colony may have stayed under the radar and only recently reemerged.

 Nutria is often mistaken for a beaver or muskrat, but it's identified by its white whiskers, rounded tail and webbed feet with just one toe free. 
 
 AlertMe","– California is under attack from a giant, big-eating, fast-breeding, road-destroying rodent believed to have been eradicated from the state 40 years ago, KCRA reports. According to the Sacramento Bee, state biologists have found nearly two-dozen nutria in Stanislaus, Merced, and Fresno counties since March. The rodents were introduced to California in 1899 for their fur, but officials thought they got rid of the last of them in 1978. It's unclear where this new population of nutria came from—it's possible one colony escaped eradication only to emerge recently—but officials say their numbers will explode if something isn't done. A single female nutria can give birth to up to 200 offspring a year, and they have no natural predators. Nutria are 2.5-feet-long, weigh around 20 pounds, and can eat up to 25% of their body weight a day. ""They burrow in dikes, and levees, and road beds, so they weaken infrastructure, (which is) problematic for flood control systems,” California Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Peter Tira tells KCRA. Wetlands and levees in the areas where the nutria have been found are needed for flood control and providing water to cities and farms in Southern California. ""The issue would be the infrastructure because if we get flooding or if we can’t pump water off and can’t maintain those levees then, of course, it’s going to be difficult to farm in those areas,” Tim Pelican, agriculture commissioner of San Joaquin County, tells CBS Sacramento. Officials are setting traps for the rodents and asking residents to report sightings.","<pad> California Department of Fish and Wildlife has already spotted about 20 nutrias in Fresno, Merced and Stanislaus counties.</s>",0.08247422503719846,0.014981272086296741,0.08247422503719846

 The figures are a clear sign that the economy is picking up after a brutal winter slowed growth. 
 
 The Labor Department says the unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent in March. But the drop occurred because the number of people working or seeking work fell sharply. People not seeking work aren't counted as unemployed. 
 
 Employers also added more jobs in February and March than previously estimated. The job totals for those two months were revised up by a combined 36,000.

Those 288,000 jobs mark the fastest job growth pace in more than two years—and as for the 6.3% unemployment rate, that's the lowest in five-and-a-half years, the AP reports.

 Slovenian police say a group of about 150 refugees who have arrived from Croatia on an international train bound for Zurich will be returned to Croatia. 
 
 The refugees arrived at the Dobova train station, which serves as the main rail border crossing between Slovenia and Croatia, Thursday evening. They were transferred to three cars which will take them back to Croatia, according to Slovenia's state news agency. 
 
 Meanwhile, Croatia's Interior Minister says his country could close down its borders if faced with thousands more migrants and refugees coming in from Serbia as has been the case in the past two days.

 Some of the migrants from Croatia also have set out on foot toward Slovenia's border, some 30 kilometers (18 miles) away.

 Hungary's foreign minister says the ""state of crisis"" declared earlier in some areas due to the large flow of migrants has been extended to a pair of southern counties as migrants have begun entering from Croatia. 
 
 Peter Szijjarto said Thursday that emergency measure giving authorities extra powers like greater leeway in the use of public buildings and the right to block roads would be extended to Baranya and Somogy counties, which border Croatia. 
 
 Szijjarto said Croatian officials had ""lost control"" over the migrant flow there after Hungary's clampdown on its border with Serbia forced migrants to find new routes to Germany and Western Europe. 
 
 Szijjarto said it was ""unacceptable"" that Croatia was pushing migrants toward Hungary and Slovenia instead of registering and looking after them according to European Union rules.

 Germany's vice chancellor is making a new appeal to other European countries to help shoulder the burden of the influx of migrants. 
 
 Germany has made little progress so far in persuading many countries in the European Union to agree to a mandatory redistribution of refugees. Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said in a video message that Europe needs to move: ""Germany is helping. The question is, who is helping Germany?"" 
 
 Gabriel said the impression has arisen that ""Europe is something people join in with when there's money and where they hide in the bushes when they have to take responsibility."" He added that ""money cannot keep on flowing in Europe as it has so far if Germany, Austria and Sweden organize and finance taking in refugees alone.""

 European Union lawmakers have backed an EU plan to distribute 120,000 refugees among member countries in a fast-track measure aimed at relieving migration pressure on Greece, Italy and Hungary. 
 
 The move in the European Parliament means that EU interior ministers meeting in Brussels next Tuesday will be able to approve the plan if they can overcome opposition from a group of Eastern European nations. ||||| LONDON — Migrants streaming into Europe have braved fierce storms, navigated turbulent waters, faced down police batons, water cannons and tear gas in Hungary, and stepped through fields in Croatia strewn with land mines. 
 
 Now some of the asylum seekers headed toward Western and Central Europe face another worry: toxic mushrooms. 
 
 Hanover Medical School, an academic hospital in north-central Germany, warned this week that about 30 migrants had been sickened — some of them severely — after eating mushrooms commonly called death caps. 
 
 The hospital made and distributed posters in Arabic, Kurdish and other languages cautioning migrants to avoid the fungus, which is native to Europe and can cause fatal liver and kidney damage. On Thursday, similar cases of mushroom poisoning were reported in Münster, about 110 miles west of Hanover. A dozen patients remained hospitalized on Thursday, three in critical condition, Dr. Michael P. Manns, chairman of the department of gastroenterology, hepatology and endocrinology at Hanover Medical School, said in an email.

 “Do not collect mushrooms, if you are unfamiliar with edible growing mushrooms here,” the Hanover hospital warned in the poster. “A mushroom you regard from your homeland as a delicious edible mushroom could be deadly here although they look similar.” 
 
 The death cap (Amanita phalloides) resembles several varieties of edible mushrooms, making it particularly dangerous to people who are unfamiliar with the local terrain. The mushroom is found across much of Europe and in the United States, California in particular. And right now it is in the middle of its three-month growing season in Europe. 
 
 “Since this fungus has no repellent taste and the first symptoms occur only after several hours, the risk of getting sick form its consumption is extremely high,” the hospital said. It urged anyone who had eaten mushrooms and later experienced nausea, diarrhea or other symptoms to head to the nearest hospital. 
 
 The death cap is an invasive species in the United States. It typically poisons a few people a year in California, often immigrants from Southeast Asia who confuse it with paddy straw mushrooms from their homelands, according to Anne Pringle, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who studies toxic mushrooms.","– As if the thousands of migrants streaming into Europe haven't already encountered enough roadblocks, another peril looms: poisonous mushrooms known as death caps (Amanita phalloides). They resemble a number of varieties one can safely eat, and those who mistakenly forage for them can experience fatal liver and kidney damage upon consuming them. Some 35 people, most of them Syrian refugees, have been sickened by death caps in Germany in recent days, reports the AP; as of yesterday, three people were in critical condition. They're being treated at the Hannover Medical School, which lays out the dangers: ""Since this fungus has no repellent taste and the first symptoms occur only after several hours, the risk of getting sick from its consumption is extremely high."" The hospital has gone so far as to distribute posters in Arabic, Kurdish, and other languages that say just that and warn that what looks like ""a delicious edible mushroom"" is in fact poisonous in Europe, reports the New York Times. The paper notes the invasive species is found in the US, particularly in California, where it sickens a few people—often Southeast Asian immigrants who mistake it for the paddy straw mushroom—annually.","<pad> Croatia border on Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015.</s>",0.0,0.0,0.0

 The U.S. European Command said on Twitter that the U.S. ""is raising this unprofessional incident with Russia in the appropriate diplomatic and official channels.'' 
 
 Defense Department spokesman Mark Wright said Sunday that the Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane was flying a routine route in international airspace when a Russian SU-27 fighter jet flew close by ""in an unsafe and unprofessional manner.'' 
 
 ""Unprofessional air intercepts have the potential to cause harm to all air crews involved. More importantly, the careless and unprofessional actions of a single pilot have the potential to escalate tensions between countries,'' Wright said.

 Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright on Sunday said the U.S. was filing a complaint to Russia after the April 7 incident over the Baltic Sea. 
 
 Russian officials have denied their pilot did anything wrong, according to several news reports. 
 
 According to the Pentagon, the U.S. RC-135U plane was flying in international airspace north of Poland. U.S. officials say a Russian SU-27 fighter intercepted the U.S. aircraft at a high rate of speed from the rear, and then proceeded to conduct two more passes using ""unsafe and unprofessional maneuvers"" in close proximity.

 Bob Charles reaction 
 
 New Zealand golfing great Sir Bob Charles says it is impossible to entirely eliminate spectator injuries at golf events which attract large galleries. 
 
 Charles had not heard about Redmande;'s injury, and while he was disappointed to learn about it, he said spectator injuries were not surprising. 
 
 Speaking to Stuff before playing in a pro-am on the eve of the Harewood Open in Christchurch on Wednesday, the 1963 British Open champion said: ""When you get 50,000 people watching a golf event ... it's not surprising"" that injuries could happen.

 A spectator hit by a Brooks Koepka tee shot at the Ryder Cup says she has lost sight in her right eye and is considering legal action, AFP reports. 
 
 The incident happened on the opening day of the event when the American's drive on the par-four sixth hole veered off course, striking 49-year-old Corine Remande, who had travelled from Egypt. 
 
 ""Doctors told me I had lost the use of that eye,"" she told AFP.

 ""Ball strikes are an occasional hazard for spectators but this kind of incident is extremely rare. 
 
 ""We can confirm that 'fore' was shouted several times but also appreciate how hard it can be to know when and where every ball is struck if you are in the crowd. 
 
 ""We are hugely sympathetic and will do everything we can to support the spectator, insofar as that is possible under very difficult circumstances."" 
 
 Mrs Remande did praise three-time major winner Koepka, who went over to see how she was. She said she downplayed the incident so that the golfer ""would stay concentrated"". 
 
 ""It looked like it hurt,"" the 28-year-old said afterwards. 
 
 He added: ""It's hard to control a golf ball, especially for 300 yards, and a lot of times the fans are close to the fairway. 
 
 ""You can yell 'fore' but it doesn't matter from 300 yards, you can't hear it."" 
 
 Europe's winning Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn said: ""It's terrible, it's a freak accident that's happened, and all our thoughts are with her."" 
 
 There are an average 12,400 golf-related injuries which require hospital treatment each year in the UK alone, according to specialist insurance company Golf Care. 
 
 Analysis 
 
 BBC Sport golf correspondent Iain Carter 
 
 Spectating at golf tournaments can be a hazardous business. Top players are not as precise as you might expect and errant tee shots occasionally have nowhere to go other than into packed galleries. 
 
 These misdirected missiles have the speed to do plenty of damage but more often than not injuries are limited to cuts and bruises. Players usually offer a signed glove to the victim, as if that will ease the pain. 
 
 In more serious incidents, injuries can be very unsettling for the players involved. The majority sound a warning cry of ""fore"" but there are some who appear content to allow fans to be a barrier to prevent their balls from flying into deeper trouble and remain silent in the wake of wayward blows.","– A woman who got hit by a tee shot while watching the Ryder Cup last week has received some awful news: Doctors have told Corine Remande she has lost the use of one eye, reports AFP.

267,"It was the tea party the Obamas just couldn’t resist. 
 
 A White House “Alice in Wonderland” costume ball — put on by Johnny Depp and Hollywood director Tim Burton — proved to be a Mad-as-a-Hatter idea that was never made public for fear of a political backlash during hard economic times, according to a new tell-all. 
 
 “The Obamas,” by New York Times correspondent Jodi Kantor, tells of the first Halloween party the first couple feted at the White House in 2009. It was so over the top that “Star Wars” creator George Lucas sent the original Chewbacca to mingle with invited guests. 
 
 The book reveals how any official announcement of the glittering affair — coming at a time when Tea Party activists and voters furious over the lagging economy, 10-percent unemployment rate, bank bailouts and Obama’s health-care plan were staging protests — quickly vanished down the rabbit hole. 
 
 “White House officials were so nervous about how a splashy, Hollywood-esque party would look to jobless Americans — or their representatives in Congress, who would soon vote on health care — that the event was not discussed publicly and Burton’s and Depp’s contributions went unacknowledged,” the book says. 
 
 However, the White House made certain that more humble Halloween festivities earlier that day — for thousands of Washington-area schoolkids — were well reported by the press corps. 
 
 Then the Obamas went inside, where an invitation-only affair for children of military personnel and White House administrators unfolded in the East Room. 
 
 Unbeknownst to reporters, the State Dining Room had also been transformed into a secretive White House Wonderland. 
 
 Tim Burton decorated it “in his signature creepy-comic style. His film version was about to be released, and he had turned the room into the Mad Hatter’s tea party, with a long table set with antique-looking linens, enormous stuffed animals in chairs, and tiered serving plates with treats like bone-shaped meringue cookies,” reports the book, which The Post purchased at a Manhattan bookstore. 
 
 “Fruit punch was served in blood vials at the bar. Burton’s own Mad Hatter, the actor Johnny Depp, presided over the scene in full costume, standing up on a table to welcome everyone in character.” 
 
 The Obamas’ daughters, Malia and Sasha, then 11 and 8 respectively, “sat at the table, surrounded by a gaggle of their friends, and then proceeded to the next delight, a magic show in the East Room.” 
 
 Kantor’s book details more personal aspects of the Obama White House, serving up glimpses of the first couple’s marriage, parenting, sometimes tense handling of staff issues and even the president’s sly sense of humor when it comes to race. 
 
 One morning during his Senate campaign, Obama didn’t show up to a meeting with donors. “After a frantic search, a white staffer named Peter Coffey called Obama’s barbershop to find that, yes, he was there.” 
 
 The president confronted Coffey about the call later that day. 
 
 “ ‘The relationship between a black man and his barber is sacred,’ Obama bellowed . . . ‘For failing to understand this truth, your punishment is to watch the movie “Barbershop.” And for further punishment, you will then watch the sequel, “Barbershop 2.” ’ ” 
 
 Often White House staffers found themselves in the middle of husband-and-wife quarrels. 
 
 “The advisors could feel hopelessly caught between husband and wife,” Kantor writes. “The Obama marriage was awkward for everyone: for the aides, for the president . . . and for the first lady.” ||||| A White House official told POLITICO Sunday that a Halloween party thrown for military families in 2009 was no secret and that there was no conspiracy to cover-up the role of two well-known Hollywood figures. 
 
 In her new book ""The Obamas,"" Jodi Kantor reports that the White House communications staff was concerned about the optics of the Obamas hosting a star-studded 'Alice in Wonderland'-themed Halloween party in a time of economic misery. As a result, Kantor reports, they did not highlight the role that director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp played at the event. Burton helped decorate the White House for the party, while Depp attended in costume as the Mad Hatter. 
 
 Several news outlets, including Fox News, the New York Post and others characterized the party as ""secret."" 
 
 ""This was an event for local school children from the Washington DC area and for hundreds of military families. If we wanted this event to be a secret, we probably wouldn't have invited the press corps to cover it, release photos of it to Flickr, or post a video from it on the White House website,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement. ""Even Johnny Depp’s fans knew about it and posted on their website. Just goes to show you can't believe everything you read in books these days."" 
 
 The official White House social media releases and the reporter pool dispatches from the party do not mention either Burton or Depp, but the Depp fan site JohnnyDeppNews.com reported that the actor was in attendance with Burton. And the Nashville Tennessean also reported that both Depp and Burton were at the White House for the party. Then-White House press secretary Robert Gibbs addressed the event in his briefing, but did not go into any detail. 
 
 UPDATE 2/2/2012: Author Jodi Kantor emails: ""The reporting in my book on the 2009 Halloween celebrations is accurate. Here is the key distinction, which I explained on page 132: the trick or treating that took place outside was well-documented, with photographs that were released, pool reports, and so on. But the party inside the White House, which Tim Burton and Johnny Depp contributed to, was kept quiet. The White House never acknowledged their contributions, did not allow the pool reporter inside, etc. The Washington Post checked this independently as well. "" ||||| There was a government handout under way at the White House on Saturday evening — a sweet one. 
 
 President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, celebrated Halloween by handing out candy and other goodies to more than 2,000 trick-or-treaters from selected Washington, Virginia and Maryland elementary schools. The children filled the North Lawn of the White House — bathed in orange light for the occasion — as a giant black spider and a long web dangled from the North Portico. 
 
 It was the first Halloween at the White House for the Obama family, and they opened up the gates to kids, ages 6 to 14, who were allowed to roam around in their costumes. It was a curious scene, with goblins, monsters and characters of all kinds mingling around real-life Secret Service agents. 
 
 Mr. Obama did not dress up, wearing just a sweater and slacks — perhaps his costume was president of the United States. Mrs. Obama played the role of Cat Woman. The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, dressed as Darth Vader, and the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, went as the Disney character Goofy. 
 
 For about 30 minutes, the president, the first lady and the first grandmother, Marian Robinson, smiled broadly as they handed out treats on the front steps of the North Portico. 
 
 Later, a few hundred military families, chosen by each service, roamed the first floor of the White House as an old-fashioned turntable played albums. Costumes and characters abounded. 
 
 “They’re adorable,” Mr. Obama said, “as is, by the way, my wife — a very nice-looking Cat Woman.” 
 
 So what kind of loot did the president prepare? 
 
 A white-and-blue box of M&Ms — imprinted with Mr. Obama’s autograph — and a sweet butter cookie made by the White House pastry chef. And in keeping with the theme of healthy eating inside the White House that Mrs. Obama has promoted, the children were also given a dried fruit mix of cherries, apricots, pears, apples and papayas.","– At the nadir of the economic crisis, the Obama White House held a lavish Alice in Wonderland-themed Halloween costume party, organized by Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and full of Star Wars character.

Both Raytheon and the science foundation say that it would be too dangerous to send a rescue plane to the South Pole now and that Ms. Douceur’s condition is not life-threatening. 
 
 “During the winter period, extremely cold temperatures and high winds make an extraction dangerous for all involved, passengers as well as crew,” said Jon Kasle, a Raytheon spokesman, “and such an extraction is considered only in life-threatening conditions.” 
 
 Ms. Douceur, 58, of Seabrook, N.H., is in stable condition but said she had partial vision loss in both eyes. She is on medical leave from her job and spends part of every day on an oxygen therapy device that helps her breathe in the high altitude, she said. 
 
 The first cargo flight of the spring is to leave Oct. 17 — weather permitting — from the South Pole for McMurdo Station, on the Antarctic coast. From there, Ms. Douceur would fly to New Zealand for medical attention. 
 
 To Ms. Douceur and Sydney Raines, her niece, that is not soon enough. Last month, Ms. Raines started a campaign to put pressure on the National Science Foundation and Raytheon. 
 
 “My question back to them is, By what standard is a stroke considered a nonemergency?” said Ms. Raines, who was raised by Ms. Douceur. 
 
 Ms. Raines has set up a Web site, Saverenee.org, and a Facebook page that urge people to call officials at Raytheon and the National Science Foundation. A petition at Whitehouse.gov has more than 700 signatures. Ms. Raines has enlisted the help of Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, who wrote to the foundation. 
 
 “They’re saying the risk is too high,” said Ms. Douceur, who has worked at the South Pole on and off for three years. “But why aren’t you mobilizing and prepositioning planes so that when the weather breaks, you can come get me, instead of just saying, ‘No, you’re O.K., you’re going to wait’? It feels like they’re just stonewalling.” 
 
 Treating a stroke victim without access to imaging technology is difficult, said Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, deputy director at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, because it is impossible to be sure what kind of stroke occurred. “If it’s a blockage of the blood vessel, the damage is done,” he said. But if the problem is a hemorrhaging vessel, more damage could still occur, “because that blood vessel is feeding brain that’s undamaged yet.” 
 
 The most famous instance of a person being airlifted from the South Pole for medical reasons was that involving Jerri Nielsen FitzGerald, a doctor who treated herself for breast cancer for months while stationed at the American research station. When she departed, on Oct. 16, 1999, it was the earliest in the Antarctic spring that a plane had taken off, according to The Antarctic Sun, a newspaper put out by the United States Antarctic Program, which is run by the National Science Foundation. She died in 2009 of a recurrence of breast cancer. 
 
 Temperatures must be higher than minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit for most planes to land at Amundsen-Scott or the fuel will turn to jelly. While that threshold has been crossed at the South Pole recently, the temperature still regularly dips to 70 degrees below zero. 
 
 “A risky rescue flight might not only jeopardize the health and safety of the patient but that of the flight crew and personnel on the ground at South Pole as well,” said Deborah Wing, a spokeswoman for the National Science Foundation. 
 
 Ms. Douceur and Raytheon are also tussling over whether a medical attendant should be on the Oct. 17 flight. She says she is worried about the effects of flying on her already oxygen-deprived brain and wants a medical professional on board. Raytheon has offered to send an unspecified “attendant,” she said. The company declined to comment. 
 
 Flying into Amundsen-Scott during the Antarctic winter, which runs from mid-February until late October, is indeed dangerous, said Col. Ronnie Smith, a former Air Force navigator who has flown there about 300 times. 
 
 “It’s like no other airfield in the U.S.,” Colonel Smith said. A pilot landing a plane there in winter, when it is dark 24 hours a day, would be flying blind “because you can’t install lights under the ice,” he said. 
 
 “You need low wind conditions, because even a 15-mile-per-hour wind will blow the loose snow around 100 or 200 feet up in the air,” Colonel Smith said. ||||| The manager of the U.S. South Pole station wants to be evacuated, saying she suffered a stroke more than a month ago. But U.S. polar officials say she'll have to wait until special ski-equipped airplanes can land at the frozen base several weeks from now. 
 
 The dispute between site manager Renee-Nicole Douceur, the National Science Foundation and the operator of the base, Raytheon Polar Services, has been simmering since Douceur said she suffered a stroke on Aug. 27. The physician at the U.S.-run Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station recommended her immediate evacuation. But consulting doctors hired by Raytheon and the NSF disagreed. 
 
 PHOTOS: Scott of the Antarctic: Hero or Failure? 
 
 Since then, Douceur's family has set up a website to gain support for her cause and enlisted the aid of U.S. Sen. Jean Shaheen, D-N.H. She's also hired an attorney to help her plead her case. 
 
 In a phone interview with Discovery News, Douceur said she suffers from blurry vision and is worried about long-term effects to her health. She says she can't wait another few weeks. 
 
 ""I'm just hanging in there and I'm looking out my window and it's nice and clear bright and sunny,"" Douceur said. I'm saying to myself why isn't there a plane here to get me out of here today or even yesterday?"" 
 
 Douceur said she worried that she may have had an aneurysm or a blood clot to the brain. The base doesn't have MRI or other scanning equipment to do make that diagnosis. 
 
 ""I have not been treated fairly here,"" Douceur said. ""They have been making decisions based on budgets. Isn't a stroke a serious thing?"" 
 
 Representatives of the NSF and Raytheon say a medical evacuation over the Antarctic continent is risky and only attempted if there's a life-threatening condition. 
 
 In 1999, for example, base doctor Jerri Nielson was airlifted evacuated in mid-October after treating herself for breast cancer over winter. She died in 2009. In August 2001, another base doctor, Ron Shemenski, was evacuated to Chile after he was diagnosed with potentially life-threatening pancreatitis. 
 
 NSF officials in Washington said they are checking in daily on Douceur. 
 
 ""In considering whether to attempt a very risky emergency medical evacuation during the challenging winter season in Antarctica, NSF must always balance the patient's condition with the possibility for injury or the loss of life of the patient, the flight crew and personnel on the ground at South Pole against the potential benefits to the patient,"" an NSF spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement. 
 
 ""We are continuing to monitor the patient's condition closely and are prepared to consider alternative courses of action if merited by a change in condition, as determined by medical experts."" 
 
 There are about 50 workers who are over-wintering at the station, which is located at the bottom of the planet and is three to five hours by air (depending on the aircraft) to McMurdo Station, the main U.S. research facility in Antarctica. From McMurdo, it's another four-hour flight to Christchurch, New Zealand, the closest city with advanced medical facilities.

 Some airplanes can make the trip, but extreme cold freezes engines and hydraulic fluids, not to mention the difficulty of landing on an airstrip that can't be cleared of snow and ice. 
 
 The South Pole's clear skies and unique location make it a perfect place to study astrophysics, astronomy and atmospheric chemistry. Both scientists receiving government grants and staff workers hired by Raytheon assume a certain amount of risk, U.S. officials say, since conditions in Antarctica are treacherous. 
 
 Temperatures at the pole are currently around 58 degrees below zero, with a wind chill of close to minus 87, according to a weather website operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
 
 The Amundsen-Scott base is equipped with a medical clinic, fuel, food and supplies for the six-month winter-over. But once the last flight leaves in late February, nobody can leave until late October. 
 
 Douceur is a 58-year old retired nuclear engineer from Hampton Falls, N.H. She said she has spent several years working in Antarctica managing the two U.S. bases, but was making her first 12-month stay at the South Pole. 
 
 She says NSF officials have told her that specially equipped Twin Otter aircraft will be landing at the South Pole on Oct. 13 to refuel, and then continue on to McMurdo. If all goes according to plan, the planes will return and pick her up several days later. She would then be transferred to a larger C-130 Hercules transport for the leg to New Zealand.

 A link to the video was posted this week on the Twitter account of a user who often disseminates Taliban propaganda. A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the dog was captured after a long firefight between coalition forces and Taliban fighters in the Alin Nigar district of Afghanistan’s Laghman province in late December. 
 
 “The mujahideen valorously put tough resistance against the troops for hours,” he said in a phone interview Thursday. The dog, he said, carries the rank of colonel and was outfitted with sophisticated electronic devices. 
 
 “The dog was of high significance to the Americans,” he said. 
 
 Lt. Col. Will Griffin, a spokesman for the international military coalition in Afghanistan, confirmed Thursday in an e-mail that the force lost a military working dog during an operation in December. He did not provide further details. Officials at the Pentagon said they could recall no prior instance of a military working dog being taken captive. 
 
 The canine was attached to a British special forces unit that was engaged in a fatal firefight on Dec. 23, according to a military official who confirmed the nationality of the dog on the condition of anonymity because the British Defense Ministry has chosen not to do so. 
 
 Also featured in the video are two M-4 assault rifles with scopes that are commonly used by special operations forces in Afghanistan. 
 
 The video caught the attention of analysts at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks and studies insurgent propaganda. The group’s founder, Rita Katz, said she could not recall anything like it. 
 
 “I don’t remember seeing a dog used as a hostage,” she said after checking her database. The only time canines were featured in insurgent propaganda, Katz said, was in Iraq when insurgents once proposed using them as unsuspecting suicide bombers. 
 
 U.S. Special Operations troops often use the Belgian Malinois, a breed favored for its light weight, agility and endurance. They are trained to parachute and rappel with their handlers. Some are trained to sniff out explosives; others learn how to find narcotics. In Afghanistan, canines are often used to search compounds that might be rigged with explosives before humans move in. 
 
 The use of dogs in combat missions has been one of the grievances Afghan President Hamid Karzai has raised with his foreign benefactors. Many Muslims hold a dim view of canines and worry that being around the animals makes them impure — thus unfit to pray. 
 
 Few Afghans keep them as pets, although many groom the animals for dogfighting, a popular gambling sport that was banned by the Taliban but has become popular again. 
 
 Military working dogs have been killed in bombings and shootings in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 
 “Maybe the dog was released to attack or search off-leash and the dog never returned,” said Kevin Dredden, a former Air Force dog handler and Afghanistan veteran who works as a program manager at AMK9, a firm that trains dogs to work with law enforcement and military units. “Maybe it was unsafe for them to go back and find him.” 
 
 One thing is certain, Dredden said. 
 
 “I know for sure the handler is devastated,” he said, noting the tight bonds that handlers and military dogs forge. 
 
 Dogs are given ranks that make them senior to their handlers, a practice designed to ensure that the humans treat the animals with deference. They have a rank patch on their body armor. 
 
 When President Obama visited Fort Campbell, Ky., to thank the elite troops who found and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, the name of only one of the special operators was disclosed: Cairo, the team’s Belgian Malinois.

In the video, it is seen wearing the equipment as its chain leash is held by a Taliban fighter. Four other armed and bearded Taliban fighters stand nearby around what appears to be a mud and stone terrace. It was unclear when the video was taken or if the dog is still alive. 
 
 Coalition forces have long used sniffer and protection dogs in Afghanistan, mostly German shepherds, Labradors or spaniels. Hundreds have been used by coalition forces in Afghanistan, often for sniffing out bombs. Last year, Army Pfc. Levi Lutrell told the Global Post that dogs are trained to detect detonation cords that are buried to ignite IEDs.

 In 2013, a ""Zwarte Piet,"" or ""Black Pete,"" jokes with children after arriving with Sinterklaas, or Saint Nicholas, by steamboat in Hoorn, Netherlands. Protests and demonstrations from minority groups have rocked such celebrations in recent years in Dutch cities. (Peter Dejong/AP) 
 
 Over multiple years now, WorldViews has run stories about the problematic Dutch tradition of Zwarte Piet. Around Christmastime, myriad Dutch adults and children have customarily donned frilly wigs, patted themselves in blackface, painted their lips red and japed around in costumes as ""Black Pete,"" the dark-skinned helpers of Sinterklaas, or Saint Nicholas. 
 
 For reasons that are both obvious and complicated, many people think the tradition is racist — one that is shaped by the country's not-so-distant colonial past and trades on garish racial stereotypes. 
 
 Others, including a significant proportion of the Dutch public, are less sure. They argue that the legend of Sinterklass and his swarthy sidekicks predates any colonial entanglements and the legacy of slavery. Dressing up as the trickster figure, they say, is an innocent, jovial children's pastime. Even minorities in the Netherlands embrace the tradition, some say. (Last year, we addressed each of those arguments here.) 
 
 Protests and demonstrations from minority groups have rocked Sinterklaas celebrations in recent years in Dutch cities. In August 2015, a United Nations-convened committee on racial discrimination in Geneva called on the Dutch government to ""promote the elimination of those features of the character of Black Pete which reflect negative stereotypes and are experienced by many people of African descent as a vestige of slavery."" 
 
 The growing backlash to Zwarte Piet seems to have had an effect. Last year, Dutch primary schools abolished the sporting of physical markings during Sinterklaas that could be deemed offensive, including blackface, thick lips and gold earrings. And on Friday, the country's children's ombudsman, a post linked to the government's oversight agency, issued a report arguing the tradition violates children's rights. 
 
 After interviews with Dutch children, Margrite Kalverboer, the ombudswoman, said Zwarte Piet should ""be stripped of discriminatory or stereotypical characteristics."" Otherwise, the Netherlands risked contravening conventions on children's rights to equal treatment and protection from discrimination. 
 
 ""Many children of color say they experience discrimination in their daily lives and that it is worse around the time of Sinterklaas,"" the report states. Changing the long-standing characteristics of Zwarte Piet would enable all children to ""experience the joy of the tradition."" 
 
 Dutch politicians have largely tried to dismiss controversy surrounding Zwarte Piet as inconsequential, but one's attitude about such blackface antics is increasingly part of a political fault line in the country. 
 
 Far-right politician Geert Wilders has repeatedly spoken in defense of Zwarte Piet, even proposing a law that would ensure the character is preserved exactly as it is. Meanwhile, a burgeoning leftist, pro-immigrant party has called for a wider Dutch reckoning with the nation's multicultural identity that would include a museum about the history of slavery as well as the abolition of the black minstrel figure.

A video by comedy show Zondag met Lubach introducing President Donald Trump to the Netherlands racked up more than a million hits in its first day online, the Telegraph reports. Since Trump made it clear in his inaugural speech that he intends to put America first, the narrator of the video—who does a spot-on Trump impression—has one small request: Put the Netherlands second? In order to sell Trump on the idea, he lists some of the country's best attributes. For example, the Afsluitdijk is right up Trump's alley: It's a massive wall that, in the narrator's view, ""we built to protect us from all the water from Mexico."" ""This Dutch video on Trump has gone viral because, well, just watch it,"" urges Mashable. Another choice line: ""We've got Ponypark Slagharen, which has got to be the best ponypark in the world,"" the narrator says over footage of tourists romping with ponies at an amusement park. ""It's true. They're the best ponies, they are. You can ride them, you can date them, you can grab 'em by the pony. It's fantastic."" Adweek calls the video ""hilarious,"" noting that the Netherlands itself isn't left unscathed by the satire. The narrator points out, for example, the country's Christmas ""Black Pete"" tradition, which, as the Washington Post explained last year, sees participants don blackface in order to portray Black Pete, a dark-skinned assistant to Saint Nicholas. ""It's the most offensive, the most racist thing you've ever seen,"" the narrator says. ""You'll love it. It's great.""","<pad> – The Dutch have been a major contributor to the Sinterklaas tradition for years, and WorldViews has been a source of controversy. In a recent interview with WorldViews, the Dutch president said that the tradition is racist, and that ""the Dutch are not racist."" The AP reports that the tradition is a tradition that has been around for decades, and that some people think it's racist. Others, including a significant proportion of the Dutch public, are less sure. They say the legend of Sinterklass and his swarthy side",0.15510203720249904,0.024390240152439603,0.12244897597800929
272,"It's one of the most tweeted, blogged and hyped pop singles in recent memory. The title was announced more than six months ago, with the lyrics leaked piecemeal by the lady herself. Elton John has claimed it's ""the new gay anthem"", Justin Bieber and James Blunt tried to predict what it would sound like, while others have criticised the racial terminology in the lyrics. It was due to premiere on US radio at 6am EST, but has since been shoved online by Perez Hilton. 
 
 So what does it sound like? Well, a lot like Madonna's Express Yourself, so much so that those two words are currently trending on Twitter. There's also some spoken-word bits a la the Material Girl (as no one calls her any more), but it doesn't sound copycat, more a knowing nod and a cute wink. 
 
 Born This Way is a thumping, almost disco anthem that stomps along until the chorus crashes in with the weight of a discarded meat dress. Lyrically, it's all love yourself whoever you are and ""don't be a drag, just be a queen"". Within the ridiculously camp musical context, the lyrics sound a lot less heavy-handed than it would suggest. One suspects it will probably shift a few copies.

 Good news about Lady Gaga: She’s smart enough to know precisely when to stop acting smart. 
 
 Consider this: I just woke up, at five-thirty in the morning, to attend to the unveiling of her big new single, “Born This Way.” (Big enough that there was basically no question, before anyone even heard the thing, that it would run straight to No. 1 on the charts  Billboard’s 1,000th official chart-topper, actually.) I dragged diligently out of bed. I made a serious pot of coffee. I got all psyched to bring as much high-level analytical skill as I could muster to whatever this song turned out to be. Time to make the critical doughnuts, etc.  no point in rolling out of bed early just to say “nice song.” 
 
 And this one seemed like it might be complicated, too. Because we’d already seen the lyrics to “Born This Way,” and I can’t even tell you how skeptical they made me. “You’re black, white, beige, chola descent / You’re Lebanese, you’re Orient?” Gaga said she wrote this in ten minutes; rhyming “chola descent” with “Orient” is what happens when you do that. The main hook  “don’t be a drag, just be a queen”  that’s a good one, good for pop, applicable to all. But it comes after months and months of what one terrific critic has already called “The Great Gay Pander-Off of 2010”: A long run of housey dance tunes in which half the women of pop sing reassuringly about embracing and celebrating ourselves for whoever we are. 
 
 These songs are all fundamentally good-hearted and probably good for the world, but they’re also strange. They nod to gay struggles, or all the attention that’s been paid to bullying and suicide. (Ke$ha has variously claimed that “We R Who We R” was inspired by teen suicide, or else by seeing a drag show long before “It Gets Better” was a thing.) But the real goal is to do what pop does, and open up that circle of self-acceptance to anyone who wants in. And that’s something worth thinking about, and maybe even being skeptical of, because at some point we might all start using gay men as simple totems or avatars for whatever little personal struggles we go through, right down to the point where some horrible egomaniac on a reality-TV show starts talking about having been born that way. This is a weird amount of pop songs in which, to put it really bluntly, white women point to gay men to explain to all of us how to survive. Not bad, just weird. Because all of these songs get to look like they're giving something to a community they're really taking something from. 
 
 “Born This Way” opens up the circle as wide as it can, shouting out ethnic backgrounds with fascinating specificity, and working in a line about the disabled. Never mind that I guarantee you Lady Gaga will eventually make some aesthetic choice that offends or disappoints members of every community she reaches out to. Consider instead that the greatest trick Lady Gaga has pulled  the thing that makes her a genuinely impressive pop star  is creating an atmosphere where people can legitimately feel like revolutionary all-embracing gender-queering “little monsters” by listening to one of the most popular artists in the country. That’s rare and makes for vital pop. 
 
 And it’s with all this in mind that I sit down with the serious pot of coffee and listen to “Born This Way,” wondering what all will be in there and how it will make me feel about all these issues, wondering what kind of musical presentation can possibly pull off these somewhat bonkers lyrics about being-who-you-are  (the only people excluded by this type of song are those who are not exactly sure who they are in the first place)  and the answer comes and it’s bonkers mecha-disco! The sound of Lady Gaga shouting in my ear that I am totally overthinking things, this time. The song’s so disco that the mention of a mother’s “boudoir” in the first verse becomes totally natural and hilarious. The song’s so disco that the line about people being “Orient-made” barely even registers, because it sounds like something nobody would have thought twice about saying in 1978. The vocals are so bonkers disco that I almost wish we could make them extra-bonkers by having Christina Aguilera sing them. Beyond which, this song has Gaga, an artist constantly compared to Madonna, cheerfully swiping some melodies from Madonna's ""Express Yourself""  because this is not the kind of song where that feels like a big deal, or anything much at all seems like a big deal. 
 
 I guess I’d forgotten that this is the thing to do when you’ve reached the top, and everyone is celebrating you and awaiting your next move: Just sort of celebrate back. “Born This Way” is loose and uncomplicated and fundamentally just fun; it uses fans’ goodwill toward Gaga to throw a party instead of an art happening. After a year of everyone up to Camille Paglia bringing all kinds of intense critical thought to everything Gaga does  what does she mean, what is she saying, what is her effect on the culture  this is smart: Come raging back with something simple, gleeful, and straightforward.

She sent her fans into a frenzy in September at the MTV Video Music Awards by launching into an a cappella take on the song's chorus. In late January, she leaked the lyrics to 'Born This Way' on Twitter, and soon thereafter announced that she was moving up the single's release date from Feb. 13 to Feb. 11, tweeting , ""Can't wait any longer.""""I think 'Born This Way' is the kind of record that if you are really paying attention you will get the full depth of Gaga as a songwriter,"" Akon, a frequent Gaga collaborator who signed the pop star to his Kon Live Distribution label in 2007, recently told.

The newspaper notes that one Twitter user even claims, “you can literally sing the original over this one.” Nitsuh Abebe went into his first listen of the track completely prepared to analyze its deeper meaning, especially in regards to the gay community, but was soon overwhelmed by the fact that the song is “bonkers mecha-disco,” he writes in New York. “The song’s so disco that the line about people being ‘Orient-made’ barely even registers, because it sounds like something nobody would have thought twice about saying in 1978.” The Huffington Post notes that some believe this will become “a legendary anthem.” One of those people is Elton John, who told Rolling Stone he believes “Born This Way” will “obliterate 'I Will Survive.'

273,"A sixth person has died in Sacramento County as a result of ingesting pills made to look like a prescription painkiller, health officials confirmed Tuesday. 
 
 A total of 28 cases of people becoming sick from the street-bought drug have been reported, including the six people who have died, according to the Sacramento County Division of Public Health. 
 
 UPDATE (March 31): A seventh person has died due to ingesting the street-bought painkiller. Read more here. 
 
 “I've never seen a substance like this,” said Jon Daily, founder of Recovery Happens and an addiction specialist with more than 20 years experience. “Fentanyl is eight times stronger than heroin or 800 percent stronger than heroin, it's a very potent substance.” 
 
 Initial reports that came in Thursday said people overdosed on street Norco pills -- a prescription painkiller made of hydrocodone and acetaminophen -- laced with fentanyl, which is estimated to be 80 times as potent as morphine and hundreds of times more potent than heroin. 
 
 “It is not fentanyl-laced Norco because they haven't found any acetaminophen, which would be in Norco,” Daily said. 
 
 Toxicology reports Tuesday show the pills are actually fentanyl pills made to look like Norco tablets. The health department said the test results showed signs of hydrocodone and acetaminophen. 
 
 “It concerns me because it's part of a distribution network of drug dealing going on in our community,” Daily said. “There's probably more to come.”

Fentanyl is a painkiller much stronger than morphine and can produce a euphoric high, reports the Los Angeles Times.

""We hoped it would never come here,"" one San Francisco-based DEA agent says. ""But it was only a matter of time."" Fentanyl is often disguised as other drugs, and the California victims likely thought they were taking the prescription painkiller Norco, KCRA reports.

274,"The ""rock star from Mars"" has landed — in another TV show.Four months after getting axed from CBS' ""Two and a Half Men"" when he publicly attacked his bosses, Charlie Sheen was officially announced Monday as the star in ""Anger Management,"" a proposed sitcom adaptation that seems destined for basic cable and is loosely based on the 2003 movie starring Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler . Sheen will play the Nicholson character, a provocative doctor with some odd therapeutic techniques.According to a release, Sheen will retain ""a significant ownership stake"" in the show, whose producers will include former Walt Disney Studios chairman and Revolution Studios founder Joe Roth . Lionsgate Television will be among the producers while the company's distribution arm, Debmar-Mercury, will scout for network partners. That assumes, of course, that Sheen — who made ""Duh! Winning!"" a national catchphrase — can win back the TV industry's trust enough for network bosses to roll the dice with him again.""I chose 'Anger Management' because, while it might be a big stretch for me to play a guy with serious anger management issues, I think it is a great concept,"" a characteristically cheeky Sheen said in a statement. ""It also provides me with real ownership in the series, a certain amount of creative control and the chance to be back in business with one of my favorite movie producers of all time, Joe Roth.""Through a spokesman, Sheen and Roth declined to be interviewed.Sheen had reportedly been negotiating for the project, but many crucial details are still being worked out. The release sent out Monday morning does not say when filming will start, who his costars or lead writers will be or, most important, which network might air the project.Debmar-Mercury, which syndicates fare such as ""The Wendy Williams Show,"" says that for ""Anger Management"" it will use an unusual sitcom business model it helped pioneer. Traditionally, TV producers spend months developing a pilot and then angling for a series order from network bosses. But in this case, a network partner will be asked to order a limited number of episodes upfront — perhaps 10 or fewer. If the early episodes deliver good ratings, the network will then be obligated to order 90 more episodes — thus enabling the syndicator to hit the magic number of 100 that makes it easier to sell lucrative reruns to local stations.Debmar-Mercury has employed this approach for a batch of Tyler Perry sitcoms on TBS , including ""House of Payne,"" ""Meet the Browns"" and ""Are We There Yet?"" Sheen was one of TV's highest-paid stars on ""Two and a Half Men,"" with a per-episode paycheck that approached $2 million. He could conceivably see another astronomical payday as a profit participant on ""Anger Management"" — but only if the series taps that rich syndicated market.The big question now is which network might bite.An NBC spokesman declined to comment, but an insider said the network won't bid on Sheen's new project. A CBS spokesman declined to comment, but it's a long shot at best that the nation's most-watched network would bid on Sheen's new comedy after enduring a high-wire drama with the actor the past several years. Representatives for Fox and ABC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Sheen's drug problems forced ""Two and a Half Men"" to shut down production two years in a row; in the middle of his at-home rehab earlier this year, he took to bashing his bosses on radio programs, Internet and TV news shows, calling his boss, executive producer Chuck Lorre , a ""spineless rat"" and dubbing himself a ""rock star from Mars"" who did not play by the usual human rules. That kind of record would make Sheen — whatever his outlaw appeal to many fans — a risk to any broadcaster worried about advertising and viewer reactions.""His personal, professional and business unpredictability make him a real gamble for any channel that would be considering him,"" said Jeffrey McCall, a professor of media studies at DePauw University. ""I can't imagine any of the big four networks taking a chance on him, not just because of the unpredictability, but because of the potential bad PR that could accompany the association.""But a smaller cable network could be another story, McCall added. ""Cable channels are not necessarily expected to provide cultural or programming leadership, so there is less to lose if the Sheen program crashed for whatever reason,"" he said. ""I can see this show ending up on TBS, FX , USA or some other cable outlet that does original programming, but to smaller, targeted demos."" (A sale to TBS could prove problematic, however, as the outlet is owned by Time Warner , whose TV studio fired Sheen from ""Men"" and is currently embroiled in litigation with the actor over his removal from the series.)Roth and Sheen previously worked on several movie projects together, including ""Major League,"" one of Sheen's biggest hits.""Who better than Charlie Sheen to tackle 'Anger Management,'"" Roth said in the release. ""With Charlie's incredible talent and comedic gifts, he remains the leading man of TV sitcoms. I'm excited to collaborate with him once again.""The producers of ""Two and a Half Men"" eventually hired Ashton Kutcher to replace Sheen and the No. 1-ranked comedy is slated to return to CBS Monday nights in the fall.The good news for Sheen is that he likely has yet to exhaust the patience of American viewers, who seem to have an unquenchable thirst for celebrities who behave badly.As McCall put it, ""In this day and age, it is hard to see any American celebrity as permanently damaged goods."" ||||| Charlie Sheen's ex-wife will head south of the border to enroll in an ""extreme"" rehab program, where she will take a controversial hallucinogen used to curb drug addiction and aid in the recovery process. 
 
 Brooke Mueller hopes that the seven-day treatment in a Mexican clinic with the hallucinogen Ibogaine will help ""rewire"" her brain, according to TMZ. The troubled celebrity, who has two young boys with Charlie Sheen, has been in and out of rehab several times, and hopes the treatment will finally end her visits once and for all. 
 
 Last month, Mueller ended 45 days in rehab, but since then, she has been photographed holding a crack pipe and reportedly ejected from a plane for erratic behavior. Mueller's camp did not return multiple requests for comment. 
 
 Ibogaine is a psychoactive chemical compound that is found naturally in the root bark of the West African iboga shrub. The drug is used by members of certain African tribes and religions during healing and rite-of-passage ceremonies. Studies have shown that the drug curbs symptoms and prevents drug cravings for people trying to get clean. 
 
 The hallucinogen is illegal in the United States, where it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance, meaning it has ""high potential for abuse"" and ""no currently accepted medical use in treatment."" It is legal in several other countries, including Canada and Mexico, and clinics have been set up for drug addicts seeking the hallucinogenic treatment. Experts say Ibogaine does not contain addictive properties, but has caused some deaths. 
 
 ""Ibogaine treats opiate withdrawal through a biological effect, and also induces a psychospiritual state or mystical state of consciousness that is similar to other hallucinogens like LSD,"" said Dr. Stephen Ross, director of NYU Langone's Center of Excellence on Addiction. 
 
 It is not the first time that hallucinogens have been used to cure drug addiction. In the 1960s, several specialists studied LSD as a treatment for the disease. "" 
 
 Some people swear by it,"" said Dr. Daniel H.Angres, medical director of Resurrection Behavioral Health - Addiction Services, reiterating that most addiction experts are skeptical of quick fixes. ""Despite any possible usefulness, there are safer, more conservative, pharmacological approaches that have better data."" 
 
 For those who take Ibogaine, they ""may have visual hallucinations where they will feel they're transported beyond three-dimensional time and space,"" said Ross. ""They may feel interconnected to a higher form of energy, their consciousness is part of a greater consciousness, and have a sense of sacredness, awe and reverence."" 
 
 That might sound pretty good to some people, but without proper supervision from a clinician or sitter, a person can experience frightening trips that include extreme paranoia and anxiety. 
 
 While the hallucinogen does indeed have promise in treating drug addiction, there have been about 20 deaths associated with its use. Ross said the drug can cause heart arrhythmias, which, combined with other drugs, could be deadly. He also said that the therapy is not good for people with significant mental illness, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, because evidence shows that people with those conditions can relapse. 
 
 But even if Mueller does experience a spiritual awakening, experts say it is only the beginning in a long recovery process. 
 
 Ibogaine May Help Addicts Overcome Addiction 
 
 ""She may have an experience where she realizes a stark choice between her kids or drugs, but, unless she's with someone who understands the nature and after-care of this drug, the effects can wear off,"" said Ross. ""Rarely would an experience like this, without post-therapy, cause long-term recovery and sobriety."" 
 
 And other experts agreed. No matter the initial treatment, addicts are doomed if they don't participate in rigorous follow-up treatment and structure to continue on the path of sobriety. 
 
 ""Sad, truly sad, both for her, and the children, in particular,"" said Dr. Scott Basinger, associate dean of extramural affairs at Baylor College of Medicine. ""[I] feel that her multiple relapses are a failure, not of the rehabilitation programs she has attended, but of her total unwillingness to follow an aftercare program."" 
 
 Basinger noted that rehabilitation, whether ""extreme"" or in a conventional program, is only a ""band-aid to the disease of addiction."" 
 
 ""Without a well designed post-rehab program of therapy, 12-step meetings, and a serious, total commitment to not only [to] get sober, but stay sober and make recovery the number one priority, relapse is almost inevitable,"" said Basinger. 
 
 ""This is particularly hard with those in the limelight,"" said Angre. ""For anyone with a history of multiple relapses following treatment, it is often necessary to have a very extended stay that might even include a supportive living environment-- not seven days, but perhaps seven months is a better idea in my estimation.""

275,"A wealthy Manhattan landlord left $20 million to his two daughters — but they can collect only on his strict terms. 
 
 Daddy Dearest real estate millionaire Maurice Laboz, who died earlier this year, doled out early-bird bonuses to his girls in his will as long as they marry right, get good jobs and don’t even think about having kids out of wedlock. 
 
 The Laboz girls — Marlena, 21, and Victoria, 17 — are set to inherit $10 million apiece when they turn 35. But they can get their hands on some of the dough beforehand if they follow Daddy’s rules for the straight and narrow. For example: 
 
 Marlena will get $500,000 for tying the knot, but only if her husband signs a sworn statement promising to keep his hands off the cash. 
 
 She nets another $750,000 if she graduates “from an accredited university” and writes “100 words or less describing what she intends to do with the funds” — with the trustees appointed by her dad to oversee her money responsible for approving her essay. 
 
 Both daughters get a big incentive to earn decent salaries by 2020. Each young woman is guaranteed to receive an annual payout of three times the income listed on their personal federal tax return. In a not-so-subtle nod to the taxman, their checks will be cut every April 15. 
 
 If the daughters have kids and don’t work outside the house, the trustees will give them each 3 percent of the value of their trust every Jan. 1. There’s one catch: The money flows only for a “child born in wedlock.” 
 
 The sisters could earn the same amount being “a caregiver” to their mother, Ewa Laboz, 58, whom their father was in the middle of divorcing. She got nothing in the will and has indicated that she will contest it. 
 
 “It’s a way to control things from the grave,’’ said estate lawyer Jeffrey Barr, who is not involved in the case. “You don’t see a lot of it, but it happens. People do it because . . . they think it’s for the good of the children.’’ 
 
 Estate lawyer Oshrie Zak said the move is not surprising in this case. 
 
 “Accustomed to the control over others that their money affords them in life, the will is their last shot at controlling their loved ones,’’ he said of Laboz and other successful people. 
 
 Maurice Laboz signed the will in April 2014, about nine months before he died at age 77. He left behind a $37 million fortune. 
 
 He justified leaving his wife out of his will by citing a “prenuptial agreement, which limits her rights,” according to the document. 
 
 Ewa Laboz filed court papers last month contesting that, arguing she deserves a share of the pot because she was still married to her husband when he died. 
 
 The rest of Laboz’s fortune is set to go to charities, including The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research and Meals on Wheels. ||||| By Lauren Johnson 
 
 Manhattan landlord Maurice Laboz’ Regal Real Estate has sold close to $40 million worth of real estate in a series of deals with The Lam Group. 
 
 While better known for its work in hotel development, it is expected that Lam will maintain the properties scattered across Manhattan as apartments and convert others to luxury homes. 
 
 “These are core investment properties, they just have great rates of return so you can sit there rent and manage them,” said Christopher Okada, president and owner of Okada and Company LLC, who represented The Lam Group. 
 
 In the first transaction, Regal sold the 30-unit, mixed-use building at 21-23 Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan for $14.5 million. The buyer was listed in city records as YJL Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of The Lam Group based at 202 Centre Street. 
 
 The nine-story, 37,800 s/f building has a total of 30 apartment units, all rented at open market rents, and 4,300 s/f of ground floor retail occupied by food chains, Papa John’s and Subway. Laboz bought the property in May of 2000 and for $2 million, according to city records. 
 
 Broker Jasper Socia, president of Independent Properties NYC, Inc. who represented Laboz in the sale, said the new owner plans to keep the property as a rental. Average rents in the building, according to StreetEasy.com, are $2,748 per month. 
 
 “[The building] was fully renovated in 2001, so nothing needs to be done,” noted Socia. 
 
 Socia also represented Regal Realty in the sale of 105 Chambers Street in Tribeca, a commercial condominium also known as The Cary Building, for $22 million. 
 
 Lam plans to convert the office and retail spaces, totaling some 32,000 s/f, into condominium residential units, according to Okada. 
 
 Finally, Laboz also sold 3 East 17th Street, a two-story retail property in Flatiron district, for $4.4m. The Lam Group will reconfigure and renovate the 5,400 s/f building to create ground floor retail with a three-bedroom apartment above. Okada said the cap rate for the property made the investment “like finding a gem in the sewer.” 
 
 Socia, a former Bond NY broker who founded his own firm earlier this year, is currently marketing approximately 50,000 s/f of residential and commercial properties. 
 
 “I’m young and ambitious, looking to continue on my path of selling multi-family properties throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan,” he said. 
 
 Regal Real Estate had no comment on the transactions.","– ""Want my money while you're still young? Then you have to play by my rules."" That's pretty much what deceased Manhattan real estate landlord Maurice Laboz has posthumously told his two daughters, the New York Post reports. According to his will, 17-year-old Victoria and 21-year-old Marlena will get $10 million apiece at age 35 but can only touch the dough earlier if they provide trustees with evidence of a rather traditional lifestyle. To wit: Marlena gets $500,000 for getting married, as long as the groom signs an agreement saying he won't touch the cash. She gets $750,000 more for graduating from an ""accredited university"" and writing up to 100 words on what she'll do with the money. In five years, Marlena and Victoria each receive a yearly check for 300% of their annual income. Uncle Sam will love the date when they get it: April 15. If either becomes a stay-at-home mom with kids, she gets 3% of the trust's value each year, providing the children are ""born in wedlock."" Their mother, 58-year-old Ewa Laboz, isn't so lucky: Maurice offered her nil, citing a prenuptial agreement. He was divorcing her when he died at age 77 earlier this year. How did Luboz get so loaded? Well, it's New York real estate: Just four years ago, his Regal Real Estate sold nearly $40 million in properties ""scattered across Manhattan,"" reported Rew Online at the time.

He agreed (true).""

 He later warned, ""@piersmorgan: BOOM! @rickygervais back hosting Golden Globes. Be afraid, Hollywood egos, be very afraid.” It's gonna be biblical."" 
 
 Gervais raised eyebrows at this year's telecast with his irreverent, no-holds-barred barbs at Tinseltown bigwigs such as Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp and Cher. After quipping that the HFPA were bribed to nominate the Tourist, which starred Depp and Angelina Jolie, Gervais joked: ""No, all that happened was some of them were taken to see Cher in concert. Now how was that a bribe, really? It's not, because it's not 1975."" 
 
 He also suggested that certain ""famous Scientologists"" are gay, and introduced an unamused Bruce Willis as ""Ashton Kutcher's dad."" (Kutcher is married to Willis' ex-wife, Demi Moore, and stepfather to their three children.)

 The HFPA's decision to bring back Gervais was not a total surprise, as insiders had told THR of talks between comic, NBC and the organization that hosts the Globes earlier this month. 
 
 Also, even though the HFPA refused to condone many of Gervais’ jokes, the group put out a statement following the telecast saying that overall, “the show was among the best we’ve ever had and we were pleased.” 
 
 The Globes averaged 17 million viewers on NBC, up 5 percent in demo from the year prior. 
 
 Lost creator Damon Lindelof summed up Wednesday's news via a Peanuts analogy on his Twiiter account: ""Hollywood Foreign Press = Charlie Brown. Ricky Gervais = Lucy holding the football."" 
 
 Piers Morgan also responded to Gervais' new gig by inviting him as a guest on his show once if ruffles feathers again: ""Dear @rickygervais - please can I have the first 'Sorry if I offended anyone' interview after the 2012 Golden Globes, like last time?"" 
 
 Gervais responded: ""@piersmorgan I'll escape to New York straight after. See you there."" ||||| Although — or perhaps because — he ruffled so many feathers when he hosted the Golden Globes in January, comedian Ricky Gervais will return to the podium at the annual awards gala in 2012, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. announced Wednesday.The group, composed of 83 entertainment journalists from around the world, voted Wednesday to bring back the performer for a third consecutive year, though a small but vocal minority dissented. Sixteen out of the 62 members who voted were opposed to Gervais' return, according to a person who was present at the meeting but asked not to be identified because of the confidential nature of the proceedings. In a statement on the Golden Globes website, the HFPA said the group was moved to bring back Gervais after meeting with NBC official Doug Vaughan.According to the person at the vote, the majority of the dissenters were older members who found Gervais' material in January insulting and were concerned that some of the A-list stars on the receiving end of the jokes wouldn't return for more abuse. ""My worry was that he was insulting, and when I invite someone to my house, they don't insult me,"" said longtime HFPA member Judy Solomon, who writes for an Israeli publication. ""But this is show business. I guess I'm old-fashioned.""A blog post on the HFPA site acknowledged that ""while many welcome Gervais' return, not everyone is happy with the decision because last year his blunt one-liners targeting big-name celebrities caused anger and resentment in some quarters."" The upcoming ceremony is set for Jan. 15 and will air on NBC.The Globes usually bring a certain amount of hijinks. But Gervais' performance last January was particularly barbed.""It seemed like everything was three-dimensional this year, except the characters in 'The Tourist,'"" he quipped, taking a shot at that film's stars, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, whose nominations he joked were the product of bribery. While Depp smiled grimly, Gervais moved on to laud the un-nominated ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" as being a movie in which two heterosexual men play two gay men ""so the opposite of some famous Scientologists.""And after the actor introduced Robert Downey Jr. with references to Betty Ford and correctional facilities, the ""Iron Man"" actor — who battled drug addiction and served time in prison — smiled at the audience and said: ""Aside from the fact that it's been unusually mean-spirited with mildly sinister undertones, I'd say the vibe of the show is pretty good.""Gervais also took a shot at the HFPA leadership. ""I had to help the HFPA president off the toilet and pop his teeth back in,"" he said of the then-HFPA President Philip Berk. The HFPA sent strong signals immediately after the show that it would not invite Gervais back. Berk said afterward that Gervais ""definitely crossed the line"" and that ""some of the things were totally unacceptable.""However, the members who voted for Gervais said that the actor's quips, and the buzz that came with them, in fact informed their vote.""This is a very clever decision,"" said HFPA member Gabriel Lerman, who represents Spain at the organization. ""Gervais was very funny, and we were very enthusiastic to bring him back."" Lerman did acknowledge that he thought the actor ""maybe did cross the line a few times"" with his material last year. But, he added, ""this is a night to have a good time.""The HFPA might also have been concerned that declining to bring Gervais back could lead to some unexpected competition. In September, the actor wrote on his blog that he would host a live podcast during the Golden Globes with famous friends such as Louis CK, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart and Larry David.As for Gervais, the HFPA blog post said that the actor ""dismissed the possibility of coming back for a third time, but he gradually warmed to the idea and last month met with HFPA President Dr. Aida Takla-O'Reilly in Paris to discuss it.""The Gervais issue, which comes on the heels of a host change at the Oscars from Eddie Murphy to Billy Crystal, points up the Globes' dual and at times contradictory identity. On the one hand they seek to be a far looser and less predictable affair than the Academy Awards. But they also must preserve a sense of gladhanding that comes standard at Hollywood awards events.Gervais' performance in January generated flat ratings, with the three-hour NBC telecast drawing 17 million total viewers. However, the program did dip 5% in the key category of adults ages 18 to 49, to a 5.2 rating. The curiosity or train-wreck factor could goose that number this year.A 2011 nominee who was in the Beverly Hilton ballroom in January acknowledged that the awkwardness could be felt at the ceremony. But the person also speculated that ratings may have triumphed ego. ""This is a question of which master is being served, and the network is a big one,"" said the nominee, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the relationship with the HFPA.The person added that the HFPA was in a tight spot. ""If they brought Ricky back, they knew they could face a backlash from some people in Hollywood,"" the person said. ""But if they didn't bring him back, they'd look like they didn't have a sense of humor.""","– Forget about the ""alternative"" Golden Globes hosting: Ricky Gervais is returning to host the real thing in 2012, despite having offended just about everybody at the last Golden Globes.

 Carman, 22, who grew up in Middletown and now lives in Vermont, was rescued Sunday about 100 nautical miles south of Martha's Vineyard by a passing freighter. His mother, Linda Carman, 54, of Middletown, has not been located. 
 
 The two had been in a 31-foot aluminum boat, leaving Point Judith, R.I., late on Sept. 17 for a fishing trip. They did not return as scheduled Sept. 18, and the Coast Guard searched a huge area over six days for the vessel. 
 
 Nathan Carman told the Coast Guard the boat sank Sept. 18 in deep water near Block Canyon off the coast of New York, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Nicole Groll. When he was picked up, Linda Carman was not with him, Groll said. 
 
 When the boat started taking on water he ""looked for her but did not find her,"" Groll said. 
 
 The Coast Guard had no plans to renew its search, suspended last Friday. Groll said the location Nathan Carman gave where the boat sank is in deep water where there is no feasible recovery option.

 Groll said the mother's disappearance was ""beyond the survivability window,"" a determination that takes into account time passed, water conditions, the availability of food and drinkable water, and other factors. 
 
 ""A decision to suspend a case is never easy,"" she said. ""However, we are not going to reopen the search for Linda Carman."" 
 
 Nathan Carman was found in a raft that had been part of the boat's safety equipment, Groll said. The area where the raft was found had been covered in the earlier search, she said. 
 
 ""We searched over 62,000 nautical miles. We were extremely thorough,"" Groll said. ""We searched until all possible avenues were exhausted."" 
 
 Nathan Carman, reported to be in good condition, was picked up by the freighter Orient Lucky, now heading to Boston, Groll said. The freighter is from Shandong, China, but Groll did not know its origin or destination at the time it picked him up. 
 
 The freighter will be met by Coast Guard officials when it arrives Tuesday evening, she said. 
 
 Hartford attorney Hubert Santos said his firm also plans to have someone there. 
 
 ""We are Nathan Carman's attorneys and we are trying to reach him and we plan on having someone in Boston when the boat docks,"" said Santos, who said he has previously represented Nathan Carman in another matter. 
 
 Santos said his office has contacted the U.S. Coast Guard as well as U.S. Attorney's offices in Connecticut and Massachusetts to let them know that whether ""he needs a lawyer or not"" Carman has an attorney who wants to be present before any interviews are done. 
 
 The Carmans left Port Judith, R.I., in a 32-foot aluminum boat called the Chicken Pox late on a Saturday, Sept. 17. 
 
 Nathan Carman, who grew up in Middletown and lives in Vermont, and his mother told friends they were going to Block Island to fish and would return the morning of Sept. 18. 
 
 Sharon Hartstein, Linda Carman's close friend, said Monday that family members were making arrangements to meet Nathan Carman when the Coast Guard releases him. She also said Linda Carman's family was planning to offer a reward for information about Linda and the boat ""to find out what happened."" 
 
 The search for the two began Sept. 18 and by Tuesday had expanded to an 11,000-square-mile area of the ocean, ""roughly twice the size of Connecticut,"" the Coast Guard said. 
 
 Search vessels from Maine and New York and aircraft from Cape Cod and North Carolina were involved. The Coast Guard announced Friday that it was suspending the search. 
 
 Hartstein said Nathan Carman moved to Vermont in recent years and met up with his mother regularly to go fishing off the coast. 
 
 ""Linda and Nathan go out at least monthly,"" she said. ""They like to fish."" 
 
 Hartstein said the two usually leave the marina late at night or early in the morning — sometimes 2 or 3 a.m. — to fish. 
 
 Hartstein said Carman's sisters were communicating regularly with the Coast Guard, and Hartstein has also been in touch with Clark Carman, Nathan's father and Linda's ex-husband, who lives in California.

 BOSTON, Mass. -- The U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed that one of two Middletown missing boaters has been found alive. 
 
 Nathan Carman was found Sunday drifting at sea by a freighter. He was in good condition and was coming back to an undisclosed port. There was no information about the whereabouts of his mother, Linda. 
 
 The Coast Guard in Boston says Nathan Carman was found by a freighter on Sunday about 100 nautical miles south of Martha's Vineyard. 
 
 “Good to go,” Coast Guard representatives in Boston said. He was not suffering from life threatening injuries, which is why he’s staying on the freighter. 
 
 He was found on a four person inflatable life raft that is required safety equipment 
 
 The family has been notified. 
 
 Saturday night, friends held a vigil for the Carman's at Linda's home. 
 
 For about a week, the Coast Guard searched roughly 60,000 square miles for Linda Carman and her son Nathan. 
 
 Last Sunday at 6:30 p.m., the Coast Guard got a report that Linda Carman, 54, and her son Nathan, 22, both from Middletown, Connecticut, didn't return from an offshore fishing trip. They were due back Sunday at 9 a.m., a friend of Linda's said. 
 
 Nathan now lives in Vermont, but grew up in Middletown. They left from Ram's Point Marina in Point Judith, Rhode Island on Saturday evening. According to Monte Montegrio, a friend of Linda's who also lives with her, Linda and Nathan frequently meet up to go fishing since Nathan moved out, and the pair are very experienced fishers. They've traveled as far as Alaska for fishing trips in the past. 
 
 Nathan has Aspberger's syndrome and previously went missing in 2011 after the loss of his beloved horse. He was found in Virginia a few days later and was unharmed. 
 
 After that incident, Gov. Dan Malloy declared August 23 ""Missing Persons Day"" in the state to support families of those who have disappeared. The day was in honor of Nathan, as well as Isabella Oleschuck, another person who went missing but was found safe in 2011. The Office of the Victim Advocate said the day is intended to remind people that you do not have to wait 24 hours to file a missing persons report. ||||| BLOCK ISLAND, R.I.

On Sunday, however, a freighter about 100 miles south of Martha's Vineyard picked up Nathan in a four-person inflatable raft.

 Even the head of Mitt Romney's campaign in Wisconsin says that he knows voters are too distracted to pay much attention to the April 3 vote. 
 
 ""People are not focused on the presidential,"" said Ted Kanavas, a former state senator and Romney's campaign co-chair. ""They are totally focused on the recall because truthfully they should be."" 
 
 Thus, with the election only a little more than a week away, Wisconsin is a black hole in a race that has been fiercely contested coast to coast since January, a sharp contrast to the recent contests in other Midwestern states like Michigan and Ohio. 
 
 Volunteers working on the national campaign are few and far between. About 30 times more Republican activists are tied up helping Walker win his recall race than helping GOP front-runner Romney win the nomination, Kanavas estimates. Romney's campaign has only one office in Wisconsin, compared to the 21 opened by Walker. 
 
 Even Republican voters who are usually interested in politics say they don't care about the primary, in which Romney, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul will compete for the state's 42 delegates. 
 
 ""I don't think anybody looks forward to more politics,"" said Travis Winder, 33, of Fitchburg. He added, ""I'm looking forward to the primary being over and the presidential race being over."" 
 
 The recall election is likely to be held in June. The campaign over Walker's fate has been going on for months, with television advertising, mailings and maneuvering over the mechanics of the recall process. Organized labor and Democratic critics targeted Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and four Republican state senators after Walker won approval from the GOP-controlled Legislature for effectively ending collective bargaining for most public employees. 
 
 The fight over the legislation prompted demonstrations of up to 100,000 people at the state Capitol last winter, and made Wisconsin the focus of the national fight over labor rights. 
 
 Walker has run television ads almost nonstop since mid-November when the recall petitions first hit the street. 
 
 State Rep. Robin Vos said Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus asked him a couple weeks ago about the chatter in the state about the upcoming presidential primary. 
 
 ""And I said, `Reince, I hate to burst your bubble, but nobody in Wisconsin is talking about the presidential primary,'"" Vos said. 
 
 Other Wisconsin races have also been overshadowed, including the contest for an open U.S. Senate seat. 
 
 ""The upcoming recall election has taken everything else off the map,"" said Mike McCabe, director of the independent watchdog group the Wisconsin Democracy campaign. 
 
 Bob Anderson, 61, a welder from Coon Valley in western Wisconsin, said he plans to vote in the primary, probably for Romney, but has been too distracted by the Walker recall to think about the race. 
 
 Of the recall, he said, ""You kind of want to get that thing done first, then worry about the rest."" 
 
 So far, the presidential candidates haven't helped raise their profiles. They haven't campaigned in the state and the first television ads, coming from Romney's super PAC Restore Our Future, didn't start airing until March. That PAC has spent more than $2 million on ads in Wisconsin while Rick Santorum has only been able to answer with about $50,000. With primary contests stacked up close together on the election calendar this year, candidates sometimes haven't made many personal appearances in a state until right before a vote. 
 
 To avoid alienating any Republicans, Walker hasn't endorsed one of the presidential candidates. 
 
 ""With this recall, I can't afford to be focused on anything but that,"" Walker told the Associated Press. ||||| A recall election was officially ordered Friday against embattled first-term Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker after more than 900,000 signatures were collected on petitions to force a vote. 
 
 The Government Accountability Board voted 5-0 to order the recall, a move that has been expected for weeks given the high number of signatures gathered between November and January. It took 540,208 signatures to trigger a recall. 
 
 Assuming a Democratic primary is necessary, it will be May 8. The actual recall vote then will be June 5. Three Democrats already have announced they are running and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, whom Walker defeated in 2010, has said he would announce his intentions before Tuesday. 
 
 There have been only two successful gubernatorial recalls in U.S. history, against California Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 and North Dakota Gov. Lynn Frazier in 1921. 
 
 Walker was targeted for recall after he pushed through a law last year that effectively ended collective bargaining rights for most state workers. It also forced the workers to contribute more to their pension and health care costs, which amounted to a cut in pay. 
 
 Walker argued the changes were needed to help balance the state's budget, while Democrats and other opponents said the true intention was to weaken the power of unions, which have traditionally opposed Republicans. 
 
 A passionate fight ensued in Wisconsin, the first state to enact a comprehensive collective bargaining law in 1959 and the birthplace of the national union representing all non-federal public employees. 
 
 Protests raged for weeks and grew as large as 100,000 people. But Walker and Republicans who controlled the Legislature never wavered and they passed the law even though all 14 Senate Democrats fled to Illinois in a failed attempt to block it. ||||| Despite conservatives' fears of an army of Mickey Mouses and Adolf Hitlers signing recall petitions against Gov. Scott Walker, elections officials found only five fake names and nearly 901,000 valid signatures collected to recall the Republican governor — far more than enough needed for the election to go forward. 
 
 The state Government Accountability Board is scheduled to meet Friday morning to vote on the findings of board staff and set dates for the recall elections. 
 
 GAB staff said in a memo released Thursday that 900,938 valid signatures were collected on petitions seeking to recall Walker, and about 808,990 were gathered on those seeking to recall Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. The minimum needed to trigger a recall was 540,208 signatures for each of them. 
 
 If the board orders elections on Friday as expected, recall primary elections — if necessary — are expected to be held on May 8, followed by a June 5 general election. At least three Democrats are running for governor, and another three have said they are running for lieutenant governor, making primaries likely. Four Republican senators also face recall. 
 
 Recall organizers began circulating petitions in mid-November and submitted the signatures in mid-January. Elections officials were granted two extensions to review the signatures, a task that was conducted at a for-a-time-undisclosed state facility in Madison under tight security. The findings from the GAB's review was reported in Thursday's memo. 
 
 Elections officials said that during that review they found just five fake names of the 931,053 submitted on the Walker petitions: Adolf Hitler, Mick E. Mous, Donald L. Duck, Fungky Van Den Elzen, and I Love Scott Walker Thanks. 
 
 Staff also identified 4,001 duplicate names, and struck 26,109 incomplete signatures. Staff recommended striking just over 30,000 signatures from Walker's petitions, or about 3 percent of the total number of signatures submitted. Similarly, they suggested striking about 33,000 signatures from Kleefisch petitions because of duplicates or incomplete signatures. 
 
 Several other names that GAB staff members flagged as potentially fictitious were found in the statewide voter registration database or telephone directories, including Princess High and Mohammed Ali, the memo said. 
 
 If Walker loses the election, Walker would be the first Wisconsin governor, and only the third governor in the United States, to be recalled. He would join California Gov. Gray Davis and North Dakota Gov. Lynn Frazier. 
 
 ""This was the greatest petition campaign in American history for a reason: Scott Walker's radical overreach and abuse of power,"" said Graeme Zielinski, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. ""Tomorrow will be a day for sober reflection on the work done and the great work left to do to restore Wisconsin's values."" 
 
 But Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews said the governor was expecting this and is ready to defend his record. 
 
 ""We have long said that we anticipated the election process would move forward,"" she said. ""Gov. Walker looks forward to contrasting his record of laying the foundation for a more successful Wisconsin while moving the state forward against the Democrats' failed policies."" 
 
 The board has already found enough valid signatures were collected on petitions that aim to recall four Republican state senators: Scott Fitzgerald, Van Wanggaard, Terry Moulton, and Pam Galloway. Galloway has resigned from the Senate, citing illnesses in her family. 
 
 The senators' recall elections would be on the same two dates — May 8 and June 5 — as the Walker and Kleefisch recalls. 
 
 Candidates wishing to run have until April 10 to file nomination papers.","– And the state's elections board makes it official: The recall election against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has been ordered, the AP reports. Mick E. Mous, Donald L. Duck, and Adolf Hitler have been scratched, but almost all the other 900,000 signatures on a petition to recall Wisconsin's controversial Republican governor have been declared genuine, clearing the way for a June 5 election. At least three Democrats are running to replace Scott Walker, and a primary will be held May 8, reports the Wisconsin State Journal. The state's lieutenant governor and four Republican state senators also face recall. If Democrats succeed in ousting Walker, he will be only the third governor in US history to be recalled. ""This was the greatest petition campaign in American history for a reason: Scott Walker's radical overreach and abuse of power,"" said a Democratic Party spokesman. A Walker campaign spokeswoman says the governor is ready to defend his record. The recall battle has been such a prominent issue in Wisconsin that even Republican activists say they haven't been paying much attention to the state's April 3 primary, AP notes.",<pad> Wisconsin's recall race.</s>,0.030303029574150615,0.0,0.030303029574150615
279,"That pioneer of bawdy literature, Giovanni Boccaccio, inspired Shakespeare's ""All's Well that Ends Well"" with one tale from the hundred stories in his erotic tapestry of 14th-century Italian life, ""The Decameron."" 
 
 Will all end as well for Woody Allen? The auteur Bill Murray so memorably dubbed the Wood-man has announced his “Bop Decameron” with a cast led by Allen himself, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penélope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, Ornella Muti, Alison Pill and Ellen Page. 
 
 Allen will make it in Rome starting in July. In more ways than one, he's following in the footsteps of Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica, and Luchino Visconti, who contributed sections to the 1962 anthology film, ""Boccaccio '70."" 
 
 Let's hope travel continues to be rejuvenating for Allen. 
 
 One reason his smash romantic comic fantasy, ""Midnight in Paris,"" is so appealing is that it echoes Allen's youthful prose larks -- not just ""A Twenties Memory"" but also ""If the Impressionists Had Been Dentists."" 
 
 This ""fantasy exploring the transposition of temperament"" takes the shape of a series of letters from dentist Vincent (van Gogh) to his brother Theo -- letters like, ""Dear Theo, Toulouse-Lautrec is the saddest man in the world. He longs more than anything to be a great dentist, and he has real talent, but he's too short to reach his patients' mouths and too proud to stand on anything.""(The letters end with, ""Sometimes I wish I had listened to father and become a painter. It's not exciting but the life is regular."") 
 
 
 
 I was delighted, not surprised, when the artists who created the poster for ""Midnight in Paris"" based it on van Gogh's ""The Starry Night."" 
 
 ||||| Woody Allen is going through a career resurgence of sorts, with his ""Midnight in Paris"" poised to attract a wider audience than any film he's directed in the past 25 years (and there have been a lot of films in those 25 years). 
 
 
 
 On Monday morning, the 75-year-old director said he'd soon make himself visible in another way. Allen confirmed in a press release that he would have a role in his new movie ""The Bop Decameron."" The film, which begins shooting in July, strings together several romantic vignettes in Rome, the filmmaker's latest stop on his European tour. It attracts the usual mix of top-tier cast members (Alec Baldwin, Ellen Page, Penelope Cruz, Jesse Eisenberg -- indeed, is there an actor who was born to star in a Woody Allen movie more than Jesse Eisenberg?). 
 
 ""Decameron"" will mark the first time that Allen has starred in one of his own movies since ""Scoop"" five years ago, and it's hard not to notice a parallel. Back when that movie was being made the director was also undergoing a career revival, his darkly psychological ""Match Point"" garnering what at the time was his biggest audience in nearly two decades. 
 
 
 
 It's impossible to know the degree of connection between the popularity of ""Midnight in Paris"" and his willingness to again appear in front of the camera. But his return to acting certainly comes at an opportune time, with filmgoer goodwill for Allen higher than it's been in a long while. 
 
 
 
 Of course, Woody doesn't go away even when he goes away. In ""Midnight,"" Owen Wilson's Gil Pender channels Woody, and Larry David two years ago played the Woody character to the hilt in ""Whatever Works."" Coming after all those stand-ins, the sight of Allen on the big screen will provide a fitting metaphor for his current career status: Just when you think he's disappeared, you realize he's been here all along.

 Bode Miller and his wife, Morgan, continue to grieve over the drowning of their 19-month-old daughter, but the couple have opened up about the tragedy’s painful details to prevent similar heartbreak from striking other parents. 
 
 ""There's not a day that goes by that I don't pray for the opportunity to go back to that day and make it different. But now we have this opportunity to make other parents' days different,"" an emotional Morgan Miller told TODAY’s Savannah Guthrie in the couple’s first public interview since the accident. 
 
 ""We have the choice to live our days with purpose, to make sure that no other parent has to feel what we're feeling."" 
 
 The Millers lost their youngest child, Emeline “Emmy” Miller, on June 10 after she fell into a neighbor's pool. The morning before she died started just like most others. 
 
 “It was a normal day. Every morning, the kids would go swimming and Bode would go swimming with them, and they'd be in there for hours. And they loved it,” Morgan said. 
 
 The family then headed out to a birthday party before Morgan and Emmy spent the afternoon visiting with friends and grandparents. They returned home to say goodbye to Bode before he took his oldest daughter to her softball game. 
 
 ""He was loading up the car when we got back and I gave him a kiss. And out of nowhere, she (Emmy) leaned over and gave him another kiss. And we were so amused by her reaction because it was not typical of Emmy,” Morgan recalled tearfully. “So I kissed him again and she did it again and we laughed. Then I turned around and I walked inside and she waved and said bye to her Dad.” 
 
 Morgan then walked her kids next door to visit with their neighbors. 
 
 ""We go over, back and forth, multiple times a week. They're family to us,” she said. “And it was just a normal day over there. We sat on the sofa and she played in front of us.” 
 
 Morgan sipped tea while the boys played nearby. 
 
 “And Emmy would go back and forth, which was all of 15 feet. And all of the sudden, it was just too quiet for me,” Morgan recalled. “We're in mid-conversation and I stood up. And I turned and I went right to where the boys were and I said ‘Where's Emmy?’” 
 
 But Morgan knew before anyone answered. 
 
 “Before Nate could respond, I turned around and the door that leads to the back yard, that was closed, had this tiny sliver of light coming through the side,” Morgan said. “And my heart sank and I opened the door and she was floating in the pool. And I ran and I jumped in."" 
 
 Morgan pulled Emmy out of the water and started CPR while her neighbor called 911. An ambulance rushed the baby to the hospital. 
 
 Doctors initially told the Millers that their daughter might survive, but the outlook soon changed. 
 
 “The doctor said her brain had just not had enough oxygen for too long of a time,"" Bode said. 
 
 In their grief, the couple learned that drowning is the leading cause of unintentional death for children 1- to 4-years old. 
 
 ""It's the number one way that you could potentially lose your kid. If it's number one for me, I want to know about it,” Bode said. 
 
 ""I've been to all the pediatrician's meetings and check-ups on our kids. And I can't say it's come up one time. Not a single time."" 
 
 The Millers had already enrolled their older children in drowning prevention classes and installed a fence around their pool before moving into their own home. They did everything they thought they were supposed to do. 
 
 “Guilt is a very painful thing,” Morgan said. “And even though it's awful and living with it is terrible, and I hope and pray and beg that it gets easier, I am now much more aware in that area to make sure it doesn't ever happen again."" 
 
 The couple now try to move forward with a mission to help others to be more vigilant, in memory of Emmy. 
 
 ""She was just a bear. She had such a powerful bull-like personality where she just did what she wanted,” Bode said. 
 
 They say their three other children help guide them through their darkest moments. 
 
 ""When they talk about her and share stories, they always have a smile on their face,” Morgan said. “And they constantly remind us we're still here. And it allows us to bring our focus back to the things we still have to be incredibly grateful for."" 
 
 The couple are expecting another child this fall, a blessing that brings mixed emotions. 
 
 ""That was my first concern,"" Morgan said. ""Besides the fact of never being able to see my daughter again, it was, every time, how am I supposed to bring a new baby into this world without — with just losing my baby?"" 
 
 Emmy had looked forward to being a big sister, her mother recalled. 
 
 ""She walked around all the time with her baby. And now we have the opportunity to get to love that baby not only for ourselves, but for Emmy,” Morgan said. ""She was such a bright light and she was determined."" 
 
 Bode said it wasn’t an easy decision to open up about such a recent loss. 
 
 ""It's an obligation to some degree,” he said. “I think it does, in some way, help to heal a little bit. That maybe we're preventing it from happening to somebody else.” 
 
 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) urges parents to ""never — even for a moment — leave children alone near open bodies of water, such as lakes or swimming pools, nor near water in homes (bathtubs, spas),"" the group said on its website. 
 
 ""Parents should learn CPR and keep a telephone and emergency equipment (i.e., life preservers) at poolside."" 
 
 AAP also suggests that every home pool be surrounded by a fence to prevent a child from unsupervised access from the house. The group warns that “there is no substitute for at least a four-foot-high, nonclimbable, four-sided fence with a self-closing, self-latching gate.”","– The day before Bode and Morgan Miller's daughter died ""was a normal day,"" Morgan Miller recalls in a new interview with Today. Bode took their kids swimming; the family went to a birthday party. Morgan took 19-month-old Emmy to visit friends and grandparents, then returned home to say goodbye to Bode as he took his oldest daughter to a softball game; the couple laughed as Emmy uncharacteristically kissed her father goodbye multiple times. Then Morgan took the other kids next door. ""We go over, back and forth, multiple times a week. They're family to us,"" she says of their neighbors. ""And it was just a normal day over there. We sat on the sofa and [Emmy] played in front of us,"" going back and forth over a span of about 15 feet in the room. Then, mid-conversation, as Morgan sipped her tea, she suddenly realized it was too quiet.

""And my heart sank and I opened the door and she was floating in the pool. And I ran and I jumped in."" Doctors could not save the toddler, and she died the following day. Now, the Millers say they feel obligated to speak out in an effort to spread awareness of drowning dangers and spare other parents the same pain. After learning that drowning is the leading cause of accidental death for children ages 1 to 4, Bode Miller says they wondered why it isn't talked about more: ""I've been to all the pediatrician's meetings and check-ups on our kids. And I can't say it's come up one time. Not a single time,"" he says. ""It's the number one way that you could potentially lose your kid.

281,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it would soon send a missile defense system to Guam to defend it from North Korea, as the U.S. military adjusts to what Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has called a ""real and clear danger"" from Pyongyang. 
 
 At the same time, North Korea repeated its threat to launch a nuclear attack on the United States. Pyongyang said it had ratified a potential strike because of U.S. military deployments around the Korean peninsula that it claimed were a prelude to a possible nuclear attack on the North. 
 
 Washington had been informed of the potential attack by North Korea, a spokesman for its army said in a statement carried by the English language service of state news agency KCNA. It was unclear how such a warning was given since North Korea does not have diplomatic ties with Washington. 
 
 Experts say North Korea is years away from being able to hit the continental United States with a nuclear weapon, despite having worked for decades to achieve nuclear-arms capability. 
 
 North Korea has previously threatened a nuclear strike on the United States and missile attacks on its Pacific bases, including in Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific. Those threats followed new U.N. sanctions imposed on the North after it carried out its third nuclear test in February. 
 
 ""Some of the actions they've taken over the last few weeks present a real and clear danger,"" Hagel told an audience at the National Defense University in Washington. 
 
 U.S. stocks sank to their lows of the day after Hagel's comments and the Guam deployment news. 
 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly dropped below 1.8 percent for the first time since January as investors sought safety in government bonds, driving their prices higher. The dollar strengthened modestly against the euro and yen. 
 
 The South Korean won hit a six-month low on Wednesday. 
 
 ""I would say that people are taking it a lot more seriously than they used to,"" said Steve Van Order, a fixed income strategist at Calvert Investments in Maryland, referring to the tensions with North Korea. 
 
 Despite the rhetoric, Pyongyang has not taken any military action and has shown no sign of preparing its 1.2 million strong armed forces for war, the White House said on Monday. 
 
 That would indicate that its threats are partly intended for domestic consumption to bolster young leader Kim Jong-un ahead of celebrations marking the anniversary of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the state's founder and the younger Kim's grandfather, on April 15. 
 
 Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, criticized the latest North Korean statement. 
 
 ""It is yet another offering in a long line of provocative statements that only serve to further isolate North Korea from the rest of the international community and undermine its goal of economic development,"" Hayden said. 
 
 North Korea had ""ratified"" a merciless attack against the United States, potentially involving a ""diversified nuclear strike"", the KCNA statement concluded after railing against annual war games between South Korea and the United States that run throughout April. 
 
 ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow,"" the KCNA statement said. 
 
 HAGEL: MUST TAKE THREATS SERIOUSLY 
 
 Hagel said he had to take the threats seriously, language he has used in recent weeks as the United States has revamped its missile defense plans and positioned two guided-missile destroyers in the western Pacific to bolster missile defense. 
 
 The United States has also flexed its muscle during the military drills with South Korea, flying two radar-evading stealth bombers on a first-of-its-kind practice bombing run over South Korea. 
 
 In the latest move, the Pentagon said it was deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to Guam in the coming weeks. The THAAD system includes a truck-mounted launcher, interceptor missiles and an AN/TPY-2 tracking radar. 
 
 Last month, Hagel said the Pentagon would add 14 new anti-missile interceptors in Alaska and move ahead with the deployment of a second missile-defense radar in Japan. 
 
 Adding to tensions, North Korea on Wednesday closed access to a joint factory zone with South Korea, putting at risk $2 billion a year in trade that is vital to the impoverished state. 
 
 It said on Tuesday it would revive a mothballed nuclear reactor able to produce bomb-grade plutonium. 
 
 Hagel called America's responses so far ""measured, responsible, serious"" and also said the United States was working with allies to lower tensions. 
 
 ""We are doing everything we can, working with the Chinese, others to defuse that situation on the peninsula,"" he said. 
 
 In Beijing, China's deputy foreign minister met ambassadors from the United States and both Koreas to express ""serious concern"" about the Korean peninsula, China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday. 
 
 It was a sign that China, the North's major benefactor, was increasingly worried about events spinning out of control. 
 
 (Additional reporting by David Alexander in Washington and Caroline Valetkevitch in New York. Writing by Dean Yates) ||||| SEOUL, South Korea — The United States announced Wednesday that it was speeding the deployment of an advanced missile defense system to Guam in the next few weeks, two years ahead of schedule in what the Pentagon said was “a precautionary move” to protect American naval and air forces from the threat of a North Korean missile attack. 
 
 The system — called Thaad, for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense — was scheduled for deployment around 2015. 
 
 The decision to deploy it now was the latest in a series of steps intended to deter the North from either military action or new missile tests and came only hours after the latest North Korean provocation, with officials blocking South Koreans from crossing the border to enter a jointly operated industrial park. 
 
 The North had threatened the move in reaction to taunts from the South Korean news media that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had cut hot lines and other communications across the border, but did not want to risk one of his most precious sources of hard currency. The border has been sealed before, but the move against the operations at the industrial park that employs roughly 53,000 North Koreans raised doubt about the future of the last remaining major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. 
 
 In recent weeks, the North has repeatedly threatened that, if provoked, it could target United States forces in Guam and Hawaii as well as the mainland United States — a threat it repeated Thursday. 
 
 Earlier this week, the Defense Department announced that two of the Navy’s Aegis-equipped missile defense warships were positioned in the Pacific to watch North Korea. Installing the land-based missile system in Guam will free up the ships, which have radar and interceptor missiles, to be repositioned closer to the North Korean coast. 
 
 That would give President Obama a wider range of options if the North Koreans fire their missiles in a test or at a target. 
 
 “We haven’t made any decisions,” a senior administration official said. “But we want as many options as possible.” 
 
 The last time the United States seriously prepared to shoot down North Korean missiles was the summer of 2006, when the defense secretary at the time, Donald H. Rumsfeld, ordered the Army to prepare to intercept a long-range Taepodong missile from its antiballistic missile base in Alaska during a North Korean test. But the North Korean missile broke up in flight. 
 
 Last month, as the North escalated its threats, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced that the United States would bolster long-range ballistic missile defenses in Alaska and California. But that process will take several years; the Thaad is intended to deter a threat to Guam, which is considered to be on the outer edge of the North’s missile range. The system includes a truck-mounted launcher, interceptor missiles, an integrated fire control system and advanced tracking radar. 
 
 Mr. Hagel, speaking at the National Defense University in Washington, referred to North Korea’s increased nuclear ability in response to a question from the audience. 
 
 “They have a nuclear capacity now,” he said. “They have a missile delivery capacity now. And so, as they have ratcheted up their bellicose, dangerous rhetoric, and some of the actions they have taken over the last few weeks present a real and clear danger.” 
 
 Mr. Hagel’s carefully worded comment about the North’s “nuclear capacity” was significant; on Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry insisted that the United States would never recognize the North “as a nuclear state.” The difference pointed to the administration’s dilemma: after three nuclear tests, there is no doubt the country can trigger a nuclear explosion, but the United States is adamant that it will not reward the North by accepting its arsenal as a permanent reality. 
 
 In recent days the North has said it would never negotiate away its nuclear weapons arsenal, and it has taken steps toward expanding it. It declared it would restart a nuclear reactor that gave it a small stockpile of plutonium. Photographs published Wednesday on the Web site 38 North, which follows North Korean developments, show new construction at the aging reactor, dating back several weeks. 
 
 The jointly run industrial complex, in the North Korean town of Kaesong, had continued to operate for days since the North threatened to shut it down. But on Wednesday, more than 480 South Koreans who showed up at a border crossing were denied permission to cross, said the Unification Ministry of South Korea, which is in charge of relations with the North. North Korea promised to allow 861 South Koreans currently staying in Kaesong to return home if they wished, the ministry said. But with no replacements arriving, only 33 immediately decided to return home. 
 
 Choe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Mark Landler and Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington, and Patrick Zuo from Beijing. ||||| North Korea on Wednesday barred South Korean workers from entering a jointly run factory park just over the heavily armed border in the North, officials in Seoul said, a day after Pyongyang announced it would restart its long-shuttered plutonium reactor and increase production of nuclear weapons material.

 The move to block South Koreans from going to their jobs at the Kaesong industrial complex, the last remaining symbol of detente between the rivals, comes amid increasing hostility from Pyongyang, which has threatened to stage nuclear and missile strikes on Seoul and Washington and has said that the armistice ending the 1950s Korean War is void. 
 
 Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung-suk said Pyongyang was allowing South Koreans to return home from Kaesong. Three workers returned Wednesday morning; dozens more were scheduled to return later. But Kim said about 480 South Koreans who had planned to travel to the park Wednesday were being refused entry. 
 
 North Korean authorities cited recent political circumstances on the Korean Peninsula when they delivered their decision to block South Korean workers from entering Kaesong, Kim said without elaborating. 
 
 It's the latest sign of deepening tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea said Tuesday that it will quickly begin ""readjusting and restarting"" the facilities at its main Nyongbyon nuclear complex, including the plutonium reactor and a uranium enrichment plant. Both could produce fuel for nuclear weapons. Analysts saw the statement as Pyongyang's latest attempt to extract U.S. concessions by raising fears of war. Experts estimate reactivating the reactor could take anywhere from three months to a year. 
 
 The rising tide of threats in recent weeks are seen as efforts by the North to force new policies in Seoul, diplomatic talks with Washington and to increase domestic loyalty to young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by portraying him as a powerful military commander. 
 
 North Korea is angry about ongoing South Korea-U.S. military drills and new U.N. sanctions over its Feb. 12 nuclear test, its third. The Korean Peninsula technically remains in a state of war because a truce, not a peace treaty, ended the Korean War. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea as a deterrent to North Korea. 
 
 The North's plutonium reactor began operations in 1986 but was shut down as part of international nuclear disarmament talks in 2007 that have since stalled. Tuesday's nuclear announcement underscores worries about North Korea's timetable for building a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach the United States, although it is still believed to be years away from developing that technology. 
 
 The North's rising rhetoric has been met by a display of U.S. military strength, including flights of nuclear-capable bombers and stealth jets at the annual South Korean-U.S. military drills that the allies call routine but that North Korea claims are invasion preparations. 
 
 The Kaesong industrial park started producing goods in 2004 and has been an unusual point of cooperation in an otherwise hostile relationship between the Koreas. 
 
 North and South Korea do not allow their citizens to travel to the other country without approval, but an exception had previously been made each day for the South Koreans working at Kaesong. 
 
 About 120 South Korean firms run factories in the border town of Kaesong, with 53,000 North Koreans working there. Using North Korea's cheap, efficient labor, the Kaesong complex produced $470 million worth of goods last year. 
 
 Pyongyang threatened last week to shut down the park, which is run with mostly North Korean labor and South Korean know-how. It expressed anger over South Korean media reports that said North Korea hadn't yet shut the park because it is a source of crucial hard currency for the impoverished country. 
 
 In 2009, North Korea closed its border gate in anger over U.S.-South Korean military drills, leaving hundreds of South Korean workers stranded in Kaesong for several days. The park later resumed normal operations. 
 
 ""I feel worried that I'm unable to do business and also feel anxious,"" Joe In-suk, a 54-year-old South Korean who had planned to travel to Kaesong on Wednesday, said at a border checkpoint in Paju, South Korea. About a dozen South Korean trucks were lined up at the checkpoint leading into North Korea. 
 
 If North Korea continues to deny entrance to South Korean workers, it could be tantamount to a shutdown because Kaesong factories cannot operate production lines without supplies of raw materials sent regularly by truck from the South to the North. 
 
 A South Korean manager whose company runs a factory in Kaesong was worried that buyers would drop future orders if North Korea continued to block workers and supplies from the South. 
 
 ""For some companies, today's move must have already dealt them a blow,"" the manager said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media. ""We cannot produce goods without raw material."" 
 
 Seoul's Unification Ministry urged Pyongyang to ""immediately normalize"" cross-border traffic in and out of Kaesong. 
 
 The U.S., meanwhile, called for North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions, saying it would be ""extremely alarming"" if Pyongyang follows through on a vow to restart its plutonium reactor. 
 
 White House spokesman Jay Carney said the U.S. is taking steps to ensure it has the capacity to defend itself and its allies. 
 
 But Carney noted that a string of threats from North Korea toward the U.S. and South Korea so far have not been backed up by action, calling the threats part of a counterproductive pattern. He called on Russia and China, two countries he said have influence on North Korea, to use that influence to persuade the North to change course. 
 
 U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called North Korea's development of nuclear weapons a growing threat. In a telephone call Tuesday evening to Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan, Hagel said Washington and Beijing should continue to cooperate on North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. 
 
 China, North Korea's only major economic and diplomatic supporter, expressed unusual disappointment with its ally. 
 
 Hwang Jihwan, a North Korea expert at the University of Seoul, said the North ""is keeping tension and crisis alive to raise stakes ahead of possible future talks with the United States."" 
 
 ""North Korea is asking the world, `What are you going to do about this?'"" he said. 
 
 The North's nuclear statement Tuesday suggests it will do more to produce highly enriched uranium. The technology needed to make highly enriched uranium bombs is much easier to hide than huge plutonium facilities. North Korea previously insisted that its uranium enrichment was for producing electricity _ meaning low-enriched uranium. 
 
 Kim Jin Moo, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in South Korea, said that by announcing it is ""readjusting"" all nuclear facilities, including the uranium enrichment plant, North Korea ""is blackmailing the international community by suggesting that it will now produce weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium."" 
 
 The North's plutonium reactor was disabled under a 2007 deal made at now-dormant aid-for-disarmament negotiations involving the North, the U.S., South Korea, Japan, China and Russia. 
 
 In 2008, North Korea destroyed the cooling tower at Nyongbyon in a show of commitment, but the deal later stalled after the North balked at allowing intensive international fact-checking of its past nuclear activities. North Korea pulled out of the talks after condemnation of its long-range rocket launch in April 2009. 
 
 North Korea is believed to have exploded plutonium devices in its first two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009. 
 
 There had long been claims by the U.S. and others that North Korea was also pursuing a secret uranium program. In 2010, the North unveiled to visiting Americans a uranium enrichment program at Nyongbyon. 
 
 Analysts say they don't believe North Korea currently has mastered the miniaturization technology needed to build a warhead that can be mounted on a missile, and the extent of its uranium enrichment efforts is also unclear. Some experts estimate North Korea may have enough plutonium for perhaps four to eight rudimentary bombs.

 An “exotic, incredibly venomous” sea snake has been spotted along the Southern California coast, and a local environmental group said the creature was brought to shore courtesy of El Niño. 
 
 At least one yellow-bellied sea snake, which lives its entire life in the ocean, was recently spotted on a beach in the Oxnard area. 
 
 The reptile typically lives in warmer tropical waters, and its appearance is probably a harbinger of El Niño, the cyclical weather phenomenon connected to warmer sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, according to Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay 
 
 The snake sighting was highlighted by the nonprofit environmental advocacy group in a blog post on Friday. 
 
 ""The Yellow-bellied Sea Snake has some of the most poisonous venom in the world, and is a descendant from Asian cobras and Australian tiger snakes,"" stated the post by Heal the Bay’s senior coastal policy manager, Dana Murray. 
 
 It’s the first time since the early 1980s that the black-and-yellow snake has been seen in California, according to Heal the Bay. The last yellow-bellied sea snake sighted was also during an El Niño phase. 
 
 Two sightings were reported in Oxnard, but it wasn’t clear if they were of the same snake, Murray said in an email. 
 
 “No need to panic,” the organization said on its Facebook page, calling the snake ""exotic"" and ""incredibly venomous."" 
 
 Anna Iker said she spotted a snake on Silver Strand Beach near Oxnard on Thursday. It was washed back out to sea, she said. 
 
 Robert Forbes also spotted a yellow-bellied sea snake, possibly the same one, on the same beach. He found it about 9 a.m. Friday, he said, and called the state wildlife department. The snake had died by the time officials arrived hours later, Forbes said. 
 
 The snake was being taken to the Museum of Natural History of Los Angeles, Forbes said. 
 
 Yellow-bellied sea snakes are extremely venomous and members of the public are advised not to touch them. 
 
 They can swim backward and forward and can stay underwater for up to three hours, according to the website CaliforniaHerps.com.

It's also the furthest north the snake has ever been reported along the Pacific Coast, according to the Los Angeles Times. In a Facebook post on the sightings, environmental nonprofit Heal the Bay says the warmer Pacific Ocean waters caused by El Niño—in addition to the rising ocean temperatures brought on by climate change—are likely the reason for the snake's migration. The state wildlife department was called after the second snake sighting—it's unclear if it was the same snake—Friday, KTLA reports. The snake died soon after, and its body was given to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. According to the Times, the yellow-bellied sea snake lives its entire life in the ocean, so if it's spotted on land it's likely sick or hurt.

284,"With House Republicans prepared to take a vote Thursday on yet another version of a plan to overhaul the 2010 Affordable Care Act, attention has been especially focused on whether Obamacare’s popular prohibition against denying coverage based on preexisting medical conditions will remain in place. Republicans, from President Trump to lawmakers pushing for the bill, insist that it remains intact, just in different form. Democrats and opponents of the bill say the guarantee is gone or greatly weakened. 
 
 Here’s a tweet by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), referring to an amendment added to the bill to attract votes. 
 
 VERIFIED: MacArthur Amendment strengthens AHCA, protects people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/6W7bDEO40r — Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) May 2, 2017 
 
 The reality is more nuanced and complicated, as is often the case in Washington policy debates. Despite Ryan’s tweet that people with preexisting conditions are protected, there is no guarantee that they will not face higher costs than under current law. The impact of recent tweaks to the proposed legislation is especially unclear because lawmakers are rushing ahead without an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. So here’s The Fact Checker’s guide to the debate. 
 
 What’s the issue? 
 
 Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could consider a person’s health status when determining premiums, sometimes making coverage unaffordable or even unavailable if a person was already sick with a problem that required expensive treatment. The ACA prohibited that, in part by requiring everyone to purchase insurance. 
 
 But that “individual mandate” was unpopular and Republicans would eliminate that requirement in their proposed American Health Care Act. As a replacement, the AHCA initially included a continuous coverage provision that boosted insurance rates by 30 percent for one year if he or she has a lapse in coverage. (We explored this interaction between the provisions earlier.) 
 
 As part of an effort to attract more votes, Republicans have added an amendment, crafted by Rep. Tom McArthur (R-N.J.), that instead allows states to seek individual waivers from the law. One possible waiver would replace the continuous coverage provision so that insurance companies for one year could consider a person’s health status when writing policies in the individual market. Another possible waiver would allow the state to replace a federal essential benefits package with a more narrowly tailored package of benefits, again limited to the individual and small-group markets. 
 
 The theory is that removing sicker people from the markets and allowing policies with skimpier options would result in lower overall premiums. 
 
 Who would be affected? 
 
 If the law passed, a person generally would not be affected unless they lived in a state that sought a waiver. Moreover, they would need to have a lapse in health coverage for longer than 63 days and they would need to have a preexisting condition. Finally, they would have to purchase insurance in the individual market – such as the health exchanges in Obamacare – that currently serves about 18 million Americans. 
 
 Someone who got their insurance from an employer – and that’s about half of Americans under 65 (155 million) – presumably would not be affected, though the CBO did project that under the initial version of the AHCA 7 million fewer people would be covered by employers than under current law by 2026. 
 
 Then, for a period of one year, a person who fell into this category would face insurance rates that could be based on their individual condition. But states that seek a waiver are required to operate a risk mitigation program or participate in what is called an invisible risk sharing program. Alaska currently has such a program that helps cover the bills for one of 33 conditions (such as HIV/AIDS or metastatic cancer). The individual with the condition still submits bills to the insurance company, which then turns around and bills the state. But then the insurance company does not consider the cost of this care as part of its calculation for premiums to other individuals in the state. 
 
 All told, the AHCA would allot $138 billion over 10 years for a variety of funds that would seek to keep premiums lower or to assist with cost-sharing. Just this week, $8 billion over five years was added to the pot to woo wavering lawmakers, with the idea that the additional funds could be used for so-called high-risk pools. Many states had such pools to help people with preexisting conditions before the ACA. But the proposal does not require a state with a waiver to set up such a pool. 
 
 What could go wrong then? 
 
 There are many uncertainties about this path. The health insurance market has a lot of churn, so many people may experience a gap in coverage of just a few months. One estimate, by the Commonwealth Fund, indicated that 30 million adults would have had such a gap in 2016, potentially exposing them to a surcharge or being placed in a high-risk pool. On top of that, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27 percent of the people in the individual market have existing conditions that would have been uninsured before the ACA. 
 
 The AHCA eliminates cost sharing and offers a stingier tax credit to defray premium costs, likely resulting in higher overall health costs that may make insurance unaffordable for many people. (The CBO projected that 24 million more people would be without health insurance than under current law by 2026.) 
 
 Then, if people get sick, they may suddenly find themselves for a year being priced on their illness if they live in a state that sought a waiver. Depending on the approach taken by a state, some people might find it difficult to keep up their coverage for a full year before they qualify for prices at the community rate. 
 
 A big question is whether the funding to cover these folks is adequate. High-risk pools were big money losers and underfunded in the pre-Obamacare days, even though many had restrictions, high premiums and waiting lists. A $5 billion federal pool, established by the ACA as a bridge to the creation of the exchanges in 2013, covered about 100,000 people but was suspended when it ran out of money. 
 
 The Center for American Progress, a left-leaning group that opposes the AHCA, produced an analysis that indicated that even with the additional $8 billion, the maximum enrollment the AHCA’s funds would cover is about 700,000 people. If just 5 percent of the people currently in the individual market ended up in high-risk pools – and all states sought a waiver – that would overwhelm the proposed funding. 
 
 Avalere Health, a consulting firm, said in an analysis that $23 billion is specifically allocated in the bill for helping people with pre-existing conditions. That would cover about 110,000 people. If states allocated all of the other available funding, that would cover 600,00 people. “Approximately 2.2 million enrollees in the individual market today have some form of pre-existing chronic condition,” the analysis said. 
 
 When states had high-risk pools, people in those pools represented just 2 percent of the non-group health insurance participants. But given the limitations of those funds, that percentage may not be a good guide for what would happen under the AHCA. 
 
 Whenever health-care laws are changed, there are unknown and unintended consequences. The current system does not take into account a person’s health status when assessing premiums. But, as a Brookings Institution analysis suggested, under the AHCA’s provisions, healthy people might have an incentive to join plans based on health status. That would leave sicker people in the community rated plans, which in turn would face higher premiums. Over time, that could make the community rating meaningless. (Update: The CBO in its revised report on the AHCA said this was quite possible for states representing about one-sixth of the U.S. population. We explored that in detail in this article.) 
 
 Another possible outcome: If the pool of money is used to pay insurance companies for the difference in costs for patients with preexisting conditions, there may be little incentive for companies to keep their prices low; the difference would be made up by U.S. taxpayers. 
 
 The Bottom Line 
 
 When it comes to health care, readers should be wary about claims that important changes in health-care coverage are without consequences and that people are “protected” – or that the changes will result in massive dislocation and turmoil. There are always winners and losers in a bill of this size. In this case, if the bill ever became law, much would depend on unknown policy decisions by individual states – and then how those decisions are implemented.

 The House of Representatives will vote on the American Health Care Act, the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, on Thursday in the early afternoon. House Republicans are hurtling toward a vote on a bill that is disliked by most Americans, opposed by nearly every major health care group, and not yet scored by the Congressional Budget Office. 
 
 This is an unusual situation, and a puzzling one. Republicans will vote tomorrow for a health care bill without knowing how many people it covers or how much it would cost. They risk setting themselves up for embarrassment when the numbers actually do come out and don't look good. 
 
 As leadership scrambles to whip the votes for the American Health Care Act, it's worth stepping back to ask: What the heck is the rush? 
 
 The best explanation I've found comes from my colleague Andrew Prokop. When Republicans started this year, they had a strategy to move two big policy packages, one on health care and another on tax reform. There would only be two chances to use the budget reconciliation process that allows a bill to pass with only 51 Senate votes (for complex procedural reasons explained here), so each would get one shot. 
 
 Health reform would go first, they thought, because it would be simpler. It was a legislative strategy built when the Republican health care plan looked markedly different: 
 
 They thought it would be legislatively easier to write an Obamacare repeal bill than tax reform, because they intended to put off the hard work of creating an actual replacement for Obamacare until later. This was the “repeal and delay” strategy — pass a quick repeal, set it to go into effect in a few years, and write the replacement in the meantime. But then GOP leaders encountered a problem. Their members, in both the House and the Senate, turned out to really hate the “repeal and delay” strategy, because it meant getting rid of Obamacare and its benefits without the “replacement” the party had long promised they’d offer being ready. 
 
 Republicans want to move quickly on health care so they can fit in tax reform too, another immense and complex policy lift.

 Adding to that pressure, it's also the case that this current frenzy began as Trump was nearing his 100th day as president and pressuring Congress to schedule a vote. Although the 100-day mark has come and gone, some of that residual momentum seems to have hung around. 
 
 This all explains why, in general, there is a desire to move relatively quickly. 
 
 The part that Republicans haven't explained: Why move so quickly that they don't get a score from the Congressional Budget Office? 
 
 A legislator deciding whether or not to support the American Health Care Act would likely wonder what the bill actually does. This is the role CBO has traditionally played, providing nonpartisan estimates of who would gain coverage, who would lose it, and how much the whole thing would cost. 
 
 The whole point of CBO scoring is to figure this out before you decide whether a piece of legislation is good or bad. This also gives legislators some space to make changes to parts of a bill that don't seem to work. CBO scores are meant to be a tool for legislators, a way to game out the consequences — both politically and policy-wise — of moving laws forward. 
 
 It's notable that we haven't heard one member of Congress say, ""I like the idea of this bill, but I'll wait until we see the CBO score to make up my mind."" 
 
 But so far, the CBO score has been treated as unnecessary — certainly nice to have, but not a prerequisite for holding a floor vote. Here's how Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) put it earlier today to a reporter: 
 
 Upton said he'd like to see a CBO score, like most members say, but apparently it's not a condition for him voting for the bill, which, ah. — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) May 3, 2017 
 
 There are very few people telling Republican legislators at this point that the American Health Care Act is a good bill. Basically every health care interest group you can think of – hospitals, doctors, insurers, patients — don't support it. The most recent polling data finds most voters don't like it either. There is not a CBO score that suggests this bill achieves House Republicans' objectives. 
 
 At this point, Republicans seem more concerned with moving something out of their chamber than they do with what that something is. That is a risky and potentially embarrassing move. The CBO score will come out sooner or later, and Republicans might be faced with defending a bill they don't like much at all. 
 
 Meanwhile, in Iowa: insurer threatens to leave 94 of 99 counties with no Obamacare insurer 
 
 The health insurance plan Medica announced Wednesday that it was considering pulling out of Iowa's insurance marketplace. It is the only insurer signed up to sell coverage in all the dark pink areas of the map below, from Margot Sanger-Katz at the New York Times: 
 
 In a statement, Medica said the uncertainty in Washington makes it difficult to commit to sticking with the marketplaces in 2018: 
 
 Without swift action by the state or Congress to provide stability to Iowa’s individual insurance market, Medica will not be able to serve the citizens of Iowa in the manner and breadth that we do today. We are examining the potential of limited offerings, but our ability to stay in the Iowa insurance market in any capacity is in question at this point. 
 
 It's hard to know how much of a bellwether Medica is for the rest of the Obamacare marketplaces. On the one hand, all insurers are frustrated that Congress likely won't be appropriating funding for the cost-sharing reduction subsidies. 
 
 On the other hand, Iowa seems to be a bit of an exceptional situation. There is one patient in the marketplace who reportedly has $1 million in monthly claims (you can read more about the situation here). This has made the entire state an undesirable market for health plans, which know that if they're the last man standing, they will end up with that extremely high-cost patient.

 Leadership’s decision to press ahead with the floor action means lawmakers will be voting on the bill without updated figures from their nonpartisan scorekeeper on how many people would lose coverage under the bill or how much it would cost. 
 
 Some lawmakers acknowledged that it would be helpful to have an analysis, known as a “score,” from the CBO, but said they could not wait for it.

 When asked why the vote would not wait for the score, Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) — the lead sponsor of a new amendment to the bill that might push it over the finish line — said, “Because I don’t expect it probably for a couple weeks.” 
 
 “I wish that we had it, all right?” Upton added. “I wish that we had had it in committee. I said so at the time.” 
 
 The lack of a score comes despite years of GOP attacks on Democrats for what Republicans argued was a rushed process that rammed through the Affordable Care Act in 2010. 
 
 The latest bill text was posted Wednesday, just one night before the vote. 
 
 Upton’s amendment adds $8 billion over five years aimed at helping people with pre-existing conditions afford their premiums in states that choose to repeal ObamaCare protections preventing sick people from being charged exorbitantly high premiums. 
 
 Many health policy experts doubt that $8 billion is enough money. And Upton himself said Wednesday that he doesn’t know for sure that it will be. 
 
 “Is it enough money? I don’t know,” Upton said. “That’s the question that I asked and was led to believe that $5 billion would be enough, which is why it’s $8 billion.” 
 
 He noted that “at some point, this will be scored by CBO,” and said that if the analysis finds there is not enough money, more could be added by the Senate or at another point. 
 
 The CBO also has not provided an analysis of the amendment authored by centrist Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) and Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) that lets states apply for waivers from ObamaCare provisions preventing insurers from charging sick people higher premiums and mandating minimum insurance coverage requirements so long as high-risk pools are offered. 
 
 When asked if there are concerns the process is being rushed without a CBO score and limited time to review late-breaking changes, Meadows said Republicans have waited long enough to fulfill a nearly decadelong campaign promise. 
 
 “We’ve been talking about repealing and replacing ObamaCare for seven years. That’s the first time that I’ve had anybody say that we rushed anything,” Meadows said. 
 
 At the same time, he conceded, “It’s a valid point.” 
 
 The CBO score of the underlying bill gave many moderates pause when it found that 24 million more people would become uninsured under the measure over 10 years. 
 
 Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) downplayed the notion that lawmakers didn’t have enough time to review the legislative text of the original bill or amendments authored by GOP Reps. Gary Palmer (Ala.), MacArthur and Upton. 
 
 “The bill has been out there for a while. I mean, the MacArthur amendment’s pretty short if you want to read it. The Palmer amendment’s pretty short. I assume this amendment that may be added before the final vote with the $8 billion will be short,” Harris, another Freedom Caucus member, said. 
 
 “Look, the bottom line is we’re going to deliver to the American public what we said, that premiums are actually going to go down,” he continued. 
 
 The Palmer amendment is four pages long, MacArthur’s is eight pages, and Upton’s is three pages. The original underlying bill was unveiled in March. 
 
 The lack of a CBO score isn’t the only sign of a markedly rushed process. 
 
 House GOP leaders gave themselves flexibility earlier this week to speed up consideration of the bill if they decided to bring it up for a vote. 
 
 The House voted along party lines in a Tuesday procedural vote to waive a rule requiring lawmakers to wait a day before considering a measure out of the Rules Committee, which determines how legislation is considered on the floor. 
 
 The move, known as “martial law,” is typically reserved for tight deadlines like avoiding an imminent government shutdown. 
 
 It’s highly unusual for leaders to invoke the procedure while trying to move legislation that doesn’t face a pressing need for passage, especially for something as far-reaching as healthcare reform. 
 
 If the rushed process sounds familiar, that’s because GOP leaders used the same tactics when they tried to bring the bill up for a vote in March. 
 
 As with this week, House Republicans voted to invoke martial law to speed up the floor vote. And GOP leaders also posted an amendment that would have repealed ObamaCare’s minimum insurance coverage requirements the night before they planned to vote on it. 
 
 GOP leaders ultimately canceled a vote when it became clear the legislation didn’t have the support to pass. 
 
 Thursday’s planned vote comes after years of Republicans mocking House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who was the Speaker when ObamaCare passed, for saying, “We have to pass the [healthcare] bill so that you can find out what’s in it.” 
 
 Now, on the eve of the vote on the GOP plan, Pelosi is charging that Republicans are deliberately trying to conceal the impact of their proposal. 
 
 “Forcing a vote without a CBO score shows that Republicans are terrified of the public learning the full consequences of their plan to push Americans with pre-existing conditions into the cold,” Pelosi said. 
 
 “But tomorrow, House Republicans are going to tattoo this moral monstrosity to their foreheads, and the American people will hold them accountable.”","– House Republicans promise to call a vote on their plan to replace ObamaCare on Thursday, but the Hill notes that lawmakers will cast those votes without an official estimate of how much the plan costs or how it will affect coverage for Americans. That is, the Congressional Budget Office hasn't had time to assess the American Health Care Act and score it. ""I wish that we had it, all right?"" said Rep. Fred Upton, a key figure who switched from no to yes when the White House agreed to add $8 billion for pre-existing conditions. But Upton said any such CBO estimate is probably weeks away, adding that the measure could be changed, perhaps by the Senate, at that point. At Vox, Sarah Kliff writes that the rush to vote is a risky move for the GOP. ""The CBO score will come out sooner or later, and Republicans might be faced with defending a bill they don't like much at all."" The sticking point over pre-existing conditions had threatened to derail the measure, and critics say the $8 billion amendment still won't do enough to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions will be adequately covered. An analysis by the Fact Checker blog at the Washington Post says the issue is so nuanced that the simplistic talking points coming from both sides on the issue are useless. ""If the bill ever became law, much would depend on unknown policy decisions by individual states—and then how those decisions are implemented."" Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports that even if the vote is successful, it would ""face uncertain prospects"" in the Senate. Among other things, the House bill would reduce funding for Medicaid, which provides coverage for low-income and disabled Americans.","<pad> House speaker says the law is still in place, but that it is still a'separate issue'.</s>",0.08653846011834321,0.0067340057146097745,0.0769230755029586
285,"Global fish catches are falling three times faster than official UN figures suggest, according to a landmark new study, with overfishing to blame. 
 
 Seafood is the critical source of protein for more than 2.5 billion people, but over-exploitation is cutting the catch by more than 1m tonnes a year. 
 
 The official catch data, provided by nations to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), rarely includes small-scale, sport or illegal fishing and does not count fish discarded at sea. To provide a better estimate, more than 400 researchers around the world spent a decade finding other data to fill in the gaps. 
 
 The results, published in the journal Nature Communications, show the annual catches between 1950 and 2010 were much bigger than thought, but that the decline after the peak year of 1996 was much faster than official figures. 
 
 The FAO data indicated a catch of 86m tonnes in 1996, then a decline of 0.4m tonnes per year. In contrast, the new research estimates the peak catch was 130m tonnes, but declined at 1.2m tonnes per year afterwards. 
 
 “Our results differ very strongly from those of the FAO,” said Prof Daniel Pauly, at the University of British Columbia in Canada and who led the work. “Our results indicate that the decline is very strong and is not due to countries fishing less. It is due to countries having fished too much and having exhausted one fishery after another.” 
 
 Estimating subsistence, small-scale and illegal fishing is difficult, but Pauly said his team was confident in its results which - unlike the FAO data - includes estimates of the uncertainty. “This research is not based on a few studies here and there and then extrapolation,” he said. “It is based on the results of 200 studies we have conducted for about a decade by a network of 400 people in all countries of the world.” 
 
 The researchers used many different approaches to fill in the missing data, from hotel invoices for locally bought fish in the Bahamas to information on local fish consumption. 
 
 “This work has been carefully conducted by painstaking research into the hidden underbelly of global fishing, country by country, region by region” said Prof Boris Worm, at Dalhousie University in Canada and not involved in the new research. “This was a Herculean task that no one else has ever attempted. While the results necessarily remain uncertain, they undoubtedly represent our most complete picture yet of the global state of fish catches.” 
 
 Worm said the world’s fisheries were being over-exploited but that some stocks were being sustainably managed: “Where such measures have been taken, we find that both fish and fishermen are more likely to persist into the future.” 
 
 Global fish catches rose from the 1950s to 1996 as fishing fleets expanded and discovered new fish stocks to exploit. But after 1996, few undiscovered fisheries were left and catches started to decline. “It was never really sustainable,” said Pauly. The decline since 1996 has largely been in fish caught by industrial fleets and to a lesser extent a cut in the number of unwanted fish discarded at sea. 
 
 “The fact that we catch far more than we thought is, if you like, a more positive thing,” he said. “Because if we rebuild stocks, we can rebuild to more than we thought before.” 
 
 There has been success in some places where fishing has been restricted for a few years, for example in the Norwegian herring and cod fisheries. On resumption, catches were bigger than ever. 
 
 But Pauly said: “I expect a continued decline because I don’t expect countries to realise the need to rebuild stocks. I don’t see African countries, for example, rebuilding their stocks, or being allowed to by the foreign fleets that are working there, because the pressure to continue to fish is very strong. We know how to fix this problem but whether we do it or not depends on conditions that are difficult.” 
 
 A 2015 study showed nearly 500 Chinese fishing vessels operating off west Africa, with scores of cases of illegal fishing, according to Greenpeace. Large European vessels also operate in the region. In April 2015, the EU threatened Thailand with a trade ban over illegal fishing, while in September, Greenpeace said it had identified significant pirate fishing for tuna in the Pacific. 
 
 Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York in the UK and not part of Pauly’s team, said: “This is a superb piece of research. Greater knowledge of what we have done and are still doing will help us to change for the better.” 
 
 “We can see more clearly now, for example, the immense value of fish to poor people in developing countries,” he said. “We can see how industrial fisheries from developing countries are robbing these people of livelihoods and food. We can also see, that in efforts to stem declines, we have been using more and more bycatch that was once thrown away.” ||||| Blue Marble If satellite images of Earth now seem almost routine, they never lose their ability to enthrall.

 Pale Blue Dot In contrast to earlier suppositions about our place in the firmaments, we know now that our globe is not at the center of the cosmos, and that other celestial bodies are not attached to interlaced spheres that rotate around us.

 South Pole For centuries, gaps in maps were filled by explorers who set out across land and sea, often at immense personal risk. The true nature of “Terra Australis” had long been established by the time Robert Falcon Scott and comrades stood at the South Pole on Jan. 17, 1912; but existing knowledge could not diminish the terrible toll the conditions exacted on the men. “Great God!” wrote Scott in his journal, “this is an awful place.” All five members of Scott’s polar team died before they could reach their base camp.

 Terra Australis Incognita In this copy of a 1602 map that was created on behalf of China’s Wanli emperor by Italian Matteo Ricci and collaborators, the familiar outlines of most of the world’s continents are coming into shape, although obviously many details remain unfinished. To the map’s makers, however, the likes of Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica are not even figments of the imagination, replaced instead by an enormous southern landmass. The notion of an unknown southern land – a terra australis incognita - was first mooted by Aristotle in 322 BCE; not until 1820 did Fabian von Bellingshausen become the first man to see the Antarctic continent. 
 
 Lenox Globe It is popularly believed that ancient cartographers filled in unknown and unexplored areas of the world with the phrase ‘Here be dragons’. In fact, only one known ancient map – the so-called Lenox Globe, which is believed to date to around 1510 - displays the phrase ‘HC SVNT DRACONES’, from the Latin “hic sunt dracones.” (The phrase is written near the equator on the eastern cost of Asia.) Some nineteenth-century writers, however, believed that it referred, not to dragons, but to the ‘Dagroians’, a people who “feasted upon the dead and picked their bones.” PHOTOS: Sea Monsters Real & Imagined 
 
 Flat Earth The Greek philosopher Aristotle determined that Earth was spherical and not flat almost 2,500 years ago. The notion of a flat earth retained at least a few die-hard devotees for a surprisingly long time. For example, this 1893 map by Orlando Ferguson, recently acquired by the Library of Congress, cites “Scripture that condemns the globe theory” and promotes a book that “knocks the globe theory clean out.” ANALYSIS: What if Earth Were a Cube? 
 
 Celestial Spheres In his 2nd century treatise, the ""Almagest,"" Claudius Ptolemy proposed an explanation for the apparent movement of stars and planets, in which Earth was central and immovable, and surrounded by, at progressively greater distances, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and a sphere of ‘fixed stars.’ This geocentric view of the cosmos did not meet its first real challenge until Copernicus proposed that the planets revolved around the Sun, and Galileo used his telescope to observe the phases of Venus.

The Apollo missions enabled humanity to see for the first time our planet as it appears from space.

Everything I'd ever known could be hidden behind my thumb.” As we approach Earth Day on April 22, we look at the efforts of people throughout the ages to explore, understand and portray our world and its place in the Universe. 
 
 Global fish catches are significantly higher than official reports, and declines in fish stocks are greater than have been previously estimated, according to a new study. 
 
 Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Daniel Pauly and Dirk Zeller of the Sea Around Us project at the University of British Columbia conclude that the annual global fish catch is roughly 109 million metric tons, about 30 percent higher than the 77 million officially reported in 2010 by more than 200 countries and territories. This means that 32 million metric tons of fish goes unreported every year, “more than the weight of the entire population of the United States.” 
 
 These new figures show that overfishing worldwide is greater than had previously been thought, the authors say. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the global marine fish catch peaked in 1996 at 86 million metric tons, before declining slightly to its present level; the new study argues that the peak catch, in 1996, was in fact 130 million metric tons and has been declining, on average, by 1.2 million metric tons per year.

 “The world is withdrawing from a joint bank account of fish without knowing what has been withdrawn or the remaining balance,” Pauly said. 
 
 One of the reasons for the discrepancy in the catch figures, Pauly and Zeller say, is that official totals greatly underestimate the size of artisanal and subsistence fisheries worldwide. To their surprise, they found that these accounted for 25 percent of total catches; they slightly increased over the study period as more people participated. The bulk of the decline over the last 20 years, however, was due to decreases in industrial fisheries. 
 
 “Our results indicate that the declining is very strong and the declining is not due to countries fishing less,” Pauly said during a teleconference to announce the study. “It is due to the countries fishing too much and having exhausted one fish after the other.” 
 
 Oceans Valued at $24 Trillion: Here’s the Breakdown 
 
 The study arose from skepticism over the completeness of FAO figures, largely due to the fact that they rely on national governments reporting their own tallies, which for political or other reasons they might not always be disposed to do accurately. 
 
 Furthermore, when nations reported “no data,” that would “later be turned into a zero, which is a bad estimate of the catch of an existing fishery.” Over the course of a decade, Pauly, Zeller and their team scoured existing records dating back to 1950, delved into colonial archives, consulted with 400 researchers around the globe and even pored through receipts and invoices. 
 
 FAO has pushed back against the findings; in an email to Christopher Pala at Science Magazine, Marc Taconet, chief of FAO’s Fishery Statistics and Information Branch in Rome stated that, “we express reservations that the paper’s conclusions of declining catch trends can be strongly opposed to FAO’s reports of stable capture production trends in recent years.” 
 
 He did, however, “concur with the paper’s call upon countries’ responsibilities for improving reporting and for mobilizing funding resources.” 
 
 Some of the solutions Pauly and Zeller propose for improving the quality of records include better funding to enable FAO to support its member countries, and asking those countries to file separate figures for industrial and artisanal fisheries and to provide both documented and, when data are poor, estimated catches. 
 
 However, they note that while such moves would improve records, catches will continue to decline unless there are more widespread efforts to impose fishing caps and rebuild stocks. ||||| Catch reconstruction principles 
 
 The catch reconstruction approach rests on two basic principles16: 
 
 When ‘no data are available’ on a fishery that is known to exist, it is not appropriate to enter ‘NA’ or ‘no data’ into the database. Such entries will later be turned into a zero, which is a bad estimate of the catch of an existing fishery. This concern about the problematic ‘elegance of the number zero’ is also something that affects other scientific activities, such as climate modelling 43 ; 
 
 ; Rather, a best estimate should be inserted in all such cases, based on the fact that fishing is a social activity that is bound to throw a ‘shadow’ on the society in which it is embedded, and from which an approximate and conservative (but better than zero) estimate of catch can be derived if fishing of this type is known to occur (for example, from the seafood or the fuel consumed locally, or the number of vessels engaged in fisheries and the average catch rate of vessels of this type and so on). 
 
 This approach addresses an inherent negative bias in national and, by extension, global catch data, although considerable uncertainty in catch data is likely to remain. 
 
 Notably, when doing reconstructions, it became apparent that the perception of ‘no data’ being available was not always correct: the ‘social shadow’ yields hundreds of articles in the peer-reviewed and report literature with catch data, or data from which catch rates could be inferred, even for remote islands10. Also, countries may sometimes send to FAO a stripped down version of the national catch data their fisheries research institutes actually possess, and may even publish on their websites. 
 
 What is covered here are both ‘coastal’ waters, defined as the waters within the EEZ (Supplementary Fig. 1) that countries have claimed since this was allowed under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), or which they could claim under UNCLOS rules, but have not (such as many countries around the Mediterranean), and the open oceans, or High Seas, that is, the waters beyond national jurisdiction (that is, beyond the EEZs). The delineations provided by the Flanders’ Marine Institute (VLIZ, see www.vliz.be) are used for our definitions of EEZs. Countries that have not formally claimed an EEZ are assigned areas equivalent to EEZs based on the basic principles of EEZs as outlined in UNCLOS (that is, 200 nm and/or mid-line rules). Note that we (a) include territorial waters within our EEZs; and (b) treat disputed zones (that is, EEZ areas claimed by more than one country) as being ‘owned’ by each claimant with respect to their fisheries catches. We treat EEZ areas prior to each country’s year of EEZ declaration as ‘EEZ-equivalent waters’ (with open access to all fishing countries during that time). If the year of EEZ declaration could not be determined (and for ‘EEZs’ that were derived by us for non-claimant countries), we assign the year 1982 as declaration year, that is, the year of conclusion of UNCLOS. 
 
 We use different catch reconstruction approaches for EEZs (40% of the global ocean), and High Seas (60%), where the catches are mainly large pelagic fishes (notably tuna). Note that we also exclude the Caspian Sea from all considerations. 
 
 Domestic catch reconstruction method 
 
 Reconstructing time series of fisheries catch for all countries of the world from 1950 (the first year that FAO published its ‘Yearbook’ of global fisheries statistics) to 2010 was undertaken by fisheries ‘sectors’. However, because a standardized global definition of fishing sectors based on vessel size does not exist (for example, a vessel considered large-scale (industrial) in a developing country may be considered small-scale (artisanal) in developed countries), reconstructions utilize each country’s individual definitions for sectors, or a regional equivalent. These are described in each country reconstruction publication underlying this work. We consider four sectors: 
 
 Industrial: large-scale fisheries (using trawlers, purse-seiners, longliners) with high capital input into vessel construction, maintenance and operation, and which may move fishing gear across the seafloor or through the water column using engine power (for example, demersal and pelagic trawlers), irrespective of vessel size. This corresponds to the ‘commercial’ sectors of countries such as the USA; Artisanal: small-scale fisheries whose catch is predominantly sold (hence they are also ‘commercial fisheries’), and which often use a large variety of generally static or stationary (passive) gears. Our definition of artisanal fisheries relies also on adjacency: they are assumed to operate only in domestic waters (that is, in their country’s EEZ). Within their EEZ, they are further limited to a coastal area to a maximum of 50 km from the coast or to 200 m depth, whichever comes first. This area is defined as the Inshore Fishing Area (IFA)44. Note that the definition of an IFA assumes the existence of a small-scale fishery, and thus unpopulated islands, although they may have fisheries in their EEZ (which by our definition are industrial, whatever the gear used), have no IFA; Subsistence: small-scale non-commercial fisheries whose catch is predominantly consumed by the persons fishing it, and their families (this may also include the ‘take-home’ fraction of the catch of commercial fishers, which usually by-passes reporting systems); and Recreational: small-scale non-commercial fisheries whose major purpose is enjoyment. 
 
 In addition to the reconstructions by sector, we also assign catches to either ‘landings’ (that is, retained and landed catch) or ‘discards’ (that is, discarded catch), and label all catches as either ‘reported’ or ‘unreported’ with regards to national and FAO data. Thus, reconstructions present ‘catch’ as the sum of ‘landings’ plus ‘discards’. 
 
 Discarded fish and invertebrates are generally assumed to be dead, except for the US fisheries where the fraction of fish and invertebrates reported to survive is generally available on a per species basis45. Due to a distinct lack of global coverage of information, we do not account for so-called under-water discards, or net-mortality of fishing gears46. We also do not address mortality caused by ghost-fishing of abandoned or lost fishing gear47. 
 
 For commercially caught jellyfishes (particularly Rhizostomeae, but also other taxa), it has been shown that over 2.5 time more are caught than reported to FAO (mostly as ‘Rhizostoma spp.’)48. This factor is used to estimate missing catches of unidentified jellyfish. However, this additional catch is, pending further study, not allocated to any specific country or FAO area, and is thus counted only in the world’s total catch. 
 
 We exclude from consideration all catches of marine mammals, reptiles, corals, sponges and marine plants (the bulk of the plant material is not primarily used for human consumption, but for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use). In addition, we do not estimate catches made for the aquarium trade, which can be substantial in some areas in terms of number of individuals, but relatively small in overall tonnage, as most aquarium fish are small or juvenile specimens49. 
 
 Most catch reconstructions consist of six steps15: 
 
 (1) Identification, sourcing and comparison of baseline catch times series, that is, (a) FAO reported landings data by FAO statistical areas, taxon and year; and (b) national or regional data series by area, taxon and year. Implicit in this first step is that the spatial entity be identified and named that is to be reported on (for example, EEZ of Germany in the Baltic Sea), something that is not always obvious, and which poses problems to some of our external collaborators, notably those in countries with a claimed EEZ overlapping with that of their neighbour. 
 
 For most countries, the baseline data are the statistics reported by member countries to FAO. We treat all countries recognized in 2010 (or acting like independent countries with regards to fisheries) by the international community as having existed from 1950 to 2010. This is necessary, given our emphasis on ‘places’, that is, on time-series of catches taken from specific ecosystems. This also applies to islands and other territories, many of which were colonies, and which have changed status and borders since 1950. 
 
 For several countries, the baseline data are provided by international bodies. In the case of EU countries, the baseline data originate from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which maintains fisheries statistics by smaller statistical areas, as required given the Common Fisheries Policy of the EU. A similar area is the Antarctic waters and surrounding islands, whose fisheries are managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), where catch data are available by relatively small statistical areas50. 
 
 When FAO data are used, care is taken to maintain their assignment to different FAO statistical areas for each country (Supplementary Fig. 1), as they often distinguish between strongly different ecosystems. For example, the Caribbean Sea versus the coast of the Eastern Central Pacific in the case of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. For each maritime country, the area covered extends from the coastline to the edge of the EEZ, including any major coastal lagoons connected to the sea, and the mouths of rivers, that is, estuaries. However, freshwaters are excluded. 
 
 (2) Identification of sectors (for example, subsistence, recreational), time periods, species, gears and so on, not covered by (1), that is, missing data components. This is conducted via literature searches and consultations with local experts. This step is one where the contribution of local co-authors and experts is crucial. Potentially, all four sectors defined by us can occur in the marine fisheries of a given coastal country, with the distinction between large-scale and small-scale being the most important25. For any entity, we check whether catches originating from the four sectors were included in the reported baseline of catch data, notably by examining their taxonomic composition, and any metadata, which were particularly detailed in the early decades of the FAO ‘Yearbooks’51. 
 
 The absence of a taxon known to be caught in a country or territory from the baseline data (for example, cockles gleaned by women on the shore of an estuary)26 can also be used to identify a fishery that has been overlooked in the official data collection scheme, as can the absence of reef fishes in the coastal data of a Pacific Island state10. To avoid double counting, tuna and other large pelagic fishes, unless known to be caught by a local small-scale fishery (and thus in the past not likely reported to a Regional Fisheries Management Organization or RFMO), are not included in this reconstruction step (see below under ‘High Seas and other catches of large pelagic fishes’). 
 
 Finally, if gears are identified in national data, but a gear known to exist in a given country is not included, then it can be assumed that its catch has been missed, as documented for weirs (hadrah) in the Persian Gulf52. 
 
 (3) Sourcing of alternative information sources on missing sectors identified in (2), via literature searches (peer-reviewed and grey) and consultations with local experts. Information sources include social science studies (anthropology, economics and so on), reports, data sets and expert knowledge. The major initial source of information for catch reconstructions is governments’ websites and publications (specifically their Department of Fisheries or equivalent agency), both online and in hard copies. Contrary to what could be expected, it is often not the agency responsible for fisheries research and initial data collection that supplies the catch statistics to FAO, but other agencies, for example, statistical office or agency. As a result, much of the granularity of the original data (that is, catch by sector, by species or by gear) may be lost even before data are prepared for submission to FAO. Furthermore, the data request form sent by FAO each year to each country does not encourage improvements or changes in taxonomic composition, as the form that requests the most recent year’s data contains the country’s previous years’ data in the same composition as submitted in earlier years. This encourages the pooling of detailed data at the national level into the taxonomic categories inherited through earlier (often decades old) FAO reporting schemes, as was discovered, for example, for Bermuda in the early 2000s (ref. 53). Thus, by getting back to the original data, much of the original granularity can be regained during reconstructions. 
 
 Additional sources of information on national catches are international organizations such as FAO, ICES or SPC (Secretariat of the Pacific Community), or a Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) such as NAFO (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization), or CCAMLR54, or current or past regional fisheries development and/or management projects (many of them launched and supported by FAO), such as the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem project (BOBLME). All these organizations and projects issue reports and publications describing—sometimes in considerable details—the fisheries of their member countries. Another source of information is the academic literature, now widely accessible through Google Scholar. 
 
 A good source of information for the earlier decades (especially the 1950s and 1960s) for countries that were part of former colonial empires (especially British or French) are the colonial archives in London (British Colonial Office) and the ‘Archives Nationales d'Outre-Mer’, in Aix-en-Provence, and the publications of ORSTOM (Office de la recherche scientifique et technique d’outre-mer), for former French colonies. A further source of information and data are non-fisheries sources, including household and/or nutritional surveys, which are occasionally used for estimating unreported subsistence catches. Our global network of local collaborators is also crucial in this respect, as they have access to key data sets, publications and local knowledge not available elsewhere, often in languages other than English. 
 
 Supplementary Figure 2 shows a plot of the publications used for slightly over 110 reconstructions against their date of publication. Although, recent publications predominate, older publications firmly anchor the 1950s catch estimates of many reconstructions. On average, around 35 unique publications were used per reconstruction (not counting online sources and personal communications). 
 
 Potential language bias is taken seriously in the Sea Around Us, to ensure that data are collated in languages other than English. Besides team members who read Chinese, others speak Arabic, Danish, Filipino/Tagalog, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. To deal with other languages, research assistants are hired who speak, for example, Korean or Malay/Indonesian. We also rely on our multilingual network of colleagues and friends throughout the world, for example, for Greek or Thai. While it is true that English has now become the undisputed language of science55, other languages are used by billions of people, and assembling knowledge about the fisheries of the world is not possible without the capacity to explore the literature in languages other than English. 
 
 (4) Development of data ‘anchor points’ in time for each missing data item, and expansion of anchor point data to country-wide catch estimates. ‘Anchor’ points are catch estimates usually pertaining to a single year and sector, and often to an area not exactly matching the limits of the EEZ or IFA in question. Thus, an anchor point pertaining to a fraction of the coastline of a given country may need to be expanded to the country as a whole. For expansion, we use fisher or population density, or relative IFA or shelf area as raising factor, as appropriate given the local condition. In all cases, we consider that case studies underlying or providing the anchor point data may had a case-selection bias (for example, representing an exceptionally good area or community for study, compared with other areas in the same country), and thus use raising factors very conservatively. 
 
 (5) Interpolation for time periods between data anchor points, either linearly or assumption based for commercial fisheries, and generally via per capita (or per fisher) catch rates for non-commercial sectors. Fisheries are often difficult to govern, as they are social activities involving multiple actors. In particular, fishing effort is often difficult to reduce, at least in the short term. Thus, if anchor points are available for years separated by multi-year intervals, it usually will be more reasonable to assume that the underlying fishing activity continues in the intervening years with no data. We tread this ‘continuity’ assumption as a default proposition. Exceptions to such continuity assumptions are major environmental impacts such a hurricanes or tsunamis56, or major socio-political disturbances, such as military conflicts or civil wars57, which we explicitly consider with regards to the use of raising factors and the structure of time series estimates. In such cases, our reconstructions mark the event through a temporary change (for example, decline) in the catch time series, which is documented in the text of each catch reconstruction. At the very least, this provides pointers for future research on the relationship between fishery catches and natural catastrophes or conflicts. We note that the absence of such signals (such as a reduction in catch for a year or two) in the officially reported catch statistics for countries having experienced a major natural or socio-political disturbance can be a sign that their official catch data may not accurately reflect what occurs on the ground. This contributes to the emergence of ‘poor numbers’40. Overall, our reconstructions assume—when no information to the contrary is available—that commercial catches (that is, industrial and artisanal) can be linearly interpolated between anchor points, while non-commercial catches (that is, subsistence and recreational) can generally be interpolated between anchor points using non-linear trends in human population numbers or number of fishers over time (via per capita rates). 
 
 Radical and rapid effort reductions as a result of an intentional policy decision and implementation do not occur widely. One example we are aware of is the trawl ban of 1980 in Western Indonesia58. The ban had little or no impact on official Indonesian fisheries statistics for Western Indonesia, another indication that these statistics may have little to do with the realities on the ground. FAO hints at this being widespread in the Western Central Pacific and the Eastern Indian Ocean (the only FAO areas where reported catches appear to be increasing) when they note that ‘while some countries (i.e., the Russian Federation, India and Malaysia) have reported decreases in some years, marine catches submitted to FAO by Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia and China show continuous growth, i.e., in some cases resulting in an astonishing decadal increase (e.g., Myanmar up 121 percent, and Vietnam up 47 percent)’.42 
 
 (6) Estimation of total catch times series. A reconstruction is completed when the estimated catch time series derived through steps 2–5 are combined and harmonized with the reported catch of step 1. Generally, this results in an increase of the overall catch, but several cases exist where the reconstructed total catch is lower than the reported catch. The best documented case of this is that of mainland China14, whose over-reported catches for local waters in the Northwest Pacific are compensated for by under-reported catches taken by Chinese distant water fleets fishing elsewhere. In the 2000s, Chinese distant water fleets operated in the EEZs of over 90 countries, that is, in most parts of the world’s oceans5. Harmonizing reconstructed catches with the reported baselines goes hand-in-hand with documenting the entire reconstruction procedure. Thus, every reconstruction is documented and published, either in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, or as detailed technical reports in the publicly accessible and indexed Fisheries Centre Research Reports series or the Fisheries Centre Working Paper series, or other regional organization reports (Supplementary Table 5). 
 
 Several reconstructions were conducted in the mid- to late 2000s, when official reported data (that is, FAO statistics or national data) were not available to 2010 (refs 15, 59). All these cases are updated to 2010, in line with each country’s individual reconstruction approach to estimating missing catch data. Thus, all reconstructions are brought to 2010 to ensure identical time coverage (Supplementary Table 5). 
 
 Since these six points were originally proposed, a seventh point has come to the fore that cannot be ignored10: 
 
 (7) Quantifying the uncertainty associated with each reconstruction. In fisheries research, catch data are rarely associated with a measure of uncertainty, at least not in the form resembling confidence intervals. This may reflect the fact that the issue with catch data is not a lack of precision (that is, whether we could expect to produce similar results upon re-estimation), but about accuracy, that is, attempting to eliminate a systematic bias, a type of error which statistical theory does not really address. 
 
 We deal with this issue through a procedure related to ‘pedigrees’60 and the approach used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to quantify the uncertainty in its assessments61. The authors of the reconstructions are asked to attribute a ‘score’ expressing their evaluation of the quality of the time series data to each fisheries sector (industrial, artisanal and so on) for each of the three time periods (1950–1969, 1970–1989 and 1990–2010). These ‘scores’ are (1) ‘very low’, (2) ‘low’, (3) ‘high’ and (4) ‘very high’ (Table 1). There is a deliberate absence of an uninformative ‘medium’ score, to avoid the effective ‘non-choice’ that this option would represent. Each of these scores is assigned a percentage uncertainty range (Table 1). Thereafter, the overall mean weighted percentage uncertainty (over all countries and sectors) was computed (Fig. 1).

 Foreign catches 
 
 We define foreign catches as taken by vessels of a maritime state in the EEZ, or EEZ-equivalent waters of another coastal state. Based on our definition of sectors, all foreign fishing in the waters of another country is deemed to be industrial in nature. As the High Seas legally belong to no one (or to everyone), there can be no ‘foreign’ catches in the High Seas. Prior to UNCLOS, and the declaration of EEZs by maritime countries, foreign catches were illegal only if conducted without explicit permission within the territorial waters of such countries (generally 12 nautical miles). Since the declarations of EEZs by the overwhelming majority of maritime countries, foreign catches are considered illegal if conducted within the EEZ but without access being granted by the coastal state. A distinct exception is the EU, whose waters are managed by a ‘Common Fisheries Policy’, which implies a multilateral ‘access agreement’. 
 
 Access permission can be tacit and based on historic rights (‘observed’ access), or more commonly in the form of explicit access agreements and involving compensatory payment for the coastal state. The Sea Around Us, building on previous work by FAO62, has created a database of such access and agreements, which is used to allocate the catches of distant-water fleets to the waters where they were taken. 
 
 This information is then harmonized with the catches reported by FAO for countries fishing outside their country’s ‘home’ FAO areas, which always identifies this catch as distant-water industrial catch (see below for tuna catches reported to RFMOs). 
 
 In line with INTERPOL and others63, we define illegal fishing as foreign fishing within the EEZ waters of another country without a permission to access these resources. We do not treat domestic fisheries’ violations of ‘fishing regulations’ as ‘illegal’. In general, our reconstruction method cannot readily distinguish between legal and illegal foreign fishing, as we do not necessarily know about all access agreements5, 6. Thus, our data only pertain to ‘reported’ versus ‘unreported’ status, irrespective of legality of foreign fleets in a host country5. However, for around two dozen countries (mainly in West Africa) where the number of illegally operating vessels could be inferred, the fleet size can be multiplied by appropriate catch per unit of effort rates, leading to an estimate of illegal catch in these EEZs. 
 
 Industrial catches of large pelagic fishes 
 
 Nominal landings data. To date, there is no single, publicly available data set presenting industrial landings of tuna and large pelagic fishes for the entire world that is separate from the amalgamated FAO statistics, despite these fisheries being among the most valuable in the world64. Here, we first compile nominal industrial landings of tuna and other large pelagic fish caught either in the High Seas or within EEZs by fishing gear, taxon, countries and statistical reporting areas from data published by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. Second, we use partially spatialized landings data provided by staff of the French ‘Institut de recherche pour le développement’ to spatially pre-assign the nominal landings data derived from RFMOs (Supplementary Table 6). 
 
 For each ocean, the nominal landings data are spatialized according to reported proportions in the previously spatialized data (Supplementary Table 6). For example, if the nominal data reports France catching 100 tonnes of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in 1983 using longlines, but the spatial data only present 85 tonnes of yellowfin tuna reported in 1983 by France using longlines in four separate statistical cells, the nominal 100 tonnes for France are split into these four spatial cells according to their reported proportion of catch in the spatial dataset. This matching of the nominal and spatial records is done over a series of successive refinements, with the first being the best-case scenario, in which there are matching records for year, country, gear and taxon. The last refinement is the worst-case scenario, in which there are no matching records except for the year of catch. For example, if Sri Lanka reports 100 tonnes of yellowfin tuna caught in 1983 using longlines, but there are no spatial records for any country catching yellowfin tuna in 1983, the nominal 100 tonnes for Sri Lanka are split into spatial cells according to their reported proportions of total catch of any species and gear in 1983. The end result is a baseline landings database containing all matched and spatialized catch records, which sum to the original nominal catch tonnages. 
 
 Discards. A review of the literature for each ocean provided limited country- and fleet-specific discard data. Therefore, we average the discard rates across the entire time period and apply these to the region of origin of the fleet (for example, East Asia or Western Europe), rather than the actual country of origin of the fleet. Discards were spatialized in conjunction with nominal landings data. 
 
 Assembly of total catches 
 
 Ultimately, the total catch extracted from a given area, such as a given EEZ or EEZ-equivalent waters, or high seas waters within a given FAO area is computed as the sum of three data layers: (1) the reconstructed domestic catches within home EEZs (‘Layer 1’ data); (2) the derived catch by foreign fleets (‘Layer 2’ data); and (3) the tuna and other large pelagic fishes caught in the High Seas and in EEZs (‘Layer 3’ data). 
 
 Documentation of the catch reconstructions 
 
 The references and web-links of the contributions documenting the catch reconstructions that went into the re-estimation of the global catch of marine fisheries are documented in Supplementary Table 5. Altogether, 273 EEZs (or EEZ ‘components’) were covered in 247 catch reconstructions, which had 103 unique first authors and 279 unique co-authors in over 50 countries. 
 
 All data presented here are also deposited in the Dryad Digital Depository (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.4s4t1). 
 
 Analyses 
 
 To examine if significant breakpoints exist in the catch data time series of both reconstructed total catches and reported catches that may illustrate a change in trends of catches over time (that is, a change in the slope), we analyse the time series trajectories using segmented regression21. For both the reconstructed as well as reported time series, we identify two breakpoints, being 1967 and 1996, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). These breakpoints suggest a change in regression slope, with the second breakpoint suggesting a trend reversal. This was validated by testing for a significant difference-in-slope parameter using the Davies test65, which tests for a non-zero difference-in-slope of a segmented regression relationship. ||||| Commonly cited statistics have understated the size of the global seafood catch by about 30%, a new tally finds. The estimate, drawn in part from a painstaking effort to gather statistics on poorly documented subsistence, recreational, and illegal fisheries, suggests that the world catch has also declined more steeply since the 1990s than official figures indicate. 
 
 Overall, fishers caught an estimated 109 million metric tons (mt) of fish in 2010, researchers report today in Nature Communications. That’s well above the 77 million mt that nations reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, which keeps global catch statistics. 
 
 The reconstructed 2010 catch was 15% below peak landings of 130 million mt in 1996, estimate the researchers, who are based at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver in Canada. In contrast, FAO figures for the same 14-year period showed an 11% decline, from 86 million mt to 77 million mt. 
 
 The researchers also suggest that incomplete statistics have led FAO to make questionable pronouncements: Not long ago, they note, one of the agency’s reports described global catch levels as “practically stable.” The new figures challenge that idea, the researchers say. 
 
 FAO officials, however, are pushing back against the validity of the new numbers. “Comparing reconstructed catches with FAO statistics would be like comparing apples and oranges,” wrote Marc Taconet, chief of FAO’s Fishery Statistics and Information Branch in Rome, in an email. He added that based on “several sources of biases in the [study’s] method and the wide uncertainty ranges, we express reservations that the paper’s conclusions of declining catch trends can be strongly opposed to FAO’s reports of stable capture production trends in recent years.” 
 
 Many fisheries scientists have long been skeptical of the completeness of FAO’s statistics. The agency relies on national governments to estimate all of their catch except discards, and many nations don’t have the interest or capacity to tally landings from artisanal, subsistence, and recreational fisheries. And some nations have over- or underreported catches for political reasons, or ignored illegal landings, further complicating efforts to understand how fish stocks—a key source of protein—are faring. 
 
 To try to fill those gaps, researchers with the Sea Around Us project at UBC tapped into a worldwide network of colleagues. Over more than a decade, they attempted to reconstruct historic catches by scouring a range of sources, including academic papers, government websites, and reports gathering dust in local libraries and government archives. 
 
 The biggest surprise, says lead author Daniel Pauly of UBC, was the size of the artisanal and subsistence catches, primarily in the developing world: They amounted to 25% of the total. Overall, these catches slightly increased during the study period as more people participated, the researchers found. 
 
 These fisheries are also putting worrying pressure on many fish stocks, the study concluded. In small island countries sprinkled across the Pacific and the Caribbean, for instance, Pauly says, “the situation is much worse than anyone knew: the catches of local reef fish were crashing all over the place and the government officials didn’t know or care.” Pauly hopes the study “will get governments to focus more on their local fisheries.” 
 
 Shrinking industrial landings, however, were responsible for most of the recent global catch decline, the researchers concluded. Industrial landings, which make up about 75% of the global total, dropped by about 2% a year between the 1990s and 2010, they estimate. 
 
 Some eye-popping findings emerged from the examination of the industrial catch, the researchers say. West African nations, for instance, historically appear to have reported to FAO just 40% of the catches made by local vessels in near-shore waters, found UBC’s Dyhia Belhabib. And foreign vessels that lacked licenses to fish in those waters accounted for just over one-half of the offshore catch, she found. 
 
 Such findings highlight the need for nations, and FAO, to improve record keeping, the authors say. Better numbers, they add, will be essential to developing policies to protect a key food source. “Fish stocks are like bank accounts,” says co-author Dirk Zeller, senior scientist and executive director of Sea Around Us. “You need to know how much there is, and at what interest rate your money’s growing, so you can decide how much you want to take out.” 
 
 One step FAO could take, the authors say, is asking nations to report both documented and estimated catches. “Most countries use extensive estimation, approximation and raising procedures, especially in developing countries,” Zeller says. “Hence essentially all countries could estimate uncertainties around their reported data if they chose.” 
 
 “We concur with the paper’s call upon countries’ responsibilities for improving reporting and for mobilizing funding resources,” FAO’s Taconet said, adding that the agency “always welcomes research efforts. … This type of research is crucial for stimulating international discussion on unreported catches.” 
 
 What the reconstruction team has done “is monumental!” wrote Trevor Branch, a fisheries scientist at the University of Washington, Seattle, in an email. Although he doubts all of the numbers are accurate, he expects the data will improve over time as more specialists contribute to the database.","– Global overfishing might be much worse than previously thought, Discovery reports. A new study finds that UN figures have vastly understated the problem and that yearly fish hauls are declining three times faster than realized. According to the study, the UN—using numbers from the Food and Agriculture Organization—stated that global fishing peaked in 1996 at 86 million metric tons, but the researchers say it was actually closer to 130 million metric tons. Since then, the study claims the total amount of fish caught has declined by 1.2 million metric tons per year—not 0.4 million metric tons as the UN had said, the Guardian reports. “Our results indicate that the decline is very strong and is not due to countries fishing less,"" study author Daniel Pauly says. ""It is due to countries having fished too much and having exhausted one fishery after another.” The study, which was published Tuesday in Nature Communications, is based on a decade of work by 400 researchers around the world. The numbers used by the UN come from the self-reporting of more than 200 countries and territories, and governments might not always be inclined to give accurate fishing counts, notes the Guardian. Researchers undertook a ""Herculean task"" to get more accurate counts for the years from 1950 to 2010, says one professor not involved with the study. “The world is withdrawing from a joint bank account of fish without knowing what has been withdrawn or the remaining balance,” Pauly tells Discovery. And while the Food and Agriculture Organization disputes the study's new numbers, it does agree with its conclusion that countries need to improve their reporting, according to Science.

286,"The Rules Buy Time for Rubio 
 
 The Republican delegate rules, relative to those for the Democrats, are biased toward candidates who win. That makes it very easy to imagine how Mr. Trump could sweep to the nomination over a divided field. 
 
 But that’s not so true before March 15, when party rules prevent states from apportioning their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. Most states wound up splitting their delegates, awarding a pool of at-large delegates proportionally by the percentage of the vote and awarding other delegates to the candidates who lead in each congressional district. 
 
 As a result, it will be difficult on Super Tuesday for Mr. Trump to amass a significant majority of delegates if the other two major candidates — Mr. Rubio and Ted Cruz — clear the thresholds (at highest 20 percent) for earning proportional delegates. It seemed quite possible a few weeks ago that Mr. Trump could build a big lead on Super Tuesday, but Jeb Bush’s exit from the race and the big bump in Mr. Rubio’s poll numbers make it far less likely that Mr. Trump can pull that off. 
 
 Imagine, for a moment, that the candidates fare about as well on Super Tuesday as they have through the first four contests. Given the types of states in play on Super Tuesday, perhaps that yields something like a 34-25-25 percent split between Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz.

 In this scenario, Mr. Trump claims a clear edge in delegate accumulation but not a majority. He gets 279 delegates, or just 44 percent of the delegates at stake, while Mr. Rubio receives 164 delegates. 
 
 It’s a respectable tally for Mr. Rubio, even though he loses every state. That’s because he clears 20 percent in every state. That scenario includes Texas, where the most delegates are at stake on Super Tuesday and where Mr. Rubio is in the most danger of missing the delegate threshold because of Mr. Cruz’s home-state popularity. For anyone counting delegates, whether Mr. Rubio reaches 20 percent in Texas is a lot more important than anything else. 
 
 Supposing that Mr. Rubio clears all of these thresholds, he has two big objectives: beating Mr. Cruz in the South, in hopes of driving him from the race, and winning a state or two. His schedule reflects this strategy. He’s visiting a host of Southern states where Mr. Cruz is hoping to do well, and where delegate thresholds still pose some risk to his ability to deny Mr. Trump a majority of delegates. He’s spending all of Sunday in Virginia, which should be one of his best states because of its mix of religious and well-educated voters. Virginia is a clear momentum play (the lift that could come from finally winning); the state uses a purely proportional delegate system, so there are fewer delegates to be gained there than by winning just about anywhere else. Minnesota would seem to be another good option for Mr. Rubio.

 The deficit for Mr. Rubio after Super Tuesday in this scenario — 181 over all and 115 from Super Tuesday — would not be especially big. If Mr. Rubio won Florida — a winner-take-all state worth 99 delegates — it could balance out nearly all losses from Super Tuesday. 
 
 Then All Eyes Are on March 15 
 
 But for the same reason Mr. Rubio can erase so much damage by winning in Florida on March 15, he can’t afford to lose on March 15 either. 
 
 Ohio and Florida will award their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. Missouri will award its delegates on a winner-take-all basis by congressional district, and Illinois isn’t much different. North Carolina, on the other hand, awards its delegates proportionally. It figures less prominently in the delegate math and as a result the candidates are unlikely to spend money there on television advertisements or campaign stops.

 If Mr. Trump swept the day in the same way he is expected to sweep Super Tuesday, he would net nearly three times as many delegates as he would on Super Tuesday, defeating Mr. Rubio, 282 delegates to 40. For Mr. Rubio, winning Florida would make Mr. Trump’s advantage a more manageable 183 to 139, but his hole would start looking pretty deep. 
 
 With that sort of a deficit, Mr. Rubio’s chances of winning a majority of delegates would all but evaporate. 
 
 Even if Mr. Rubio swept on March 15 and started doing as well as Mitt Romney did at that stage in 2012, he would barely edge ahead of Mr. Trump in the pledged delegate count. And of course, there would be plenty of reason to question whether Mr. Rubio could really do so well after losing so many states to that point. 
 
 Delegate Math Isn’t The Problem 
 
 Winning by March 15 is what matters for Mr. Rubio, not the math. 
 
 It’s not going to be easy. The Republican establishment is flocking to him, but the escalating pace of the primary season makes it harder for him to take advantage of growing support from the party. There’s not much time for him to raise money, and whatever he does raise will be spread fairly thin. 
 
 The party isn’t fully unified either, with Mr. Cruz and particularly John Kasich remaining in the race. Mr. Trump holds between 30 and 40 percent of the vote, most national surveys say, so it is very difficult for Mr. Rubio to overtake him when votes are siphoned off by another candidate. If Mr. Kasich remains in the race, his home state of Ohio will be very difficult for Mr. Rubio to win. 
 
 There’s a final issue: Some big winner-take-all and winner-take-most states aren’t necessarily favorable ground for him. 
 
 The Winner-Take-All States Seem Promising for Trump If the rest of the country votes the way the first four states did, Donald Trump will have an edge in the big winner-take-all contests. New Jersey Delaware Florida Ohio United States Arizona Montana South Dakota Nebraska 43.6 40.2 39.4 37.0 35.3 33.9 31.5 30.5 27.8 
 
 Mr. Trump has tended to fare best with less educated and less religious voters. There’s also evidence he does better in places with a larger nonwhite population. Florida and Ohio fit the bill. And separately New Jersey also shapes up well for him later in the calendar. They’re all projected to be above-average states for Mr. Trump based on the results so far (though obviously this can change, and it doesn’t account for a potential home-state edge for Mr. Rubio in Florida and Mr. Kasich in Ohio).

 New Quinnipiac surveys show Mr. Trump ahead in Ohio and Florida. 
 
 Rubio Needs Others To Quit 
 
 But there is one important bit of good news for Mr. Rubio: the struggles of Ted Cruz. He has finished third in two consecutive contests where he had hoped to perform well. He is in danger of being shut out on Super Tuesday; he could even lose his home state, Texas. Polls show him falling behind Mr. Rubio in other Southern states like Georgia and Oklahoma. 
 
 The Cruz campaign has always been clear that it is counting on a strong showing on Super Tuesday, and Mr. Cruz’s path to the nomination would look exceptionally bleak if he fared as poorly on March 1 as he did in South Carolina and Nevada. It could be enough to force him from the race. Mr. Kasich’s play is less clear, but he could quit if he finishes poorly in Michigan on March 8. 
 
 If Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich exited, it would give Mr. Rubio the chance to build a coalition of ideologically consistent conservative voters and more mainstream, well-educated conservatives. The onset of a real one-on-one race would pose a challenge to Mr. Trump, who would finally be forced to build a majority coalition. 
 
 So far, more G.O.P. voters tell pollsters they would definitely oppose Mr. Trump than currently support him, which at least raises the possibility that Mr. Rubio could prevail in a one-on-one fight. Polls pitting the two against each other have shown a tight race or even a lead for Mr. Rubio. 
 
 Mr. Trump would also have to overcome a barrage of negative television advertisements — something he hasn’t had to face very much of so far. 
 
 Whether Mr. Rubio could in fact consolidate the preponderance of Mr. Kasich or Mr. Cruz’s supporters is hard to say. 
 
 But whether it happens before March 15 could easily decide the outcome of the Republican race. ||||| With just five days until Super Tuesday, time is growing perilously short for the Republican “establishment” — whatever that means these days — to stop the Donald Trump train from picking up even more speed. Five days is two fewer than God had to make the world and all its creatures, and if you have looked at Trump’s poll numbers lately, the establishment’s task might seem equally gargantuan. 
 
 But there are a couple of places where Trump looks vulnerable. Where? We don’t have polling for every Super Tuesday state, and certainly not enough to drill down beneath state-level data. But here’s one clue: Where is Team Rubio buying TV time? The answer: Virginia, Georgia and Texas. His PAC has splashed out over $1.5 million in these key Super Tuesday states and appears focused on the establishment’s backyard as well — Virginia’s Washington, D.C. suburbs. 
 
 According to our most recent polls-plus forecast, Rubio, recently crowned prince of the GOP donor class, has a 43 percent chance of winning Virginia on Tuesday, a slight advantage over Trump. The D.C. suburbs in northern Virginia are home to many who make their living working, directly or indirectly, for the government. Like most large metropolitan areas, the District of Columbia and its suburbs tend to break for Democrats in general elections, but the area has sizable pockets of Republican voters. In 2012, 40 percent of Fairfax County and 30 percent of Arlington County voted for Mitt Romney. 
 
 Since Tuesday, a Rubio PAC, Conservative Solutions, has spent $245,430 in the D.C. media market for ads set to air through Tuesday’s primaries. And the PAC has spent over $144,000 in the rest of the state, focusing its buys in the Virginia Beach/Norfolk area, along with Richmond. (The Rubio campaign itself has made modest buys in Virginia Beach/Norfolk, though not in the D.C. metro area.) 
 
 And in Georgia, where we give Rubio a 29 percent chance of winning (compared with 64 percent for Trump), the Rubio PAC just dropped $455,258 in the Atlanta media market. Hotlanta indeed. 
 
 Where else is the money going? Texas — including Houston, Ted Cruz’s fortress of Constitutionalism and cowboy boots. Conservative Solutions spent a whopping $689,302 on ads to air over the next few days in Dallas, Austin, Houston, and San Antonio. 
 
 And what about Trump? Not a major ad buy in sight. 
 
 UPDATE (Feb. 25, 3:19 p.m.): Rubio’s chances of winning in Virginia and Georgia have been updated to reflect new polls in those states.","– Whether Marco Rubio's aggressive performance in Thursday's debate translates into success on Super Tuesday remains an open question, but the Upshot blog has some hopeful news for his campaign: Even if Donald Trump sweeps all the states in play—and polls suggest he has a decent chance of doing that—Rubio remains very much alive. The main reason is that Republicans forbid winner-take-all contests prior to March 15, meaning Rubio (and Ted Cruz) can still pile up delegates for second and third place. The blog floats the possibility of Trump winning the day with a 34-25-25 percent split over the other two, in line with his previous victories. That would give him 279 delegates and Rubio 164. ""It’s a respectable tally for Mr. Rubio, even though he loses every state,"" writes Nate Cohn. Ideal? No, but it keeps him afloat until March 15, when big winner-take-all states such as Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, North Carolina, and Rubio's home state of Florida come into play. At this point, Rubio would have to win some of those to have any hope of beating Trump. If not, his ""chances of winning a majority of delegates would all but evaporate."" Of course, Rubio hopes to pull off some victories on Tuesday, and FiveThirtyEight notes that his campaign is spending heavily in Virginia and Georgia to make that happen. He's also spending big in Texas, which has the most delegates at stake, for a different reason. Because it's Cruz's home turf, Texas is where Rubio is most vulnerable to failing to receive 20% of the vote, the threshold for receiving any delegates at all.","<pad> The GOP delegate rules are biased toward candidates who win. That makes it very easy to imagine how Mr. Trump could sweep to the nomination over a divided field. But that’s not so true before March 15, when party rules prevent states from apportioning their delegates on a winner-take-all basis.

 The One-­Stop Shop for Ultimate Driving Experiences in Las Vegas ||||| There will be a brand-new thrill ride at Walt Disney World beginning in mid-January, but it won't be what you'd expect. 
 
 The Richard Petty Driving Experience, which already offers stock car drives at the Disney World Speedway, will begin offering rides in exotic cars such as Ferraris and Lamborghinis. 
 
 The new option is coming, in part, because the stock car business, including NASCAR, has contracted in the tough economy, said Mike Bartelli, chief marketing officer of the Richard Petty Driving Experience. 
 
 ""So we looked at extensions of what we do in the stock car arena to help build our business, and what we're good at is putting people in cars, safely,'' Bartelli said. ""We've got the track, we're here year-round, and we know there are people who would love to drive these cars on a race track, given the opportunity."" 
 
 The Exotic Driving Experience is expecting to start out with two Ferraris, two Lamborghinis, a Porsche 911 and an Audi R8. Other brands and models could be added in the future. 
 
 Prices will start with ""Thrill Rides,"" with a Petty instructor driving, for $99. The actual driving experience will start at $199 for six laps, with an instructor in the passenger seat. 
 
 Prices will vary depending on the car, and the ride will be preceded by classroom instruction. All the cars will have automatic transmissions. For information, visit http://www.exoticdriving.com 
 
 The Experience expects to acquire the cars from Orlando-area dealers. Petty would like to offer the Exotic Driving Experience at Daytona International Speedway soon and likely Homestead-Miami Speedway. 
 
 The Petty Experience at Disney World has given stock car rides and drives to more than 250,000 customers, Bartelli said. 
 
 ""And we think the Exotic Driving Experience has the potential to be every bit as successful as the stock cars,"" he said. 
 
 SCSmith3@Tribune.com","– From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the Ferraris of Florida—one ride at Disney World will get a lot more horsepower in January. The park plans to add ""exotic driving"" to its repertoire, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Along with two Ferraris (which go from zero to 60 in 3.4 seconds), there will be two Lamborghinis (each worth a not-too-shabby $260,000), a Porsche 911, and an Audi R8 that tourists looking for a spin a little edgier than Mr. Toad's Wild Ride can take out on the Disney World Speedway, with six laps costing from $199 to $389, depending on the car.

Gary Johnson brought down the house at Thursday night's Fox News/ Google debate when he joked about how his ""next-door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than this current administration."" 
 
 The joke killed among the GOP faithful. But was Johnson the first to use it? 
 
 Just today, talk radio host Rush Limbaugh delivered a similar joke on air. 
 
 ""My dogs have created more shovel-ready work than Obama has just this week alone,"" Limbaugh said. ""The new puppy. Honest to God. More shovel-ready work for me this week than Obama has created all two and a half years."" 
 
 So what does Limbaugh think of the similarity? 
 
 ""I guess I've become show prep for the GOP debates now, too,"" Limbaugh told The Huffington Post in an email. Limbaugh said he thought he used the line yesterday, ""but the days run together, so I'm not really sure."" 
 
 Limbaugh didn't hear the joke live because he was traveling, but said he's received many emails about it. 
 
 UPDATE: HuffPost’s Sara Kenigsberg spoke to Johnson about the joke shortly after the GOP debate ended. Johnson told her that Jim Villanucci, a former ""Tonight Show"" writer and current radio host on Albuquerque’s KKOB station, sent him several jokes late Thursday afternoon. ""He texted me about eight one-liners that maybe I could use so it was one of those things that, 'wow, that was really funny,"" Johnson said. He didn't know about Limbaugh telling the joke earlier today. 
 
 WATCH ||||| ORLANDO, Fla. -- Last night, Gary Johnson won some actual, desparately needed buzz for this joke: 
 
 My neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than this president. 
 
 Less than 20 minutes later, some gossip circulated: Johnson's joke was a whole lot like one Rush Limbaugh told earlier that day. 
 
 My dogs have created more shovel-ready work than Obama has. In this week alone. 
 
 I asked Johnson about this after the debate. ""I didn't listen to the show today,"" he said. ""Someone else encouraged me to tell that joke."" Later, he told the Huffington Post exactly which friend sent him the zinger. 
 
 
 
 It's a credible story, because some version of the joke has appeared on bumper stickers since the Tea Party boom of 2009. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Subliminally, I wonder if this was one of the reasons the joke hit so well. There was familiarity, whether conservatives realized it or not. It may have been a year since they last attended large Tea Parties where stuff like this was on sale. Is this bad for Johnson? Hell, when's the last time he had a one-day story, much less a two-day story? 
 
","– He still gets points for delivery, but Gary Johnson's well-received joke at last night's debate—""My neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than this president""—goes back even further than thought, notes Daily Intel. For starters, Rush Limbaugh used it before the debate on his show. ""I guess I've become show prep for the GOP debates now, too,"" he told the Huffington Post when asked about it. But Dave Weigel at Slate points out that the line has been around on Tea Party bumper stickers and signs since 2009. ""Subliminally, I wonder if this was one of the reasons the joke hit so well,"" writes Weigel. ""There was familiarity, whether conservatives realized it or not.""

 CNN ""State of the Union"" host Candy Crowley asked Santorum if he could see himself serving in a Romney administration — and Santorum said no. 
 
 “It’s pretty much a flat 'no,'” he said. “And it’s not because I don’t want to help Gov. Romney and I don’t want to be part of him having a successful presidency, it’s just for me it’s a matter of my priorities and my time of being a husband and a father. I have to take care of them.”

 Romney has to take into account ""very important states"" with his own immigration policies, Santorum said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" 
 
 But Santorum said the presumptive Republican presidential nominee needs to take this chance to “hammer on the president on this now habitual abuse of power,” pointing to President Barack Obama’s decision not to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act. 
 
 Santorum told host Candy Crowley that Obama, with his immigration directive, “has not faithfully executed” the law. 
 
 ""There's a difference between saying, 'I don't like the law. I wish, you know, I wish the law were different. But I'm the president. My job is to faithfully execute.' And he has not faithfully executed,"" Santorum said. 
 
 ""To me, the most outrageous thing was the process in which he did it,"" he added.

 “This is obviously a way to divert attention from very bad news the president has had for three or four weeks,” McCain said. “That’s very clear.” 
 
 There is one “thing that may disturb people after the initial euphoria is over"" — that the president can dictate certain laws will not be enforced, the senator said. 
 
 “I don’t recall a time when any president has basically said, ‘we’re not going to enforce a law that’s on the books,’” McCain said of the administration's decision not to seek the deportation of young illegal immigrants. 
 
 “I don’t think a Mitt Romney as president of the United States would say, 'we’re not going to enforce existing laws,'” he added. “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard of a president doing that. It may have happened, but certainly not in this fashion.”

 “We’re not going to bail out the European banks,” the presumptive Republican presidential nominee told Bob Schieffer in an interview aired Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We’re going to be poised here to support our economy, but I’m very much in favor of the fundamental things one does to strengthen the economic footings of a nation and as to what’s going to happen in Europe and what kind of impact that will have here, time will tell. But our banks are on a much stronger basis than they were at the time of the last economic crisis and they have built their capital base and their equity base and worked through a lot of their toxic assets, their toxic loans. And hope that regardless of what happens in Europe, that our banking sector is able to weather the storm.” 
 
 Romney said Europe can handle its own economic problems. 
 
 “Europe is capable of dealing with their banking crisis if they choose to do so,” he said. “Obviously, this is going to depend enormously on Germany. But they and others will have to make that decision but we don’t want to go in and start providing funding to European banks.”

 “She’s quite thrilled, and I’m sure she’ll be watching,” Romney said. “I have a campaign to attend to so I wont be able to see it perform.” 
 
 Romney then made an awkward joke about his wife being addicted to horses. 
 
 “It’s the sport of dressage,” he said. “Not many people are familiar with it, but its something for which she has a passion and, frankly, her getting back on a horse after she was diagnosed with M.S., was able she’s convinced to regenerate her strength and renew that vigor, so she cares very deeply about this sport and about horses. She’s a real, I joke that I’m going to have to send her to Betty Ford for an addition to horses.”

 In an interview with Bob Schieffer aired Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” the presumptive Republican presidential nominee five different times declined to answer whether he would conduct the same policy President Barack Obama on Friday announced his Department of Homeland Security will now pursue. 
 
 Instead of answering the question posed, Romney called for a permanent solution. 
 
 “With regards to these kids who were brought in by their parents through no fault of their own, there needs to be a long-term solution so they know what their status is,” Romney said. “This is something Congress has been working on, and I thought we were about to see some proposals brought forward by Sen. Marco Rubio and by Democrat senators, but the president jumped in and said I'm going to take this action, he called it a stop-gap measure. I don't know why he feels stop-gap measures are the right way to go.” 
 
 After Schieffer asked, directly, four additional times if Romney would repeal the policy without receiving an answer, Romney called the move political. 
 
 “I think the timing is pretty clear, if he really wanted to make a solution that dealt with these kids or with illegal immigration in America, than this is something he would have taken up in his first three and a half years, not in his last few months,” he said. 
 
 Romney has yet to offer an opinion on the merits of Obama’s immigration policy change. On Friday, he told reporters in New Hampshire that he supports Rubio’s proposal, which has yet to be introduced in the Senate. 
 
 On “Fox News Sunday,” Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol said Obama’s moved successfully undercut both Rubio and Romney. 
 
 “This was the anti-Marco Rubio initiative by the administration,” Kristol said. “They were scared. Sen. Rubio was about to introduce his version of the Dream Act, which would have been closer to what President Obama announced than the actual Democratic Dream Act. I wish Rubio had introduced it over the last month or two. He got stalled, not every Republican was on board, the Romney campaign’s been cautious about it.” 
 
 And Kristol said Romney, who during the GOP primary staked out a more conservative position on immigration than his opponents, in particular Texas Gov. Rick Perry, is now in a tight spot. 
 
 “This is a big problem for Romney,” Kristol said. “He needs to take the lead on this, and in my view embrace Marco Rubio’s Dream Act if that’s what he wants and say, ‘Let’s pass this in Congress over the next few months, this is what I’m for.”

290,"This photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA shows Syrian rescue teams investigating the scene after an explosion in Aleppo, Syria, Sunday, March 18, 2012. An explosion ripped through a... (Associated Press) 
 
 Syrian security forces clashed Monday with gunmen in an upscale neighborhood of the capital Damascus that is home to embassies and senior officials in one of the worst confrontations in the tightly-controlled city center in the country's yearlong uprising. At least three people were killed. 
 
 The clash deep in Mazzeh district in west Damascus shows the shifting nature of the conflict in Syria, and suggests that rebels might be trying to offset government morale gains from recent successful offensives against opposition strongholds areas in the north and center of Syria by striking close to where senior regime members live. 
 
 Damascus has been largely free of the daily shootings and deaths reported across the country since the uprising against Assad began in March last year. But in addition to gunbattles in Mazzeh and in the suburbs, the capital has witnessed several major bomb attacks targeting security facilities, most recently on Saturday. The government blames ""terrorists"" for the bombings but the opposition says that the regime itself may be carrying them out to discredit the uprising. 
 
 Monday's fighting broke out when security forces stormed an apartment used as a hideout by an ""armed terrorist"" group in Mazzeh after evacuating the building of all inhabitants, the state-run news agency SANA said. 
 
 It added that the forces killed two of the gunmen and arrested the third while a member of the security forces also lost his life. SANA gave no further details. 
 
 A resident of the western Mazzeh district said automatic rifles and machineguns were used in the two-hour clash that ended at about 4 a.m. local time. ""We also heard three strong explosions,"" said the man who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal. 
 
 He added that the clash was close to the Swiss embassy and the home of Maj. Gen. Assef Shawkat, the deputy chief of staff for security affairs who is married to President Bashar Assad's sister, Bushra. 
 
 Armed rebels are active in Damascus' suburbs and satellite towns but rarely venture into the heart of the capital where Assad's troops are deployed in force. 
 
 The new fighting shows that rebels can still strike in the heart of the capital despite successful government offensive in the past weeks in the suburbs of Damascus, in the central city of Homs and the northern region of Idlib. 
 
 The U.N. says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the year-long uprising. 
 
 Syrian authorities claim the opposition is made up of ""terrorist"" groups carrying out a foreign conspiracy. 
 
 An activist in the capital said the Monday morning clashes occurred near the Political Security Directorate building. He said the clashes were followed with raids by security forces who were searching for the attackers. 
 
 The Local Coordination Committees activist group reported a heavy presence of security troops as well as pro-government gunmen known as shabiha in Mazzeh. It added that many police vehicles were patrolling the area. 
 
 The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists throughout Syria, said 18 of Assad's troops were wounded in the clashes. It described the clashes ""as the most violent of its kind and closest to security centers in Damascus since the revolution began."" 
 
 The rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes thousands of army defectors, have claimed responsibility in the past for attacks against regime forces. 
 
 The group's leader, Col. Riad al-Asaad, refused to comment on the fighting in Damascus when contacted by The Associated Press by telephone. ""This is a sensitive military matter that we cannot comment about,"" he said from Turkey. 
 
 On Saturday, three suicide bombings in Damascus killed 27 people. Two of them also targeted government security buildings. 
 
 On Sunday, an explosion killed two and wounded 30 in the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest. 
 
 The Observatory said troops shelled the central village of Qalaat al-Madiq in central Hama province heavily damaging two homes. It added that troops stormed the northern village of Ebdita and set about 60 homes on fire. 
 
 The group said gunmen opened fire at a car in the northern province of Idlib killing an army lieutenant colonel and wounding two other members of the military.

 DAMASCUS — Syria's ally Russia added its voice Monday to rising calls for a truce so aid can be sent to violence-hit cities after deadly clashes rocked a district of the capital near the heart of the embattled regime. 
 
 France, meanwhile, pressed the UN Security Council to adopt a statement backing international envoy Kofi Annan's mission to end bloodshed that has cost an estimated more than 9,100 lives in the past year. 
 
 President Bashar al-Assad's security forces launched attacks in several regions, opposition activists said. 
 
 Pre-dawn fighting in a heavily guarded area of Damascus, the capital's fiercest since the revolt against Assad's regime erupted, came as residents still reeled from deadly weekend bombings. 
 
 At least three rebels and a member of the security forces were killed in the upscale western neighbourhood of Mazzeh, state television and monitors said. 
 
 ""Three terrorists were killed and a fourth was arrested in the fighting between security forces and an armed terrorist gang sheltered in a house of a residential district,"" the TV reported. 
 
 Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said four rebels were killed. 
 
 Mourtada Rasheed, an activist in Damascus, said blasts and heavy shooting could be heard in Mazzeh and two other districts -- Qaboon and Arbeen. 
 
 In Russia, International Committee of the Red Cross chief Jakob Kellenberger met Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose country is an ally of Damascus and has some influence on the regime. 
 
 ""The two parties call for the Syrian government and armed groups to immediately agree to a daily humanitarian truce to allow the ICRC access to the wounded and to civilians who need to be evacuated,"" the foreign ministry said. 
 
 Moscow ""underscored the need to allow the ICRC access to all detained persons in Syria following the protests"" against Assad's regime. 
 
 An ICRC spokeswoman said the Moscow meeting was part of Kellenberger's broader efforts to prompt world powers to secure commitments from the regime and rebels to lay down their arms for a few hours each day. 
 
 ""The ICRC hopes to see concrete results of such meetings on the ground in the coming days and weeks,"" Victoria Zotikova told AFP. 
 
 Kellenberger expressed fears that much of Syria could soon be engulfed in the type of brutal violence recently seen in the flashpoint city of Homs, where hundreds died in more than a month of shelling and a subsequent army assault. 
 
 ""This is absolutely unacceptable to us,"" he told ITAR-TASS. 
 
 Meanwhile, a mission sent by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan arrived in Damascus for talks on a monitoring operation to end the conflict. 
 
 ""There are five people with expertise in political, peacekeeping and mediation,"" Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told AFP. 
 
 ""They will be staying for as long as they are making progress on reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Mr Annan's proposals,"" he added. 
 
 On Monday, France proposed a UN Security Council statement giving strong backing to Annan's efforts. 
 
 ""The aim now is to find common ground and send a strong message to the Damascus regime,"" a diplomat in New York said, with French Ambassador Gerard Araud saying Paris hopes for a vote on Tuesday. 
 
 The Annan proposal includes a halt to the violence, humanitarian access, the release of detainees held over the past year and withdrawal of security forces from protest cities. 
 
 As a condition for ceasefire talks, the Damascus government insisted that the opposition had to lay down its arms, diplomats at the United Nations said. 
 
 At the same time, neighbouring countries had to guarantee they would not send weapons to Syrian groups or give political or financial support to the opposition, they told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
 
 Separately, technical experts from the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are taking part in a Syrian government-led mission to assess the impact of the deadly crackdown. 
 
 The mission to 15 cities, on the first such assignment in Syria since the violence started, was launched in Homs on Sunday. 
 
 Monday's clashes in the capital came after twin car bombs ripped through two neighbourhoods of Damascus on Saturday, killing 27 people, according to an interior ministry toll. 
 
 An Observatory statement said fresh fighting erupted later on Monday between rebels and security forces in the Qaboon and Barzeh areas of Damascus. 
 
 Troops backed by dozens of tanks also raided districts of Deir Ezzor city in eastern Syria, the Observatory said, a day after at least 25 army deserters were killed in seizing its Hamidiyeh district. 
 
 Five soldiers, including two officers, were also killed, it said. 
 
 And troops bombarded the Bab Sbaa, Khalidiyeh and Karm al-Shami districts of Homs, the monitoring group said. 
 
 Troops in the northwestern province of Idlib attacked Abdita, home village of defector Colonel Riyadh Asaad, head of the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army, local activist Nurredin al-Abdo told AFP. 
 
 Security forces killed at least nine civilians on Monday -- including a young girl -- in Idlib, Homs and the southern province of Daraa, while a captain who deserted was killed in the central town of Rastan, the Observatory said. 
 
 Copyright © 2012 AFP. All rights reserved. More » ||||| Heavy fighting has broken out between opposition fighters and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in a main district of Damascus that is home to several security installations, witnesses said. 
 
 The sound of heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades echoed throughout the night from the western neighbourhood of al-Mezzeh, one of the most heavily guarded areas of the capital, residents told the Reuters news agency by telephone on Monday. 
 
 Syrian state television said three ""terrorists"" and a member of Syria's security forces were killed in the fighting. 
 
 Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), earlier said that at least 18 security troops were wounded. 
 
 Lena, a member of the Revolutionary Leadership Council in Damascus, an opposition activist network, told Al Jazeera that residents in al-Mezzeh began hearing gunfire at about midnight. 
 
 ""Some people came to al-Mezzeh and they are trying to attack residents. They are calling them names and taking them out of their houses ... people have left their homes. They are in the streets. The security forces are all around the place,"" she said. 
 
 Another witness who lives in the area said there was fighting near Hamada supermarket and the sound of explosions in nearby. ""Security police have blocked several side streets and the street lighting has been cut off,"" she said. 
 
 Reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon, Al Jazeera's Rula Amin said: ""Residents are telling us there was intense gunfire for hours. They could hear from loudspeakers the army and the security forces asking armed men to leave one of the buildings, Hamada supermarket. 
 
 ""Al-Mezzeh is not geographically located in the heart of the capital but it's a very important neighbourhood. It is heavily guarded. There are a lot of high-ranking officials living in al-Mezzeh, in addition to the UN headquarters, embassies, and ambassadors,"" she said. 
 
 ""This is taking place as the government claims they have control over the capital."" 
 
 'Damascus documents' 
 
 The latest fighting comes as Al Jazeera gained access to confidential documents prepared for Assad by his intelligence chiefs that give details of the regime's plans to contain the uprising and protect government strongholds. 
 
 The documents, running into hundreds of pages, point to a government desperate to keep control of the capital Damascus and include clear orders to stop protesters from getting into the city. 
 
 Elsewhere on Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Russia's foreign minister voiced clear support for a plan for daily humanitarian ceasefires in Syria and promised Russia would press Assad's government to accept it. 
 
 Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ""clearly agreed to and was supportive of"" the idea of a daily two-hour cessation of hostilities to allow for life-saving aid operations, ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger told Reuters after talks with Lavrov in Moscow on Monday. 
 
 Asked whether Lavrov had promised that Russia would pressure Syria's government on the plan, Kellenberger said, ""Yes, very much so"". 
 
 The two sides issued no joint statement but ICRC officials said Kellenberger ""received positive indications of support"" from Lavrov. 
 
 The Red Cross has yet to receive permission from Syria to access all parts of the country affected by fighting. Moscow, an ally of Damascus, is seen as having a certain amount of influence on the Syrian leadership. 
 
 Attacks 
 
 This came a day after Syria's opposition reported heavy raids by security forces and fighting with rebels in northern and southern provinces and suburbs of Damascus on Sunday. 
 
 A car bomb close to a state security office in Syria's second biggest city of Aleppo killed at least three people on Sunday, according to the SOHR. 
 
 Syrian state TV said that the""terrorist"" explosion took place between two residential buildings in the al-Suleimaniya district, behind a post office. 
 
 In Damascus, crowds gathered for memorials to the 27 victims of Saturday's car bombs, which had targeted a customs office and air force intelligence headquarters. 
 
 State television also blamed ""terrorists"" for those attacks, but opposition activists said they doubted armed groups trying to bring down Assad would have the capacity to carry out such operations against his security institutions in Damascus. 
 
 The United Nations estimates that more than 8,000 people have died so far in the violence following the revolt against four decades of rule by the Assad family. 
 
 Syrian authorities say they are fighting insurgents who have so far killed more than 2,000 members of the security forces.","– Machine guns and explosions were audible as violence overtook a high-security section of Damascus last night, killing at least three and wounding 18 Syrian troops. Locals began hearing gunfire at about midnight and say ""intensive gunfire"" continued for hours in the Mazzeh district of the Syrian capital, an upscale neighborhood home to several senior regime members. ""People came to Mazzeh and they are trying to attack residents. They are calling them names and taking them out of their houses,"" an opposition activist tells al-Jazeera. ""The clashes were the strongest and the closest to security installations in the capital since the outbreak of the revolt a year ago,"" a watchdog tells AFP. The fighting follows car bombs in Damascus and Syria's second-biggest city of Aleppo this weekend. Damascus hasn't faced the daily clashes reported in other Syrian cities, the AP notes. An activist said last night's violence was sparked by a Free Syrian Army hit-and-run effort, though state TV said it began with a security raid on an ""armed terrorist"" hideout. The clashes may have been a rebel attempt to damage security forces' morale after a series of effective attacks on the opposition, the AP suggests.",<pad> Damascus.</s>,0.014285713866326542,0.0,0.014285713866326542
291,"Recently, in teenage internet circles, the phrase “Netflix and chill” has been inescapable. 
 
 It’s a phrase that means, roughly, “hooking up.” But it’s a lot more complicated than that. “Netflix and chill” is a classic case of social media-fueled semantic drift. It began as a plain, descriptive phrase (“Can’t wait to leave work so I can watch Netflix and chill!”), and stayed that way for several years before acquiring a loose sexual connotation (“Wanna come over for Netflix and chill? ;)”) and, eventually becoming a known code phrase (“He said he loves me, but I know he just wants to Netflix and chill”). 
 
 As with most recent internet slang, “Netflix and chill” seems to have originated on Black Twitter before migrating to Instagram, Tumblr, Vine, and the outer reaches of Memeland. And in a way, it’s the perfect teenage shibboleth. If you were 16, and your parents caught you texting “Netflix and chill?” to your girlfriend, they might think you were proposing an innocent night of watching Chopped on the couch. 
 
 Let’s take a look at how “Netflix and chill” became every teen’s favorite euphemism for getting it on.

 Netflix begins offering a streaming video service, available for free to all subscribers.

 Netflix attempts the biggest rebranding in its history—separating its delivery-by-mail and streaming businesses, and renaming the delivery business “Qwikster”—but the effort is a disaster. Customers revolt, the decision is quickly reversed, and the entire business reverts to simply being called “Netflix.” 
 
 Seemingly unaware of any corporate-level turmoil, people on Twitter continue to talk about “Netflix and chill.” At this point, “Netflix and chill” has no alternate, subversive meaning. It’s just a two-word pairing, or, alternately, a verb phrase that means “to watch Netflix, while chilling.” And it’s usually performed alone. “Netflix and chill,” at this point, is an introvert’s metaphor for voluntary solitude.

 In order to turn on your TV and start Netflix in one swift motion, you'll need to send the same IR signal as the Netflix button on your TV remote. If you're not using a TV with a Netflix button or if you have an older TV, this may involve pressing more than one button—and you'll need to adjust accordingly. An easy way to obtain the IR signals is to read them. We like this method, which uses an IR receiver and an Arduino. ||||| Good news for adults who enjoy being treated like children: Netflix has invented a single button, ominously named “The Switch”, that will, if you choose to build your own, dim your lights, put your phone into “do not disturb” mode, order a takeaway and set you up for a night of viewing. The bad news: the button sounds pretty complicated – making one involves programming a microcontroller, figuring out your device’s infrared patterns and soldering together the electronics. 
 
 Even so, the internet has playfully dubbed it the “Netflix and chill” button, and its arrival represents the next stage in the life of a phrase that began as simply an innocent way of saying, “I’ve had a hard day and all I want to do this evening is put on Netflix, curl up into the foetal position and consume four straight hours of visual entertainment”, but has become an innuendo (and a meme) for hooking up. 
 
 In the innocent days of 2009, “Netflix and chill” really did mean “chilling out and watching Netflix”. It was a solo activity. There you were, sitting on your sofa, the latest season of whatever-it-is buzzing away in front of you, the “chill” part of the equation very much not a euphemism for anything at all. 
 
 The phrase has since become a 21st-century version of “Do you want to come up for some coffee?” In April, it was added to Urban Dictionary with the definition: “Code for two people going to each others houses and fucking or doing other sexual related acts.” 
 
 In 2014, when the euphemistic nature of the phrase was being established, gender lines began to form. Guys tweeted pictures of smug faces alongside captions such as, “When she says Netflix and chill”, while girls tweeted pictures of shocked, dismayed faces with captions such as, “When you find out what Netflix and chill means”. 
 
 This July, Netflix itself got in on the meme, posting a gif from the film Clueless, in which Alicia Silverstone’s character attempts to seduce a school friend while watching telly, only to tumble backwards off the bed, with the caption: “Netflix and chill? No, really”. 
 
 From there, Nicki Minaj caught on, posting a take on the meme to Instagram (503,000 likes), and the “and chill” half began being used in anything from “Lord of the Rings and chill” to “Ramen and chill”. The button, however, may be the death knell of the meme, marking the full corporate appropriation of the phrase. If that doesn’t do it, though, surely this will: across America, parents have started to figure out what it means. ||||| A subtle way to lure a girl to come over to your place, initially as just a ""friend"", so that it can lead to an opportunity of getting intimate with her while something is playing on Netflix.

For those of you not in the know, ""Netflix and chill"" is today's euphemism for hooking up, the Guardian reports. (And if you weren't previously in the know, you are not the only one.) Originally (think 2009), the phrase really did mean exactly what it sounds like: People used it to describe their lazy, solo, binge-watching evenings. Somehow, though, those three little words have morphed to the point that Urban Dictionary's definition is: ""It means that you are going to go over to your partners house and f--- with Netflix in the background.""

Like others around him, the freshman from Rockland thought it was just a fire drill, so he left his bag. But he grabbed his coat. 
 
 That made him luckier than some of the hundreds of Harvard students and faculty who were displaced at 9 a.m. by a bomb scare and walked out in their shirtsleeves or without their university ID cards, only to be locked out for hours as law enforcement swept the campus over what officials called “unconfirmed reports of explosives.” 
 
 Continue reading below 
 
 Police ultimately found no suspicious devices, but the threat, which officials said came via e-mail, drew an array of emergency responders and a throng of reporters to Harvard, eight months after the attack on the Boston Marathon. In Washington, President Obama was briefed. 
 
 Related Photos Police investigate reports of explosives at Harvard 
 
 But the mood on campus seemed to shift quickly from fear toward curiosity, annoyance, or indifference, long before the last of the four evacuated buildings was deemed bomb-free around 3 p.m. Almost from the start, officials called the evacuation a result of “an abundance of caution,” and many students speculated that the threat was an exam-period hoax. 
 
 “My guess is someone is trying to cause mischief during finals week,” said Nathan Pflueger, a graduate student who had just arrived at his office at the Science Center when the alarm went off, prompting a mass exodus. 
 
 “Ten-to-one it’s an obnoxious effort to stop an exam today,” said sophomore Connor Harris, standing outside the center five hours later, yellow caution tape and a cluster of emergency vehicles still blocking the entrance. 
 
 Harris said the atmosphere was “nothing like” that of last April, when the university and surrounding area was on lockdown during the manhunt in Watertown for the Marathon bombing suspects. “People were quite frightened” then, he said. 
 
 Continue reading below 
 
 But possibly because it took place at Harvard, the threat Monday made news worldwide. Harris awakened to read not just a university emergency alert message but also a text from his parents in Connecticut, hoping he was safe. Standing on the blocked-off end of Kirkland Street, he read a news story on his phone about the threat, in German, on the website of Der Spiegel. 
 
 The threat targeted Emerson, Thayer, and Sever halls in Harvard Yard and the Science Center, just beyond the yard. 
 
 Thayer and Emerson reopened after four hours, Sever after five, and the Science Center after six hours, though a heightened police and security presence remained well into the afternoon. 
 
 After the evacuation, officials closed Harvard Yard to the public, restricting access to those with university IDs. 
 
 By 11, a few dozen students were waiting along Massachusetts Avenue to return through one of the limited-access gates. Despite the helicopters overhead and the power cords for satellite trucks running down the sidewalk, the mood was the usual end-of-semester mix of jubilation and anxiety, with little evident fear. 
 
 Michael Casciotti, shivering in shorts and flip-flops, was just trying to stay warm. 
 
 “I’m very cold,” said the freshman from Pennsylvania, who had ventured barefoot and bleary-eyed from his Thayer dorm room into the hall at the sound of the alarm. 
 
 “I left all my stuff in there, didn’t have any clothes on, so my friend gave me a sweater and flip-flops,” he said. 
 
 As the three-hour mark approached, Palana, the freshman from Rockland, remained displaced from his bag and his dorm room, in Thayer. He had decamped for an upperclass dorm far from the yard — “I wasn’t too concerned, [but] I had some friends that were pretty scared” — but wandered back toward Harvard Yard for lunch, spotting a friend waving from the third floor of a dorm just inside the gate. A federal Homeland Security sport utility vehicle had just raced past, sirens blaring. But the friend, shirtless, appeared unconcerned. 
 
 “Hey, Adam!” Palana called. “You look not very cold. It’s not so warm out here.” 
 
 Palana glanced at his phone and saw an update: His exam had been rescheduled for a choice of 6:30 p.m. Monday night or the third week of next semester. 
 
 His classmate Emma Woo cringed; Monday’s new timing coincided with her chorus concert, so she would have to study again over break. “Dude, that’s the worst,” Palana said. 
 
 A Harvard e-mail advised students that afternoon exams would be held as scheduled, with exams in affected buildings moved but not canceled. 
 
 The Faculty of Arts and Sciences message advised students that if they felt unable to take their exams for any reason, “including anxiety, loss of study time, lack of access to material and belongings left in one of the affected buildings, or travel schedule,” they could skip the exam and take a grade based on coursework to date. 
 
 That prompted a group of graduate students to begin drafting a reply cautioning that the approach would “set up a new and dangerous precedent on campus, that bomb threats will get students out of final exam responsibilities.” 
 
 “We see the note as analogous to negotiating with terrorists,” doctoral student Alek Chakroff said in an e-mail to the Globe. “We sympathize with students who are distressed by the threats, especially in the wake of the Marathon bombings. But in responding to these threats, we think excusing students from exams should be the exception, not the rule.” 
 
 A subsequent Harvard e-mail reiterated the policy for students who skipped Monday afternoon exams but clarified that anyone who felt unable to take another exam this week as a result of the bomb threat would need evaluation and documentation from student mental health services. ||||| In the Event of an Emergency

 UPDATED: December 17, 2013, at 3:05 a.m. 
 
 An apparently unfounded emailed threat of live explosives in three academic buildings and one dormitory near the center of Harvard’s campus on Monday morning prompted exam cancellations in several large courses, the descent of federal, state, and local law enforcement, and a White House briefing. 
 
 Hundreds of Harvard College students were prematurely roused from bed or abruptly interrupted from their final examinations shortly after 9 a.m., when Harvard University Police sounded alarms in four campus buildings. The evacuations of the Science Center, Emerson Hall, Sever Hall, and Thayer Hall sent scores of students into Harvard Yard and the Science Center Plaza, leaving police to search the premises. With the developing situation attracting national media attention, little happened as a nearly six hour investigation yielded no explosive contraband and authorities issued the all-clear shortly before 3 in the afternoon. 
 
 According to department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, the threat came in an emailed message to an affiliate of HUPD that was timestamped, according to Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, at 8:40 a.m. 
 
 A Harvard spokesperson who declined to be identified confirmed that the email received by the HUPD affiliate was “nearly identical” to an email received at 8:45 a.m. by Crimson President Robert S. Samuels ’14. Under the subject line “bombs placed around campus,” the email to Samuels read, “bombs placed in: science center [and] sever hall [and] emerson hall [and] thayer hall. 2/4. guess correctly. be quick for they will go off soon.” 
 
 After the HUPD affiliate read the emailed threat, the department immediately dispatched officers because the email specifically named its targets, according to the Harvard spokesperson. Simultaneously with the dispatch, the spokesperson said, HUPD drafted a MessageMe alert to the Harvard community, the first of more than 10 emails that College students would receive from Harvard officials throughout the day. Repeatedly in those messages, administrators stressed that they were acting out of an “abundance of caution” in an effort to keep the campus community safe. 
 
 By the time that first MessageMe alert was sent at 9:02 a.m., HUPD officers had already started evacuating the targeted buildings. Another alert, at 9:13 a.m., reported that HUPD and Cambridge Police were on the scene and investigating. By noon, state and federal authorities had arrived on the scene, and President Obama had been briefed on the situation, according to a White House spokesperson. 
 
 Not long after the building evacuations, authorities closed Harvard Yard. Students evacuated from the Science Center who had initially thought the disturbance was nothing more than an ill-timed fire drill were directed to an Annenberg Hall that quickly overflowed from the combination of the usual breakfast rush and those displaced from exam rooms and bedrooms. 
 
 Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris soon joined the students in Annenberg, where he would later be joined by University President Drew G. Faust and interim College Dean Donald H. Pfister. After discussing the situation with a number of teaching staff, Harris climbed on a table and announced that all of the exams scheduled that morning in the three affected classroom buildings had been cancelled. During his impromptu speech, Harris did not settle definitively the question of whether cancelled exams would need to be made up. 
 
 Throughout the morning, students with exams scheduled for the day received emails from teaching fellows and professors, many of whom expressed uncertainty about how their courses would be graded, and if students would be required to make up exams. With three major academic buildings still shuttered, students slated to sit for finals at 2 p.m. were cast into an uncomfortable holding pattern. Just after 12 p.m., the University notified parents of undergraduates of the ongoing situation. 
 
 With the search turning up no evidence of explosives, life in the Yard began to return to normalcy as the day progressed. The Yard reopened to Yard residents before 11 a.m. And, at 12:40 p.m., Securitas guards stood by Johnston, Widener, Lamont, and the Science Center gates, allowing Harvard ID holders into the Yard. Shortly before noon, several dozen students could be found studying in Lamont Cafe, as well as in Lamont’s reading rooms. At least three others had fallen asleep, some at tables, others on couches. 
 
 Early in the afternoon, HUPD sent out alerts announcing that Emerson and Thayer, and then Sever and Harvard Yard, were safe for return, but officers continued to search the Science Center, forcing the cancellation of afternoon exams set to be held there. In an email to undergraduates just minutes before 2 p.m. exams were scheduled to start, Administrative Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison wrote that any students who felt unprepared to take their still-scheduled afternoon exams could be excused from the sitting. 
 
 Those who opted to forgo uncancelled afternoon exams, Ellison wrote, could choose to be graded on coursework to date, excluding the final, or to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis without penalty. In an email later in the afternoon, Ellison reiterated that the rest of the week’s exams remained scheduled. 
 
 Authorities finally cleared the Science Center at 2:44 p.m., effectively declaring an end to the campus scare. As of press time, Catalano would not comment on whether the investigation had turned up any suspects.

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service used DNA analysis to confirm that the dead canine was the celebrated collared female known as “914F” that wandered hundreds of miles from the Northern Rockies. The lone wolf, originally collared near Cody, Wyoming, was killed in December by a Utah hunter who claimed he mistook the predator for a coyote. 
 
 “It is nothing short of a tragedy that this wolf’s journey across the west was cut short because she was shot and killed by a coyote hunter,” said Eva Sargent, the southwest programs director for Defenders of Wildlife. “This brave and ambitious female gray wolf that made it all the way from Wyoming to the Grand Canyon had already become a symbol of what gray wolf recovery should look like – animals naturally dispersing to find suitable habitat.” 
 
 The tendency of hunters to mistake wolves for coyotes is a major issue, especially in California, where conservationists believe a pair of wolves and their offspring currently living across the Oregon border will eventually disperse. In June, the California Fish and Game Commission voted to list wolves under the California Endangered Species Act, a decision that gives conservationists some measure of comfort. Problem is, those protections don’t exist elsewhere. 
 
 The federal delisting of wolves in 2011 in the Northern Rockies led to a killing spree in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. More than 2,800 wolves have been killed in the northern Rockies, resulting in a 9 percent population decline, since federal protections were lifted there, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Minnesota has seen a 25 percent decline in its wolf population. 
 
 The federal government is now considering a proposal to strip Endangered Species Act protection from gray wolves throughout their range. 
 
 “Unfortunately, we have seen time and again that coyote hunting in habitat frequented by wolves is deadly for wolves,” Sargent said. “Sadly, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service preparing to remove all protections for gray wolves, except for Mexican gray wolves, in the near future, it will become harder and harder for wolves to travel safely, and less and less likely that we will hear their howls echo through places like the Grand Canyon.” 
 
 Gray wolves, which once roamed across the continent, were exterminated in the lower 48 states, except Minnesota, in the 19th and early 20th centuries largely to protect livestock. The last known native California wolf was trapped and killed in Lassen County in 1924. 
 
 In 1995, 66 Canadian wolves were released in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in an attempt to bring the apex predator back. They have since moved into northeastern Oregon, where there are more than two dozen wolves in a handful of packs, but the population is still far below the two million that once lived across North America. ||||| CLOSE New rules expand the territory of the endangered Mexican gray wolf beyond a limited area of New Mexico and Arizona, to the Mexican border and Texas State line.

 Hunter says he mistook the wolf for a coyote 
 
 Wolf was one of first seen in northern Arizona in decades 
 
 Officials have confirmed that the female gray wolf killed in December by a hunter in southern Utah is the same one that had traveled hundreds of miles from Wyoming to the Grand Canyon, where it became the first gray wolf seen in northern Arizona in 70 years. 
 
 The confirmation was made after geneticists compared DNA from the wolf killed in Utah with samples taken from the wolf near the Grand Canyon, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said today. 
 
 The results were ""conclusive that it is the same wolf, identified by the Service as 914F,"" which was collared near Cody, Wyo., on Jan. 8, 2014, and spotted in the Grand Canyon area in the fall of last year, the agency said in a statement. 
 
 A hunter who said he mistook the animal for a coyote shot and killed the wolf in the Tushar Mountains outside of Beaver, Utah, about 200 miles north of the Grand Canyon, officials have said.

 The 3-year-old wolf was wearing a radio collar, and had become a symbol of hope for recovery of the federally protected species. 
 
 The wolf was first collared last January in Wyoming and had traveled some 450 miles to reach northern Arizona, most likely in search of food or a mate, federal officials have said. The wolf was spotted in October and photographed by visitors and hunters on the Kaibab Plateau north of the Grand Canyon National Park.

As the ancestor of the domestic dog, the gray wolf resembles German shepherds or malamutes. Though they once nearly disappeared from the lower 48 states, today wolves have returned to the Great Lakes, northern Rockies and Southwestern United States. 
 
 Wolves play a key role in keeping ecosystems healthy. They help keep deer and elk populations in check, which can benefit many other plant and animal species. The carcasses of their prey also help to redistribute nutrients and provide food for other wildlife species, like grizzly bears and scavengers. Scientists are just beginning to fully understand the positive ripple effects that wolves have on ecosystems. 
 
 Diet 
 
 Wolves eat ungulates, or large hoofed mammals, like elk, deer, moose and caribou, as well as beaver, rabbits and other small prey. Wolves are also scavengers and often eat animals that have died due to other causes. 
 
 Population 
 
 Did You Know? Wolves have unique howls, like fingerprints, that scientists (and other pack members) can use to tell them apart. 
 
 There are an estimated 7,000 to 11,200 gray wolves in Alaska, 3,700 in the Great Lakes region and 1,675 in the Northern Rockies. 
 
 Habitat & Range 
 
 Gray wolves were once common throughout all of North America, but were exterminated in most areas of the United States by the mid 1930s. Today, their range has been reduced to Canada, Alaska, the Great Lakes, northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest. Thanks to the reintroduction of wolves in 1995, Yellowstone National Park is one of the most favored places to see and hear wolves in their native habitat. Wolves require large areas of contiguous habitat that can include forests and mountainous terrain, and Mexican gray wolves can thrive in desert and brush in the southwest. Suitable habitat must have sufficient access to prey, protection from excessive persecution, and areas for denning and taking shelter. 
 
 Did You Know? The alpha female and alpha male wolves of a pack usually mate for life. 
 
 Behavior 
 
 Wolves live, travel and hunt in packs of 7 to 8 animals on average. Packs include the mother and father wolves (called the alphas), their pups and older offspring. The alpha female and male are typically the pack leaders that track and hunt prey, choose den sites and establish the pack's territory. Wolves develop strong social bonds within their packs. 
 
 
 
 Wolves have a complex communication system ranging from barks and whines to growls and howls. While they don't actually howl at the moon, they are more active at dawn and dusk, and they do howl more when it's lighter at night, which occurs more often when the moon is full.","– Hundred of miles from its Wyoming home, ""914F"" wandered to the rocky North Rim of the Grand Canyon last fall—the first gray wolf spotted there in 70 years, the Arizona Republic notes—before heading into Utah, likely searching for food or a mate. But in December, the wolf's journey came to an end after a hunter there mistook her for a coyote and shot her dead, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Using DNA testing, the US Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed the 3-year-old collared animal was the same one seen at the Grand Canyon, the Republic notes. ""It is nothing short of a tragedy that this wolf's journey across the west was cut short,"" Eva Sargent, a director for Defenders of Wildlife, tells the Chronicle. ""This brave and ambitious female gray wolf … had already become a symbol of what gray wolf recovery should look like: animals naturally dispersing to find suitable habitat."" Gray wolves weren't always isolated to certain parts of the country: All of North America used to be their home, Defenders of Wildlife notes, but they were killed off throughout much the US in the 1930s. What's worrying some animal advocates is that the federal government is considering removing endangered-species status from gray wolves in all regions: When they were delisted from the Northern Rockies, mass killings of the creatures took place in multiple states, including Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. ""Sadly, with the US Fish and Wildlife Service preparing to remove all protections for gray wolves, except for Mexican gray wolves, in the near future, it will become harder and harder for wolves to travel safely, and less … likely that we will hear their howls echo through places like the Grand Canyon,"" Sargent tells the Chronicle.

294,"Mr. McGahn was also concerned that firing the special counsel would incite more questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia investigation. 
 
 Around the time Mr. Trump wanted to fire Mr. Mueller, the president’s legal team, led then by his longtime personal lawyer in New York, Marc E. Kasowitz, was taking an adversarial approach to the Russia investigation. The president’s lawyers were digging into potential conflict-of-interest issues for Mr. Mueller and his team, according to current and former White House officials, and news media reports revealed that several of Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors had donated to Democrats. 
 
 Mr. Mueller could not legally have considered political affiliations when making hiring decisions. But for Mr. Trump’s supporters, it reinforced the idea that, although Mr. Mueller is a Republican, he had assembled a team of Democrats to take down the president. 
 
 Another option that Mr. Trump considered in discussions with his advisers was dismissing the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, and elevating the Justice Department’s No. 3 official, Rachel Brand, to oversee Mr. Mueller. Mr. Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since March, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. 
 
 Mr. Trump has significantly ratcheted back his criticisms of Mr. Mueller since he hired Mr. Cobb for his legal team in July. A veteran of several high-profile Washington controversies, Mr. Cobb has known Mr. Mueller for decades, dating to their early careers in the Justice Department. 
 
 He advised Mr. Trump that he had nothing to gain from combat with Mr. Mueller, a highly respected former prosecutor and F.B.I. director who has subpoena power as special counsel. Since Mr. Cobb’s arrival, the White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear the cloud of suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, not to fight him. ||||| President Trump sought the firing of Robert S. Mueller III last June, shortly after the special counsel took over the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and he backed off only after White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn threatened to resign over the move. 
 
 The extraordinary showdown was confirmed by two people familiar with the episode, which was first reported by the New York Times. 
 
 McGahn did not deliver his resignation threat directly to Trump but was serious about his threat to leave, according to a person familiar with the episode. 
 
 Trump denied the report Friday when asked about it during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
 
 ""Fake news, folks. Fake news,"" Trump told reporters. 
 
 The president's effort to fire the special counsel came in the weeks after Mueller's appointment last May to lead the probe into whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russian attempts to tilt the election. Mueller was tapped for the role by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein after Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey. 
 
 The special counsel probe has quickly expanded to include an exploration of whether Trump has attempted to obstruct the ongoing investigation — a line of inquiry that could now include the president's threats to fire Mueller himself. 
 
 Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel's office, declined to comment. McGahn did not respond to requests for comment. 
 
 A White House spokesman referred questions to Ty Cobb, the attorney coordinating the administration's response to the Russia investigations, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment. John Dowd, an attorney for the president, declined to comment. 
 
 Democrats late Thursday renewed their calls for Congress to pass legislation to protect Mueller and future special counsels from being fired by the president. At least two such bills have been introduced in recent months by members of both parties. 
 
 Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation of Russian interference, said in a statement that ""firing the Special Counsel is a red line that the President cannot cross. Any attempt to remove the Special Counsel, pardon key witnesses, or otherwise interfere in the investigation, would be a gross abuse of power, and all members of Congress, from both parties, have a responsibility to our Constitution and to our country to make that clear immediately."" 
 
 Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a former state attorney general, described Trump's attempt to oust Mueller as ""remarkable and stunning,"" adding in an interview, ""it shows the need immediately to protect the special counsel."" 
 
 Republican Rep. Charlie Dent (Pa.) said in an interview that McGahn ""prevented an Archibald Cox moment,"" referring to the special prosecutor ordered fired by President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate investigation. 
 
 ""I believe now that this revelation has been made public, that there will be increasing pressure to protect Mueller,"" Dent added. 
 
 Trump was initially calm when Mueller was appointed, surprising White House aides, according to a senior administration official. 
 
 But in the weeks that followed, the president spoke with a number of friends and advisers who convinced him that Mueller would dig through his private finances and look beyond questions of collusion with Russians. They warned that the probe could last years and would ruin his first term in office. 
 
 At the time, Trump's legal team was urging him to take an aggressive posture toward the special counsel and was compiling arguments about why Mueller could not be impartial. Among the points cited: an allegation that Mueller had gotten into a dispute over membership fees before he resigned from a Trump-owned golf course in Northern Virginia in 2011. 
 
 The dispute was hardly a dispute at all. According to a person familiar with the matter, Mueller had sent a letter requesting a dues refund in accordance with normal club practice and never heard back. 
 
 [Trump team seeks to control, block Mueller’s Russia investigation] 
 
 Trump's ire at Mueller rose to such a level that then-White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon and then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus grew ""incredibly concerned"" that he was going to fire Mueller and sought to enlist others to intervene with the president, according to a Trump adviser who requested anonymity to describe private conversations. 
 
 Both of the men were deeply worried about the possibility and discussed how to keep him from making such a move, this person said. 
 
 Priebus and Bannon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
 
 In one meeting with other advisers, Bannon raised the concern that if Trump fired Mueller it could trigger a challenge to his presidency based on the 25th Amendment, which lays out the process of who succeeds a president in case of incapacitation. 
 
 Despite internal objections, Trump decided to assert that Mueller had unacceptable conflicts of interest and moved to remove him from his position, according to the people familiar with the discussions. 
 
 In response, McGahn said he would not remain at the White House if Trump went through with the move, according to a senior administration official. 
 
 The president, in turn, backed off. 
 
 Since then, Trump brought in a new legal team that has counseled cooperation with Mueller. He has continued to fume about the investigation, even as his lawyers have publicly pledged to work with the special counsel. On Thursday, Dowd released a memo outlining the administration's commitment to transparency, noting that more than 20 White House officials have voluntarily given interviews. 
 
 But the revelation that Trump tried to fire Mueller could be a critical piece of evidence for the special counsel as he tries to build an obstruction case, said white-collar criminal defense attorney Jacob Frenkel, who previously worked in the Office of Independent Counsel. 
 
 ""In the jigsaw puzzle of circumstantial evidence of criminal intent, these are more pieces that Mueller certainly would use,"" Frenkel said. ""You build it around the timing."" 
 
 The president's attorneys will probably try to argue that Trump was merely responding to current events, without intending to impede anything, Frenkel added. 
 
 ""The defense would be this was merely an emotional response that's reflective of the frustration about the ongoing investigation and its distraction from the ability to govern,"" he said. 
 
 Robert Costa, Ed O'Keefe, Philip Rucker, Sean Sullivan and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.","– President Trump tried to fire the man overseeing the Russia investigation last year but backed off after the chief White House lawyer threatened to quit, the New York Times reports, citing four sources who ""spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation."" The sources say that when Trump ordered the firing of Robert Mueller in June, White House Counsel Donald McGahn said he would quit before he asked the Justice Department to fire the special counsel. Trump argued that Mueller had multiple conflicts of interests, including an alleged dispute over fees that caused him to resign his membership at the Trump National Golf Club years earlier and his work at the law firm that represented Jared Kushner, the sources say. The White House has repeatedly denied that Trump tried to fire Mueller after his investigators began looking into whether the president had obstructed justice, the Times notes.

 The theory underpinning the idea was first described 80 years ago by two physicists who later worked on the first atomic bomb. At the time they considered the conversion of light into matter impossible in a laboratory. 
 
 But in a report published on Sunday, physicists at Imperial College London claim to have cracked the problem using high-powered lasers and other equipment now available to scientists. 
 
 ""We have shown in principle how you can make matter from light,"" said Steven Rose at Imperial. ""If you do this experiment, you will be taking light and turning it into matter."" 
 
 The scientists are not on the verge of a machine that can create everyday objects from a sudden blast of laser energy. The kind of matter they aim to make comes in the form of subatomic particles invisible to the naked eye. 
 
 The original idea was written down by two US physicists, Gregory Breit and John Wheeler, in 1934. They worked out that – very rarely – two particles of light, or photons, could combine to produce an electron and its antimatter equivalent, a positron. Electrons are particles of matter that form the outer shells of atoms in the everyday objects around us. 
 
 But Breit and Wheeler had no expectations that their theory would be proved any time soon. In their study, the physicists noted that the process was so rare and hard to produce that it would be ""hopeless to try to observe the pair formation in laboratory experiments"". 
 
 Oliver Pike, the lead researcher on the study, said the process was one of the most elegant demonstrations of Einstein's famous relationship that shows matter and energy are interchangeable currencies. ""The Breit-Wheeler process is the simplest way matter can be made from light and one of the purest demonstrations of E=mc2,"" he said. 
 
 Writing in the journal Nature Photonics, the scientists describe how they could turn light into matter through a number of separate steps. The first step fires electrons at a slab of gold to produce a beam of high-energy photons. Next, they fire a high-energy laser into a tiny gold capsule called a hohlraum, from the German for ""empty room"". This produces light as bright as that emitted from stars. In the final stage, they send the first beam of photons into the hohlraum where the two streams of photons collide. 
 
 The scientists' calculations show that the setup squeezes enough particles of light with high enough energies into a small enough volume to create around 100,000 electron-positron pairs. 
 
 The process is one of the most spectacular predictions of a theory called quantum electrodynamics (QED) that was developed in the run up to the second world war. ""You might call it the most dramatic consequence of QED and it clearly shows that light and matter are interchangeable,"" Rose told the Guardian. 
 
 The scientists hope to demonstrate the process in the next 12 months. There are a number of sites around the world that have the technology. One is the huge Omega laser in Rochester, New York. But another is the Orion laser at Aldermaston, the atomic weapons facility in Berkshire. 
 
 A successful demonstration will encourage physicists who have been eyeing the prospect of a photon-photon collider as a tool to study how subatomic particles behave. ""Such a collider could be used to study fundamental physics with a very clean experimental setup: pure light goes in, matter comes out. The experiment would be the first demonstration of this,"" Pike said. 
 
 Andrei Seryi, director of the John Adams Institute at Oxford University, said: ""It's breathtaking to think that things we thought are not connected, can in fact be converted to each other: matter and energy, particles and light. Would we be able in the future to convert energy into time and vice versa?""","– Scientists are on the brink of turning light into matter—a process first theorized in 1934 but then described by the very men behind the idea as ""hopeless to try."" The subatomic particles the Imperial College London physicists say they've figured out how to produce will not be visible to the naked eye, but will be ""one of the purest demonstrations of E=mc2,"" Einstein’s famous equation describing the ""interchangeable"" relationship between mass and energy, the Guardian reports. They think they can attempt the feat in the next 12 months using existing technologies. What'll happen in general: Two particles of light (photons) will be smashed together to create an electron-positron pair, known as a Breit-Wheeler pair in honor of the earlier researchers, Americans Gregory Breit and John Wheeler. The specifics of the process: First a stream of electrons will be fired into a slab of gold, creating a high-energy photon beam; then, a high-energy laser will be fired into a gold can called a hohlraum, creating light akin to what stars emit. The first beam will then be directed into the center of the can, and the two photon sources will collide. What emerges from the can: electrons and positrons. It is ""a very clean experiment: pure light goes in, pure matter comes out. This experiment would be the first demonstration of this,” says physicist Oliver Pike. In a letter about their plans published in Nature Photonics, Pike and his colleagues say they are ushering in ""the advent of a new type of high-energy physics experiment.""

 Security officials quickly pulled the man away as he tried to hide under Ferrera's voluminous gown before the Friday premiere of ""How to Train Your Dragon 2."" 
 
 It was a bizarre incident on a red carpet renowned for its strict decorum. The man was later identified as Vitalii Sediuk, a Ukrainian prankster known for such stunts. 
 
 Yet Ferrera didn't seem ruffled on the carpet and was in good spirits at the movie's after-party, laughing with guests and taking pictures. 
 
 She declined comment on the incident, however, and festival organizers didn't immediately return messages about the matter. 
 
 The former ""Ugly Betty"" star was on her way into the Palais des Festivals for the world premiere of the DreamWorks animated sequel. ||||| The weirdest part of a story the New York Post just published about an incident on the red carpet at Cannes is not that it happened at all. Sadly, the news that a man tried to get under America Ferrera’s dress is not actually shocking in a media moment where paparazzi regularly take, and sell, crotch shots of female celebrities. It is that the Post is referring to the guy who did this, Ukranian Vitalii Sediuk, as a journalist, saying “a reputation for putting celebrities in comprising positions as part of his shtick.”

 It is true that Sediuk’s career — or at least, his place in the headlines — mostly consists of sexually harassing celebrities, male and female alike. Just because some people think that Will Smith is gay and closeted does not mean that it is in any way reportage to try to plant a kiss on him at a movie premiere. And I have no idea what it is supposed to be when Sediuk puts his face on Bradley Cooper’s crotch on the red carpet. 
 
 These are not only totally unrevealing stunts, if that is what they are supposed to be. They are assault. Just because they happen to men as well as well as women does not mean they should be treated as examples of puckishness or pranksterism. 
 
 It is true that much of the time, Sediuk is crashing the events where he causes a scene. He apparently had a credentials pass in Cannes, though it is not yet clear if any organization actually granted it to him directly, or if Sediuk got his hands on someone else’s badge. When he tried to ruin Adele’s Grammy’s acceptance speech, it was just as a crasher. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences took steps to legally bar him from the 2013 ceremony. 
 
 It is not particularly clear who Sediuk is working for at any given time. In 2012, he was affiliated with Russia Life News. In 2013, he was apparently presenting himself as a Eurovision correspondent. At other times, he has apparently worked for 1+1, based in Ukraine. That rotating roster of employers, or at least of assignments, seems in keeping with Sediuk’s actual professional seriousness. But it gets at a larger problem for entertainment journalism. 
 
 It is a wonderful thing that there is a global market for American movies, and the global press attention for American actors that comes with it. That interest, coupled with the founding of a dizzying number of Web-based publications, creates both opportunities and dilemmas for American networks, studios, and entertainment festivals and conferences. 
 
 This means that the entertainment industry can prioritize smaller friendly outlets, giving them opportunities and denying them to more established, and critical, organizations. It also means studios and networks have to pay more attention to foreign journalists who help ensure an ever-bigger part of their box office or advertising. These pressures are one of the reasons the Golden Globe Awards, the ceremony run by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, is such a big draw despite the often-odd choices made by its voting pool. The lines between reporting and stenography can get blurred, given these pressures — as can the lines between reporting and pranksterism. 
 
 Big organizations like the Academy and the Grammys seem to have figured out that Sediuk, at least, is not a journalist, refusing him credentials and alerting security to his tactics, even if those briefings are not always successful. Outlets like the Post and the Hollywood Reporter, which has emerged as both buzzy and serious under the leadership of Janice Min, should make the same call, naming Sediuk for what he is. 
 
 The entertainment industry and the journalists who cover it are not always going to be on the same page about who should get credentials and what constitutes reporting. Journalists, who have a range of assignments, will not always agree on these questions either. But I hope we can reach a basic consensus that Vitalii Sediuk does not deserve the title that still gets attached to him, and that harassing and assaulting stars may be vigorous, but it is not reporting. ||||| The ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" actress was accosted by infamous prankster Vitalii Sediuk who stuck his head under her skirt at the premiere.

 Yet at the afterparty on the beach in front of the Carlton Hotel, Ferrera was all smiles, and gushing about the glamorous premiere, where her film received a strong standing ovation. 
 
 ""It's fine -- I'm over it,"" she said when The Hollywood Reporter asked about the incident. 
 
 Ferrera says she'd been nervous heading into her first time at the festival, and had even done some reading on how to walk the red carpet. 
 
 ""I think it's impossible to not be nervous,"" she told THR at the afterparty. ""I would say this and the Oscars are the two most iconic red carpets in the industry."" 
 
 She stood next to Cannes vet Cate Blanchett at the start of the carpet. Ferrera, who voices the girlfriend of Jay Baruchel's character, had just met Blanchett that day.

 The cast began to walk the carpet in the traditional line, posing for the hundreds of photographers, when all of a sudden, Sediuk rushed under Ferrera's skirt. Sources say he grabbed her ankles before security pried him off. 
 
 The minute it happened, Blanchett was the first to turn around to attempt to push him away, and quickly turned to make sure Ferrera was alright. Ferrera says most of the cast immediately checked in with her. 
 
 ""They were all so supportive. They all just wanted to know I was okay,"" she said.

 America Ferrera got quite the shock on Friday when Ukrainian journalist Vitalii Sediuk stuck his head under her dress while she posed for photos on the red carpet. 
 
 Yeah that's 100% not okay. 
 
 Ferrera, 30, lined up with her ""How to Train Your Dragon 2″ costars arm-in-arm to pose for photographers at The Palais des Festivals. As she smiled for a sea of flashes, Sediuk weaseled his way on to the red carpet and slipped under the hem of her poofy white dress.

 Why is this guy allowed at press events? What's his fucking damage? ||||| Vitalii Sediuk strikes again. 
 
 The 25-year-old Ukrainian journalist somehow made his way onto the red carpet at the 20th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in L.A. on Saturday, Jan. 18. Once there, he wrapped his arms around an unsuspecting Bradley Cooper and nestled his face in the Silver Linings Playbook star's crotch. 
 
 Cooper, 39, initially appeared to laugh off the gag as his American Hustle costar Michael Peña and actor Mandy Patinkin look on in disbelief. They then helped Cooper pry Sediuk from the actor's legs. 
 
 Given his past antics, Sediuk's SAG Awards stunt was relatively tame.","– America Ferrera endured the creepiest kind of celebrity treatment on the red carpet at Cannes yesterday when a man dove under her dress, reports AP.

At the Washington Post, Alyssa Rosenberg is not amused by Sediuk, who also once placed his face in Bradley Cooper's crotch. ""These are not only totally unrevealing stunts, if that is what they are supposed to be,"" she writes. ""They are assault.

 Yesterday afternoon, I went to the White House and asked the President to be allowed, for personal reasons, to resign from my position as D/CIA. After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours. This afternoon, the President graciously accepted my resignation. 
 
 As I depart Langley, I want you to know that it has been the greatest of privileges to have served with you, the officers of our Nation’s Silent Service, a work force that is truly exceptional in every regard. Indeed, you did extraordinary work on a host of critical missions during my time as director, and I am deeply grateful to you for that. 
 
 Teddy Roosevelt once observed that life’s greatest gift is the opportunity to work hard at work worth doing. I will always treasure my opportunity to have done that with you and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end. 
 
 Thank you for your extraordinary service to our country, and best wishes for continued success in the important endeavors that lie ahead for our country and our Agency.

 David H. Petraeus ||||| Editor's note: Retired Gen. David Petraeus stepped down Friday as head of the Central Intelligence Agency - 14 months after taking the job, days after the presidential election and days before he was to testify before Congress about an attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya that left four Americans dead. 
 
 [Updated at 7:59 p.m.] Speaking on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" Rep. Peter King (R-New York) called Petraeus' resignation ""a real loss for the country, a real loss for the CIA."" 
 
 ""We're going to lose the best man for the job, but again America is adaptable,"" said the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""Put it this way, anytime you lose a David Petraeus, the country is not as safe as it could be."" 
 
 [Updated at 7:11 p.m.] The FBI investigated a tip that the woman Petraeus was involved in an extramarital affair with was Paula Broadwell, who co-wrote a biography about him, a U.S. official said. 
 
 Broadwell spent a year with Petraeus in Afghanistan, interviewing him for the book ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus."" 
 
 CNN has not been been able to reach Broadwell for comment. It is not clear if Broadwell is the woman with whom Petraeus had admitting having an affair, leading to his resignation Friday as the head of the CIA. 
 
 [Updated at 5:43 p.m.] After getting a tip that Petraeus was involved in an extramarital affair, the FBI launched an investigation to see if this relationship posed a ""potential security risk,"" a U.S. official said. The official added there is no suggestion the FBI was probing Petraeus for any criminal wrongdoing, only because they feared he might be ""in a vulnerable spot."" 
 
 [Updated at 5:40 p.m.] The woman who David Petraeus had an affair with was not a member of the armed forces or the CIA, sources close to Petraeus told HLN's Kyra Phillips. The retired general is extremely disappointed in himself and devastated that he's hurt his family, the sources say. 
 
 [Updated at 4:52 p.m.] Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell will testify next week before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the fatal attack in Benghazi instead of David Petraeus, according to the office of that committee's chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
 
 [Updated at 4:25 p.m.] U.S. Sen. John McCain extolled Petraeus as one of ""America's greatest military heroes,"" expressing his gratitude for his ""decades of work on behalf of our nation, our military and our security."" McCain, an Arizona Republican and the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, added, ""His inspirational leadership and his genius were directly responsible - after years of failure - for the success of the surge in Iraq."" 
 
 [Updated at 3:59 p.m.] Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, ""I wish President Obama had not accepted this resignation, but I understand and respect the decision."" 
 
 The California Democrat praised Petraeus for giving the CIA ""leadership, stature, prestige and credibility both at home and abroad,"" calling him reliably in ""command of intelligence issues"" and ""especially cooperative with Congress."" 
 
 [Updated at 3:53 p.m.] The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee praised outgoing CIA Director David Petraeus, saying, ""I regret his resignation and wish him and his family the very best."" 
 
 ""Gen. Petraeus is one of America's most outstanding and distinguished military leaders and a true American patriot,"" said Rep. Peter King, a Republican from New York. 
 
 
 
 [Updated at 3:41 p.m.] David Petraeus met with President Barack Obama on Thursday, at which time the then CIA director offered his resignation, a senior administration official said. The president then formally accepted Petraeus' resignation in a phone call Friday afternoon, according to the same official. 
 
 [Updated at 3:38 p.m.] President Obama said, in a statement, that today he accepted Petraeus' resignation as CIA director. 
 
 The president added he is ""completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission,"" now under the leadership of Acting Director Michael Morrell. 
 
 Obama lauded Petraeus for his ""extraordinary service to the United States for decades,"" calling him ""one of the outstanding general officers of his generation"" and praising his work as CIA director. 
 
 The president concluded by saying, ""Going forward, my thoughts and prayers are with Dave and Holly Petraeus, who has done so much to help military families through her own work. I wish them the very best in this difficult time."" Holly Petraeus led the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Office for Servicemembers Affairs. 
 
 [Updated at 3:17 p.m.] Shortly before Petraeus' resignation was announced, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters that ""the president thinks Gen. Petraeus has done an excellent job."" 
 
 When asked about the general's job status, Carney reiterated that President Obama approves of the job done by the CIA director while adding, ""I don't have personnel announcements to make from here today."" 
 
 [Updated at 3:13 p.m.] Petraeus issued a statement announcing his resignation, saying, ""After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. 
 
 ""Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours. This afternoon, the president graciously accepted my resignation."" 
 
 [Initial post, 3:08 p.m.] CIA Director David Petraeus submitted his resignation Friday to President Barack Obama, citing personal reasons, a U.S. government source said. 
 
 According to the source, Petraeus admitted to having an extramarital affair when he asked to resign. 
 
 A retired U.S. Army general who served as the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, Petraeus was sworn in as the head of the CIA in September 2011. 
 
 Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement Friday confirming that Petraeus had turned in his resignation, saying his ""decision to step down represents the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants."" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

 WASHINGTON -- CIA Director David Petraeus resigned Friday, citing an extramarital affair and ""extremely poor judgment."" 
 
 As first reported by NBC News, Petraeus disclosed the affair in a letter released to the CIA work force on Friday afternoon, writing: ""Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours."" 
 
 Petraeus told President Barack Obama of his affair and offered his resignation during a meeting Thursday, a senior official told NBC News. 
 
 In a statement, Obama said he accepted Petraeus’s resignation on Friday. 
 
 ""By any measure, through his lifetime of service, David Petraeus has made our country safer and stronger,"" Obama said of the four-star general, who led American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 
 Petraeus' biographer, Paula Broadwell, is under FBI investigation for improperly trying to access his email and possibly gaining access to classified information, law enforcement officials told NBC News on Friday. She is the author of Petraeus' biography, ""All In."" Broadwell had extensive access to Petraeus in Afghanistan and has given numerous television interviews speaking about him. 
 
 Law enforcement and multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that emails between Petraeus and Broadwell were indicative of an extra-marital affair. 
 
 Broadwell could not be reached by NBC News for comment. 
 
 David Petraeus a battlefield 'hero' and savvy Washington insider 
 
 Petraeus himself is not under investigation. 
 
 A U.S. military official and long-time aide to Petraeus told NBC News the director resigned ""because he screwed up."" 
 
 ""In his mind, in his views, with his code of ethics and morals, he did a very dishonorable thing,"" the official said. ""This had nothing to do with Benghazi, nothing to do with his relationship with the White House."" 
 
 Petraeus was appointed CIA director in April 2011, replacing Leon Panetta, who moved to the Pentagon to become defense secretary. 
 
 Petraeus served as commander of the war in Afghanistan in 2010-2011. Before that, he served as commander of the U.S. Central Command and as the commanding general of U.S. forces in Iraq. Because of those roles, he was seen as bringing a “customer’s eye” to the intelligence job. 
 
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC News that Petraeus’s personal mistake should not have led to his departure. 
 
 ""I would have stood up for him,"" Feinstein said in response to his indiscretion. ""I wanted him to continue. He was good, he loved the work, and he had a command of intelligence issues second to none.""

 Feinstein said she respects Obama’s decision to accept the Petraeus resignation, but wishes he hadn't. 
 
 She also said Petraeus will not need to testify at hearings she is chairing next week into the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the attack. 
 
 Rep. Peter King, R-NY, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said he regrets Petraeus's resignation. ""General Petraeus is one of America's most outstanding and distinguished military leaders and a true American patriot,"" King said in a statement. 
 
 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said it was Petraus's ""genius"" that was responsible ""for the success of the surge in Iraq."" 
 
 ""General David Petraeus will stand in the ranks of America's greatest military heroes,"" McCain said in a statement. 
 
 Multiple sources tell NBC News that Mike Morrell, the deputy CIA director and a longtime CIA officer, would likely be offered the job as acting director, with the understanding that he may be elevated to the job permanently. 
 
 That's how George Tenet got the job, first as deputy director in July 1995, then acting director following the resignation of John Deutch in December 1996 and finally as director in July 1997, staying on in the Bush administration. 
 
 Morrell is a longtime CIA analyst and was an eyewitness to two of the most momentous events in recent U.S. history. He was traveling with President George W. Bush on Sept. 11, 2001, as the president's briefer, and was in the Situation Room on May 1, 2011, as deputy CIA Director, when Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden. 
 
 Morell began his agency career as an analyst tracking international energy issues and subsequently worked for 14 years as an analyst and manager on East Asia. In 1999, he was appointed director of the Office of Asian Pacific and Latin American Analysis. He also has served as a presidential briefer, as chief of the staff that produces the president's daily briefing, and as an executive assistant to CIA Director George J. Tenet. 
 
 From 2003 until 2006, he served overseas. Upon his return, he was briefly deputy director for intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center before being asked to become associate deputy director at the CIA.

 The Gilbert dog kennel where 20 dogs perished last weekend continued to accept other pets into their care after the other pets had died, according to a woman who left her dogs at the facility hours before Maricopa County deputies responded to the kennel. 
 
 Snow Aubel, 33, said she phoned the Green Acre Dog Boarding facility to confirm her pets' drop-off time at about 10 a.m. Saturday morning and told the facility's owner, Todd Hughes, she could be there within the hour. That was no problem, he said, and nothing seemed amiss at the facility when she arrived on schedule.

 About two hours later, deputies from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office would swarm the property, transporting blanketed, dead dogs in wheelbarrow gurneys. They are said to have been dead since late Thursday night or early Friday morning. 
 
 ""He never said anything about what was going on,"" Aubel said of Hughes. ""He just took my dogs."" 
 
 The kennel's owners did not respond to request for comment at their home and over the phone on Thursday. 
 
 In total, 20 of the 28 dogs the Sheriff's Office found at the facility perished. Aubel's were alive. 
 
 Her 7-year-old Weimaraner, Cheyenne, and 6-year-old Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Yepa, would remain at the facility until Sunday afternoon, when a representative from Rover, the canine-booking site Aubel used to make the reservation, called to say they would be finding the dogs' accommodations elsewhere. 
 
 Aubel, who is a relative of an azcentral.com employee, said she was never contacted by the owners or the Sheriff's Office, and was unaware of the situation until Rover relayed the news. 
 
 Sheriff Joe Arpaio said deputies did not take custody of the living dogs away from the facility because it was, and is still, unknown whether a crime had occurred. 
 
 ""We haven't proven any cruelty,"" he said. ""Usually if we arrest people on cruelty we put [the dogs] in our air-conditioned jail, but we haven't proven anything."" 
 
 Aubel said Cheyenne and Yepa seemed at ease just before she left — Cheyenne darted off to chase a goose and Yepa chewed on some grass. Later she would see photos online of her two animals, alive with at least five others, in small, tiled room. 
 
 Other photos, released by the Sheriff's Office but deemed too graphic to be published by many media outlets, show the crammed carcasses of several other dogs, stored in a shed. 
 
 Workers told investigators that the dogs were last checked on Thursday night at about 11 p.m., and that by 5:30 a.m. Friday, a large number were discovered dead. Others were on the brink of death. 
 
 Sheriff's Office officials initially called the deaths a ""tragic accident"" that occurred after one of the dogs chewed through a power cord attached to an air-conditioning unit. The dogs died of heat exhaustion, they said. 
 
 But Arpaio on Monday acknowledged that the designation may have been premature, and promised a thorough investigation. 
 
 In particular, Arpaio said the owners' timeline didn't add up. 
 
 ""How can you be healthy at 11 o'clock and dead at 5:30 in the morning? I think that's the key element,"" he said. 
 
 Aubel, who had visited the facility two months prior to her vacation, said she saw no red flags Saturday morning, and that everyone was acting normal. 
 
 Looking back, she said, it did occur to her that she didn't see one of the owners' dogs like she did last time. When she checked on the kennel before, she saw a yellow lab and a black lab. On Saturday, she only spotted the owner's black lab and a wolf hybrid. 
 
 Aubel said Hughes did mention to her that his family had just returned from vacation, but did not elaborate. 
 
 Sheriff's Office spokesman Chris Hegstrom said later that the owners flew back home Friday night, after hearing the news. 
 
 After the initial drop-off, Aubel realized she left her sunglasses there and called back. When she returned to the facility to pick them up, one of the owners' daughters greeted her with them in the front yard rather than letting Aubel come back inside. 
 
 ""What really makes me upset is when I was there, the poor dogs that had passed away were right underneath my nose, and I didn't even know it,"" she said. ""We would have postponed my vacation. They should not have accepted any more dogs.""

 PHOENIX -- New allegations are coming out against the dog boarding business where 20 dogs died last week. 
 
 
 
 Valley resident Gabby Ugartte told 3TV that in the weeks before the dog tragedy struck, her mother took the family dog to Green Acre to be boarded while they vacationed in Hawaii. But when she picked up Shadow, the dog looked much different. 
 
 
 
 “My mom went to pick him up and that's when she saw his leg was swollen… two to three times [the size] his leg is actually supposed to be,” said Ugartte. 
 
 
 
 In addition to the cut and swollen paw, Shadow was covered in paint and had fur missing all over his body. Shadow's family rushed him to the vet. 
 
 
 
 “The vet said someone had either been tearing at his fur or it could have possibly been some chemical burns if they were trying to get the paint off of him. He also had a temperature of 106 degrees,” Ugartte said. 
 
 
 
 According to the American Kennel Club, normal body temperature for a dog ranges between 100 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 
 
 
 Ugartte’s family was furious and asked Green Acre for a refund. 
 
 
 
 “They said, ‘No, we feel like we earned that boarding,”’ said Ugartte. 
 
 
 
 Shadow's family went to Yelp to post their bad experience. 
 
 
 
 Green Acre didn't return calls from 3TV asking about Shadow. 
 
 
 
 Green Acre owner, MaLeisa Hughes, did respond to the Yelp post admitting that Shadow got into some paint. However, Hughes said in her post that Shadow’s family tried to 'extort' them after being told the boarding fee would not be refunded. Her post also accused Shadow of attacking his Green Acre caretakers daily -- news to Shadow's family. 
 
 
 
 “Our dog has never been a vicious dog. My little sister has Down syndrome and he's been great to her his entire life. So it was just shocking to hear [accusations of vicious behavior],” said Ugartte. 
 
 
 
 Ugartte said her family now just wants people to know the full story of what's been going on at Green Acre. 
 
 
 
 “What happened over the past couple days isn't just a one time negligence type thing. It's happened before,” said Ugartte. 
 
 
 
 Ugartte said her family is considering legal action against Green Acre. ||||| FOX 10 has obtained hidden camera footage as a person claimed a dog from the Green Acres boarding house. 
 
 
 
 For much of the video, you can only hear the owners of Green Acres talk about the deaths. 
 
 
 
 ""Can you imagine being responsible for all these deaths? It is horrifying, we have ran it over in our minds like 1000 times. There is nothing we could have done to prevent this. We operated the same way we operated the thousands of times we have done this,"" said the voice of Meliesa Hughes.Inside the home the people claiming dogs asked many questions including some about the relatives who were supposed to be watching over the dogs while the owners of the boarding house were out of town.""They didn't know what to do, so we told them to sit tight till we got here, you know what, how do you prepare yourself for something like this,"" said Hughes""We got the sheriff involved, we cooperated fully, if you guys know anything about Joe Arpaio hs is an animal proponent, and they investigated us throughly and didn't press charges, it was an accident,"" she said.Actually, it was the dog owners who first called MCSO. The owners were also asked why they told some people their pets had run away.""There is nothing in life that could have prepared us for this, so my husband panicked and made a bad decision, we did have one that ran off, that is true,"" said Hughes.""We just want to get the dog and leave, are you kidding me?, What is wrong with people? What is wrong with you? Like what is wrong with you? Did you not see what happened here today,"" she said.At the point the video ended you heard her mention that one of the dogs escaped. That dog is believed to be a Belgian malinois named Valor.Volunteers have been searching for Valor over the past few days. Sheriff Joe Arpaio said that MCSO sent a helicopter up to help in the search. There are also three mounted posse members and two deputies searching near the boarding facility.""Some people may criticize me for going to these lengths to find this dog. But after what this community has been through with this awful situation at the boarding facility, if we can find one canine survivor, we'll all feel a lot better,"" said Sheriff Joe Arpaio.Arpaio admits there is no proof that Valor escaped, they are basing this on the word of the boarding facility owners. ||||| Investigation into Gilbert dog deaths, 911 calls released Posted: Wednesday, June 25, 2014 7:29 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, June 26, 2014 12:44 AM EDT Posted:Updated: 
 
 Concern and confusion, that's what 911 calls revealed from people who left their dogs at a Gilbert boarding facility. 
 
 
 
 20 of the dogs died this weekend when caretakers say a dog chewed through an electrical cord which powered the air conditioning. 
 
 
 
 ""I don't think you understand this, you idiot, how could you do this? All you have to do was watch a dog, you killed multiple dogs,"" said a caller. 
 
 
 
 Tense and emotional 911 calls were made outside of the Gilbert boarding house when many owners first discovered their dogs had died. 
 
 
 
 ""I am trying to get my dogs now, and he won't give them to me,"" said another caller. 
 
 
 
 Other owners who were told their pets had run away also called in looking for help, ""I was just curious if you had happened to run across or if someone called in a bunch of dogs missing,"" said a caller. 
 
 
 
 Meleisa Hughes explained her husbands lie about the dogs running away. ""He panics, he told a lie, and when asked by the sheriff department he immediately corrected his mistake."" 
 
 
 
 ""If anyone of you has never told a lie in your entire life feel free to judge him on that,"" she said. 
 
 
 
 Jesus Cabrales lost his dog Sonny, but unlike many of the other dog owners who were first told about the deaths on Saturday he got a voicemail on Friday morning. 
 
 
 
 ""Hey Jesus, this is Todd with Green Acre's, I need to talk to you as soon as you can,"" said Cabrales. 
 
 
 
 After Friday came the two talked. 
 
 
 
 ""I'm sorry Jesus I have got some bad news, I think either your dog, or my dog chewed through the drywall, and one of them bit the wire which cut off the a/c, so they didn't have air all night, and they died of heat exhaustion,"" recalled Cabrales. 
 
 
 
 That Friday night at the Green Acre facility Jesus demanded to see where the accident happened. He never saw the room in the MCSO photos where investigators say the dogs were being kept. 
 
 
 
 ""I just tell him straight up, are you lying to me, tell me the truth, what really happened? And he said that is what happened, and I'm sorry, that is what happened,"" he said. 
 
 
 
 Sonny also had wounds on his legs and paws, how and when those happened isn't clear.","– Nothing seemed amiss when Snow Aubel dropped her two dogs off at a Gilbert, Ariz., kennel last Saturday morning. Just two hours later, however, police swarmed Green Acre, removing numerous dogs thought to have died sometime between Thursday night and Friday morning. In total, 20 of the 28 dogs found at the kennel were dead, and though the sheriff's office initially described the deaths as ""tragic accident"" (it explained a dog chewed through an air-conditioning unit cord), it later said that designation was premature, the Arizona Republic reports. ""How can you be healthy at 11 o'clock and dead at 5:30 in the morning? I think that's the key element,"" a sheriff said Monday. As for Aubel, she says owner Todd Hughes ""never said anything about what was going on."" Though her dogs were fine, others weren't so lucky. One owner who lost his dog tells Fox 10 the animal had wounds on his legs and paws. A family has since come forward to say they picked up their dog from the kennel weeks earlier to find he had a cut and swollen paw, was covered in paint, and had fur missing, AZFamily reports. As for the owners' initial story that the dogs ran away, owner Meliesa Hughes is heard on a hidden video acquired by Fox 10 explaining, ""my husband panicked and made a bad decision, we did have one that ran off, that is true."" The sheriff notes a helicopter has been searching for the missing dog, though there's no proof the dog did indeed escape.","<pad> The Gilbert dog kennel where 20 dogs perished last weekend continued to accept other pets into their care after the other pets had died, according to a woman who left her dogs at the facility hours before Maricopa County deputies responded to the kennel.</s>",0.13215858752081358,0.019999997496889202,0.10572686945913959
